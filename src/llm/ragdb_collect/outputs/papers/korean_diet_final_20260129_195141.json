    "title": "Dietary interventions and the gut microbiota: a systematic literature review of 80 controlled clinical trials.",
    "abstract": "The gut microbiota are increasingly recognised as key mediators of diet-related health outcomes. This systematic review primarily aimed to comprehensively evaluate associations between dietary interventions and gut microbiota in healthy and clinical adult populations, utilising controlled trials. Secondary outcomes included biological markers measured in blood, faecal, and urine samples. A systematic literature search was conducted following the PRISMA guidelines, using the electronic databases PubMed, EMBASE, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), CINAHL (via EBSCOhost), and Scopus to gather controlled trials of dietary interventions that reported within-group changes from baseline for gut microbiota and biomarkers. Study screening, data extraction, and risk-of-bias assessment were conducted by two independent reviewers. Eighty studies met the eligibility criteria, trialling 13 distinct dietary interventions: Mediterranean, Western, Korean, Japanese, Nordic, low fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAP), ketogenic, gluten-free, calorie-restricted, macronutrient altered, animal- and plant-based, as well as diets high in functional nutrients and bioactive compounds. Dietary interventions were associated with within-group changes in taxonomy and particular biological markers; however, they were not consistently associated with changes in the alpha or beta diversity of the gut microbiota. The Mediterranean, Japanese, Korean, calorie-restricted, high-polyphenol, high-fibre, plant-based, low-fat, and low-protein diets were all associated with increased abundances of either short chain fatty acids (SCFA)- or lactic acid-producing bacteria or reduced abundance of opportunistic pathogenic bacteria. Some of these diets were also associated with reduced levels of inflammatory markers. In contrast, Western, animal-based, low FODMAP, ketogenic, and gluten-free diets were associated with a reduced abundance of SCFA-producing bacteria. There was substantial heterogeneity across studies in methodology and reporting. This systematic review identifies differential associations between a wide range of dietary interventions and gut microbiota and inflammatory outcomes, both beneficial and adverse.

    "title": "Associations of dietary and physical activity behaviors with handgrip strength in middle-aged and older adults: a prospective cohort study.",
    "abstract": "Data regarding the association between dietary behaviors and handgrip strength (HS) are limited. The current study aimed to evaluate the hypothesis that dietary patterns, eating behaviors, and physical activity are associated with HS measured in later life. The study used data of 2,615 Korean adults (1,101 men and 1,514 women aged 43-74 years) without sarcopenia, who participated in a population-based prospective cohort study and completed questionnaire-based interviews and health examinations during the period of 2005 - 2014. Baseline (year 2005 - 2006) information on eating behaviors and physical exercise was obtained with dietary data, which were obtained via a food frequency questionnaire and used for dietary pattern analysis. The study outcome was HS measured at 8-year follow-up (year 2013 - 2014). Factor analysis, linear regression analysis, and modified Poisson regression analysis were performed. Sex-specific factor analysis revealed two dietary patterns labeled as \"a Balanced Diet\" characterized by a high intake of a variety of foods, and \"a Refined Carb Diet\" characterized by a high intake of refined grain foods in both men and women. In the multiple regression analysis, a higher factor score (FS) for a Balanced Diet was associated with increasing HS among women (P < 0.05) whereas a higher FS for a Refined Carb Diet was associated with decreasing HS among men (P < 0.05). Among women, slow eating behavior and irregular eating of meals were associated with decreasing HS (P < 0.05) whereas the performance of regular exercise was associated with increasing HS (P < 0.01). Similar significant results were observed in the associations with low HS, possible sarcopenia, defined as < 18 kg for women; the multivariable adjusted risk ratios (95% confidence interval) of low HS were 0.86 (0.74, 0.99) for a Balanced Diet, 1.23 (1.09, 1.40) for slow eating behavior, and 0.84 (0.72, 0.97) for regular exercise compared with its corresponding reference. These results suggest that a healthy diet consisting of a variety of foods and regular physical exercise may attenuate aging-related declines in HS and further prevent sarcopenia.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to determine whether mature silkworm pills plus commercial oral nutritional supplements (ONS) could improve cognitive function, especially in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). A total of 62 participants (70.6 ± 8.5 years, 48.4% female), aged ≥50 years diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment but not dementia, were randomly assigned into the 12-week ONS plus silkworm pill group (30 participants, commercial ONS with mature silkworm pills) or the placebo group (32 participants, placebo ONS containing protein, carbohydrates, and fats, with placebo pills containing dextrin). During the 12-week intervention, participants consumed the allocated pills and ONS once daily. Additionally, nutritional education related to the Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet therapy and proper eating habits was provided at weeks 0, 3, 6, and 9. The primary outcome was interval change in the Korean version of the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (K-RBANS) after the 12-week intervention. Secondary outcomes included interval changes in nutrient intake, nutrition-related blood test results, nutritional quotient, and MIND score evaluation. After 12 weeks, the interval change in the delayed memory domain score of the K-RBANS was improved in the ONS plus silkworm pill group (65.9 ± 19.0 vs. 70.5 ± 19.0,  After the 12-week intervention, the ONS and silkworm pill group showed a significant improvement in delayed memory compared with the placebo group. However, no significant differences were observed in other cognitive domains or secondary outcomes, such as nutrient intake, blood test results, nutrition quotient, or MIND score adherence. These findings suggest that, while the combination may have a positive impact on specific cognitive functions, further research is needed to fully understand its potential benefits and mechanisms of action. https://trialsearch.who.int/Trial2.aspx?TrialID=KCT0007304.",

    "abstract": "Despite substantial research investments aiming to prevent cancer and develop therapeutic interventions, cancer remains a formidable challenge. In view of the persistent rise in cancer prevalence, the condition should also be recognised as a chronic disease. Such an approach can enhance the quality of life of patients with cancer, inhibit treatment-related adverse events and prevent recurrence via comprehensive post-treatment management. The core objective of this study is to investigate the association between dietary factors and treatment-related adverse events in patients with cancer, with the aim of providing individualised dietary recommendations to reduce adverse events and enhance quality of life. The study cohort will include 600 participants aged ≥20 years. The participants will be assessed for dietary intake, cancer therapy-related adverse events and single-nucleotide polymorphisms using genomic DNA extracted from saliva. In addition, general and clinical information, lifestyle patterns and general/biochemical data of the blood will also be collected. The primary outcome is dietary factors that mitigate chemotherapeutic adverse events, and the secondary outcome is the association between nutritional status and survival in Korean patients with cancer. Considering the potential impact of dietary habits on the adverse events of cancer treatment, the findings of this study can be used as a basis for the establishment of new dietary guidelines for patients with cancer. The Institutional Review Board of Severance Hospital, Yonsei University Health System, Seoul, Korea, approved the study protocol (4-2021-1110). Further, all participants provided a written informed consent prior to the study. The findings will be shared via publications.",

    "abstract": "Cancer significantly impacts patients' psychological well-being. While nutrition is crucial in cancer care, the specific role of ultra-processed food (UPF) consumption on mental health in this population is underexplored. This study aimed to investigate the associations between UPF intake, genetic predisposition to UPF intake, and psychological well-being in a general adult cohort, with effects varying by cancer subgroups. This study included 53,057 participants from the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study (KoGES), with low rates of new (0.11 %-0.72 %) and persistent cancers (0.06 %-0.72 %) across thyroid, breast, lung, gastric, and colon types. UPF intake was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire and dichotomized. Through logistic regression, we identified 22 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with UPF intake, which were used to construct a polygenic risk score (PRS). The primary outcome was the Psychological Well-being Index (PWI), derived from the CES-D scale. We used generalized linear models (GLM) to analyze the associations, adjusting for demographic, lifestyle, and cancer status changes (thyroid, breast, lung, stomach, colon). High UPF intake was significantly associated with higher PWI scores, indicating poorer psychological well-being (β = 0.44, P < 0.001). A higher PRS, based on 22 SNPs primarily located in the MHC class II region and OAS gene cluster, was independently associated with increased PWI (β = 6.02, P = 0.005), suggesting a genetic link to inflammation and immune responses influencing mental health. New diagnoses of lung (β = 2.00, P = 0.007) and thyroid cancer (β = 0.67, P = 0.022), and persistent colon (β = 0.93, P = 0.040) and breast cancer (β = 0.65, P = 0.032), were associated with significantly higher PWI scores. Both high UPF intake and a genetic predisposition to it are independently associated with increased psychological distress in a general adult cohort, with subgroup analyses for incident and persistent cancer cases. These associations vary by cancer type and status, highlighting the need for personalized nutritional and psycho-oncological interventions to improve quality of life in this vulnerable population.",

We aimed to evaluate the associations of adherence to the 2018 and the 2007 World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research (WCRF/AICR) and the 2012 American Cancer Society (ACS) guidelines with risks of multiple cancer outcomes. This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted by searching cohort studies across PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Scopus, from database inception to July 31, 2025. We assessed associations between adherence to the three major global cancer prevention guidelines: the 2018 WCRF/AICR guidelines, the 2007 WCRF/AICR guidelines, and the 2012 ACS guidelines, and the risk of total cancer, obesity-related cancer, and 13 site-specific cancers (Colorectal, Breast, Lung, Prostate, Bladder, Kidney, Stomach, Pancreas, Esophagus, Liver, Ovary, Uterus, Gallbladder).

    "abstract": "Managing blood glucose levels before conception and during pregnancy is crucial for ensuring optimal maternal and fetal outcomes. However, little is known about the impact of maintaining fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels within a specific range on pregnancy and neonatal morbidities, especially in women with diabetes mellitus (DM). We aimed to evaluate the effects of maternal prepregnancy FPG levels on pregnancy and neonatal morbidity in women with pregestational DM. This retrospective nationwide study included singleton pregnant women diagnosed with DM who underwent health screening. We compared the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs) and neonatal morbidity based on prepregnancy FPG levels. Multivariate analyses were performed to estimate odds ratios for the risk of APOs and neonatal morbidity. A total of 7,542 women were included in the analysis. After adjusting for covariates, as FPG levels increased, there was a tendency for a higher risk of preterm birth, macrosomia, and large-for-gestational-age (LGA) babies. Compared to mothers with FPG levels below 85 mg/dL, pregestational FPG ≥ 126 mg/dL was associated with an increased risk of neonatal morbidities such as transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN), respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), and neonatal hypoglycemia. Elevated prepregnancy FPG levels were associated with higher frequencies of preterm birth, macrosomia, and LGA. Neonates born to women with diabetes-range FPG had higher rates of TTN, RDS, and neonatal hypoglycemia. Prospective longitudinal studies incorporating both prepregnancy and gestational glycemic status are needed to establish the causal relationship between glycemic control and pregnancy outcomes in women with diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Iodine is an essential mineral that is critical for humans, as inadequate and excessive intake can lead to adverse health outcomes. Data on dietary iodine intake and adequacy among Koreans remain limited. This study aimed to estimate the dietary iodine intake of Koreans, assess the adequacy of intake, and examine the primary dietary sources of iodine in the Korean population. This study analyzed data from 18,895 participants aged ≥ 1 yr obtained from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) 2019-2021. Dietary iodine intake was calculated using a newly constructed iodine database applied to KNHANES data. Intake levels were compared against the sex- and age-specific reference values outlined in the Korean Dietary Reference Intakes 2020. Insufficient intake was below the estimated average requirement (EAR), while excessive intake was above the tolerable upper intake level (UL). The median iodine intake of Koreans aged ≥ 1 yr was 114 µg/d, corresponding to 123% of the EAR. Approximately 4 in 10 Koreans did not meet the EAR, one exceeded the UL, and only 5 had adequate iodine intake. Excessive intake was most prevalent among children under 12 yrs of age. Two-thirds of iodine intake came from plant-based foods, with seaweed, eggs, fish, milk, and grains identified as the major dietary contributors. Koreans' median dietary iodine intake appears adequate; however, a significant proportion exhibit insufficient or excessive intake. Further research is needed to estimate usual iodine intake and develop strategies for addressing problematic iodine intake.",

This study aimed to investigate the association between adherence to various dietary patterns and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality in a middle-aged Korean MASLD population. Baseline data from 32,091 adults aged 40 years and older enrolled in the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study (KoGES) between 2004 and 2013 were analyzed. Dietary intake was assessed using a validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire, and principal component analysis was applied to identify distinct dietary patterns.

Adherence to the Korean Mediterranean-style diet was associated with a significantly reduced risk of CVD mortality in MASLD patients, with those in the highest Korean Mediterranean-style diet pattern quartile having a 33% lower risk than those in the lowest quartile (hazards ratio: 0.67, 95% confidence interval: 0.45-1.00, p = 0.048). Other dietary patterns, including the processed food and dairy diet, animal protein-rich diet, grain-based diet, as well as refined carbohydrate and fat-rich diet, were not significantly associated with CVD mortality. Adherence to Korean Mediterranean-style diet pattern was associated with a lower risk of CVD mortality in Korean adults with MASLD, highlighting its potential as an effective dietary strategy for managing cardiovascular risk in MASLD patients, even in non-Western populations.",

    "abstract": "It is currently unknown whether plant-based dietary patterns influence disease progression to multimorbidity after an initial non-communicable disease, and whether the associated risk of multimorbidity varies with age. This study aimed to investigate associations of plant-based diets with the risk of multimorbidity, defined as the co-occurrence of at least two chronic diseases in an individual (either cancer at any site, cardiovascular disease, or type 2 diabetes). This prospective cohort study used data from EPIC and UK Biobank across six European countries, with participants aged 35-70 years at recruitment. We excluded participants from these cohorts who had cancer, cardiovascular disease, or type 2 diabetes at baseline or those with missing data on diet or health outcomes. Data on dietary habits were assessed either at baseline through a validated dietary questionnaire about habits in the previous 12 months or through several 24-h recall questionnaires during approximately a year of follow-up. Multistate modelling with Cox regression was used to estimate the risk of multimorbidity according to a healthful plant-based diet index (hPDI) and, separately, an unhealthful plant-based diet index (uPDI). Risk differences in adults younger than 60 years and those age 60 years and older were estimated. 407 618 participants (226 324 from EPIC and 181 294 from UK Biobank) were included in this study. During a median follow-up time of 10·9 years in EPIC and 11·4 years in UK Biobank, 6604 cancer-cardiometabolic multimorbidity events occurred in both cohorts combined. A ten-point increment of the hPDI score was associated with a lower risk of multimorbidity, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0·89 (95% CI 0·83-0·96) in EPIC and 0·81 (0·76-0·86) in UK Biobank. This inverse association was marginally weaker in older adults than in middle-aged adults in both cohorts. In UK Biobank, a ten-point increment of the hPDI score was associated with multivariable-adjusted HRs of 0·71 (95% CI 0·65-0·79) in adults younger than 60 years and 0·86 (0·80-0·92) in those aged 60 years and older (p A healthy plant-based diet might reduce the burden of multimorbidity of cancer and cardiometabolic diseases among middle-aged and older adults.

Individual-level variables included gender, age, education, income, number of household members, smoking, drinking, physical activity, and subjective health status. Neighborhood-level variables included residential area, housing type, number of restaurants per capita, population size, and the proportion of low-income households and older adults. Associations with the Korean Healthy Eating Index (KHEI) were assessed using 2-level hierarchical models. Of the total variance in KHEI, 5.2% was attributable to neighborhood-level differences. Individual-level factors explained 48.1% of variance at the neighborhood-level, while neighborhood-level factors accounted for an additional 12.4%. Individuals living in rural areas, non-apartment housing, neighborhoods with higher proportions of low-income households and older adults, or in areas with smaller populations, had lower KHEI scores than their counterparts. In random slope models with cross-level interaction terms, diet quality among adults aged 70 years and older varied significantly according to neighborhood- level characteristics. Both individual-level and neighborhood-level factors influence diet quality in Korea, with older adults being especially vulnerable to neighborhood characteristics. Multilevel approaches are needed to identify at-risk populations and improve dietary outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Functional dyspepsia (FD) is a common gastrointestinal disorder affecting 10-20% of the global population. This case series aimed to report the clinical outcomes of three patients with FD who were treated with eight constitution acupuncture (ECA) and eight constitution diet (ECD), a personalized treatment approach based on the eight constitution medicine (ECM) theory. Three patients with chronic FD were retrospectively selected from two Korean medical clinics. Each patient underwent ECA and ECD according to their constitution type as determined by pulse diagnosis. FD symptoms and quality of life were assessed using the Nepean Dyspepsia Index-Korean version (NDI-K) and Functional Dyspepsia-Quality of Life (FD-QoL) scores before and 2 and 4 weeks post-treatment. Adherence to treatment and adverse events were also evaluated. All three patients showed significant improvements in NDI-K and FD-QoL scores after 4 weeks of treatment. No adverse events were observed during the treatment period. In particular, one patient experienced temporary symptom relapse due to poor dietary adherence, suggesting that the effectiveness of ECD may be associated with adherence to the prescribed diet. ECA combined with ECD led to significant symptom improvement and improved the quality of life in patients with chronic FD. These findings support the potential use of ECM-based interventions as effective and personalized treatment approaches for FD. More studies with larger sample sizes and standardized tools to assess diet adherence are required to validate these results and explore long-term outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Digital health interventions are increasingly used to promote behaviour change in adolescents. The Living Lab approach, fostering collaboration with users and stakeholders to identify real-life problems and co-create sustainable solutions, is gaining traction in health interventions. This study aimed to evaluate the usability of a novel Digital-based Living Lab (D-LLab) designed to promote healthy dietary behaviour in adolescents. The D-LLab was developed in four phases: topic derivation, strategy selection, digital tool selection, and usability assessment. It was implemented over a 4-week period, structured into four participatory phases: identifying problems, exploring solutions, solving problems, and sharing outcomes. Twenty-one adolescents aged 14-16 from one middle school enrolled, with a balanced sample of racial and ethnic adolescents, and native Koreans. Usability was evaluated using a mixed methods approach, incorporating quantitative indicators-appropriateness (system usability scale, SUS), acceptability (satisfaction), and feasibility (completion rate)-alongside qualitative data on participant experiences. The mean SUS score was 70.75, exceeding the benchmark for acceptable usability. Participants rated high satisfaction (mean score: 8.45/10), and 95.2% completed all sessions. High usability appeared to be driven by real-time information sharing and collaborative digital interaction, which supported spontaneous problem solving around dietary issues. The D-LLab demonstrated acceptable usability and strong participant engagement. These findings highlight the feasibility of applying digital-based Living Lab approaches in school settings, warranting further trials to evaluate long-term behavioural impact across diverse populations. This intervention was registered at cris.nih.go.kr as KCT0007004.",

    "abstract": "Metabolism-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is the most prevalent chronic liver condition worldwide and affects nearly 30% of the global population. While traditionally associated with metabolic risk factors, such as obesity and insulin resistance, increasing attention is being directed toward socioeconomic and environmental determinants that contribute to disparities in MASLD prevalence and outcomes. Low-income populations often experience higher rates of MASLD owing to limited access to healthcare, poor diet quality, and reduced opportunities for physical activity. Conversely, high-income countries are witnessing a paradoxical rise in MASLD cases, driven by sedentary lifestyles and excessive consumption of ultra-processed foods. This review examined the effects of socioeconomic status, education, healthcare access, and environmental exposure on the epidemiology of MASLD. The findings revealed that individuals from lower socioeconomic backgrounds and migrant populations experience a disproportionately higher burden of MASLD due to systemic healthcare barriers, dietary transitions, and occupational exposure. Children and adolescents face increasing susceptibility owing to rising obesity rates, and geographic disparities highlight Europe as the most affected region, followed by Asia and North America. Given the growing public health impact of MASLD, addressing both socioeconomic and environmental determinants is essential. Future efforts should prioritize policy-driven interventions, including equitable healthcare access, lifestyle modifications, and research into novel therapeutic approaches to mitigate the disease burden and improve patient outcomes.",

This cohort study involved 148 438 South Korean adults aged 40 years and older. Meal frequency at the baseline survey was assessed using a validated FFQ. Outcomes included all-cause mortality, cancer mortality and CVD mortality. Cox proportional hazards regression models were employed to examine the relationship between meal frequency and the risk of mortality. Mediation analyses were performed with changes in obesity indices (BMI and weight circumference (WC)) as mediators. In comparison to the three-time group, the once-per-day and four-times-per-day groups had a higher risk for all-cause mortality. The irregular frequency group had a higher risk for CVD mortality. Both once-per-day and four-times-per-day groups exhibited higher risks for cancer mortality. The effect of meal frequency on all-cause mortality was partially mediated by WC. For specific-cause mortality, similar mediation effects were found. The data suggests that three meals per day have a lower mortality and longer life expectancy compared with other meal frequencies. Increased waist circumference partially mediates this effect. These findings support the implementation of a strategy that addresses meal frequency and weight reduction together.",

    "abstract": "Ultra-processed foods are linked to adverse health outcomes, making it crucial to monitor consumption trends. Despite rising consumption due to Westernized diets in Asia, long-term studies targeting Asian adults are lacking. Thus, we analyzed ultra-processed food consumption trends among Korean adults from 1998 to 2022. Additionally, we compared intakes before and during the pandemic to evaluate the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, we compared the nutrient profiles of ultra-processed and non-ultra-processed food group intakes. This study used data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) from 1998 to 2022, classifying food into four NOVA groups. Dietary intake was assessed In 2020-2022, ultra-processed foods had a higher proportion using a single 24-hour recall for 96,447 individuals aged 20 years or older. Sampling weights were applied to adjust for the complex survey design and non-responses. We calculated the weighted means and confidence intervals for the proportion of energy intake by NOVA food groups and various nutrient profiles. The proportion of energy intake from ultra-processed foods among Korean adults steadily increased from 17.41% in 1998-2005 to 26.71% in 2016-2019 (mean difference: 9.30% [95% CI, 8.62-9.98%]), but declined for the first time during the pandemic, falling to 25.33% (mean difference: -1.39% [95% CI, -2.18% to -0.59%]). In 2020-2022, ultra-processed foods had a higher proportion of calories from carbohydrates (62.12% vs. 58.81%) and fats (28.22% vs. 22.31%) but a lower proportion from protein (10.32% vs. 17.26%) compared to non-ultra-processed foods. From 1998 to 2022, the fat content of both ultra-processed and non-ultra-processed foods significantly increased, rising from 26.24 to 28.15% for ultra-processed foods (mean difference: 1.91% [95% CI, 1.33-2.49%]) and from 16.81 to 22.26% for non-ultra-processed foods (mean difference: 5.45% [95% CI, 4.99-5.91%]). This study examined 25-year trends in ultra-processed food consumption among South Koreans, showing a consistent increase in energy intake from ultra-processed foods until the COVID-19 pandemic, during which it declined for the first time. However, this decline may be temporary, underscoring the need for sustained efforts to reduce ultra-processed food consumption.",

    "abstract": "MetaDAG is a web-based tool developed to address challenges posed by big data from omics technologies, particularly in metabolic network reconstruction and analysis. The tool is capable of constructing metabolic networks for specific organisms, sets of organisms, reactions, enzymes, or KEGG Orthology (KO) identifiers. By retrieving data from the KEGG database, MetaDAG helps users visualize and analyze complex metabolic interactions efficiently. MetaDAG computes two models: a reaction graph and a metabolic directed acyclic graph (m-DAG). The reaction graph represents reactions as nodes and metabolite flow between them as edges. The m-DAG simplifies the reaction graph by collapsing strongly connected components, significantly reducing the number of nodes while maintaining connectivity. MetaDAG can generate metabolic networks from various inputs, including KEGG organisms or custom data (e.g., reactions, enzymes, KOs). The tool displays these models on an interactive web page and provides downloadable files, including network visualizations. MetaDAG was tested using two datasets. In an eukaryotic analysis, it successfully classified organisms from the KEGG database at the kingdom and phylum levels. In a microbiome study, MetaDAG accurately distinguished between Western and Korean diets and categorized individuals by weight loss outcomes based on dietary interventions. MetaDAG offers an effective and versatile solution for metabolic network reconstruction from diverse data sources, enabling large-scale biological comparisons. Its ability to generate synthetic metabolisms and its broad application, from taxonomy classification to diet analysis, make it a valuable tool for biological research.

    "title": "Effects of sarcopenic obesity on incident chronic kidney disease and rapid kidney function decline: evidence from the China health and retirement longitudinal study.",
    "abstract": "Evidence on the effects of sarcopenic obesity (SO) on incident chronic kidney disease (CKD) and rapid kidney function decline (RKFD) in the Chinese population is limited. This study aimed to prospectively examine the associations of SO with incident CKD and RKFD among middle-aged and older Chinese adults. This prospective cohort study utilized data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), a nationally representative longitudinal study of Chinese adults aged 45 and older. The analysis included 4201 individuals from the 2011 wave, with renal outcomes ascertained from the 2015 wave. The effects of SO on incident CKD and RKFD were assessed using logistic regression models. Robustness was tested through subgroup and sensitivity analyses. Over four years of follow-up, 228 cases of incident CKD and 213 cases of RKFD were observed. After multivariable adjustment, participants in the \"sarcopenic obesity\" group showed a 78% increased risk of incident CKD (odds ratio [OR] 1.78, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.09-2.90) and a 79% increased risk of RKFD (OR 1.79, 95% CI 1.03-3.13), compared to the \"nonsarcopenia without obesity\" group. Consistent results were observed across subgroups stratified by gender, education level, marital status, geographic area, lifestyle factors, and comorbidities, with no significant interactions detected. In a population-based cohort of middle-aged and older Chinese adults, SO was independently associated with elevated risks of incident CKD and RKFD, without interaction effects. These findings underscore the importance of timely intervention for SO to prevent adverse kidney outcomes. Key message What is already known on this topic?  The relationship between sarcopenic obesity (SO) and the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and renal function decline has been established in Korean and Japanese individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, it is uncertain if these findings apply to other populations, particularly those without diabetes. Additionally, the influence of diabetes on these associations needs further exploration, and the link between SO and rapid kidney function decline (RKFD) remains unestablished. Evidence regarding the effects of SO on incident CKD and RKFD in the Chinese population is limited, highlighting the necessity for this study to fill these gaps in knowledge. What this study adds  This study is the first to prospectively explore the association of SO with incident CKD and RKFD in middle-aged and older Chinese adults. We identified SO as a significant risk factor for increased incidence of both CKD and RKFD. These findings expand the understanding of the impact of SO beyond individuals with diabetes mellitus, indicating that SO is a universal risk factor for adverse kidney outcomes in aging populations, irrespective of demographic and health characteristics. How this study might affect research, practice, or policy  This study identifies SO as an independent risk factor for incident CKD and RKFD in middle-aged and older Chinese adults. The findings suggest that SO is a modifiable risk factor for kidney health, underscoring the necessity for timely interventions to prevent adverse kidney outcomes. Given the rising prevalence of SO and kidney disease in aging populations worldwide, these results highlight the importance of incorporating SO management into public health and clinical strategies. Questions pending answer  What role do specific lifestyle factors (e.g. diet, physical activity) play in mitigating or exacerbating kidney function decline in individuals with SO? Are there genetic markers that predispose individuals with SO to a higher risk of incident CKD and RKFD? What are the underlying molecular mechanisms linking SO to incident CKD and RKFD?",

    "abstract": "Diet is one of the important exposure sources for many urinary chemicals that have been investigated in association studies for thyroid hormone outcomes. For these chemicals, the fasting status can substantially affect the results of urinary biomonitoring of the study population. Such variability presents challenges for cross-sectional association studies, particularly when the substances of concern have short excretion half-lives. This study aims to investigate how fasting influences the association of urinary levels of phthalate metabolites and phenolics, with thyroid hormones among Korean women of childbearing age. In the total population, comprising both fasting and non-fasting groups, monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP) and di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) metabolites showed negative associations with total and free T4, and positive associations with total T3 and the estimates of peripheral deiodinase activity (GD). In the non-fasting group, while the overall direction of associations remained consistent, the association of phthalate metabolites became more pronounced. In contrast, the significant associations disappeared in the fasting group. The non-fasting group showed higher levels of most phthalate metabolites than their fasting counterparts. For parabens, similar negative associations with free T4 and total T4 were observed in both fasting and non-fasting groups. These observations suggest that diets are more important exposure sources of phthalates, and hence, fasting may bias the exposure profile of these chemicals and the results of association studies. This study underscores the need to consider fasting status in association studies of urinary chemicals with short half-lives to prevent the potentially misleading influence of fasting on these associations.",

    "abstract": "Observational studies have reported that diabetes is a risk factor that increases the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). However, the causal relationship remains a matter of debate. This study aimed to analyze the relationship between fasting serum glucose (FSG) and ASCVD. This study used data from the Korean Cancer Prevention Study-II (KCPS-II) Biobank, consisting of 159,844 people recruited with consent from 18 health examination centers from 2004 to 2013. Outcomes were confirmed based on diagnoses on hospital discharge summaries from National Health Insurance System. We used linear and non-linear Mendelian randomization (MR) methods. The outcome data were obtained from KCPS-II, and the exposure data were derived from the Korean Genome Epidemiology Study. First, a prospective cohort study estimated that for each 10 mg/dL increase in FSG level, the risk of ASCVD increased by 5% (hazard ratio [HR], 1.05; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04 to 1.06). Second, the 2-sample MR study showed that every 10 mg/dL increase in FSG influenced the risk of ASCVD (odds ratio [OR], 1.11; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.18). Third, the multivariable MR study showed that the OR per 10 mg/dL increase in FSG on ASCVD was 1.14 (p<0.001). Similar results were found for a 10 mg/dL increase in FSG and ischemic heart disease (IHD), but a significant relationship with stroke was not found. When performing non-linear MR, a linear relationship was observed between fasting blood sugar and ASCVD, including IHD and stroke. FSG showed a linear and causal association with IHD, but not with stroke.",

    "title": "The burden of diseases, injuries, and risk factors by state in the USA, 1990-2021: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021.",
    "abstract": "The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2021 provides a comprehensive assessment of health and risk factor trends at global, regional, national, and subnational levels. This study aims to examine the burden of diseases, injuries, and risk factors in the USA and highlight the disparities in health outcomes across different states. GBD 2021 analysed trends in mortality, morbidity, and disability for 371 diseases and injuries and 88 risk factors in the USA between 1990 and 2021. We used several metrics to report sources of health and health loss related to specific diseases, injuries, and risk factors. GBD 2021 methods accounted for differences in data sources and biases. The analysis of levels and trends for causes and risk factors within the same computational framework enabled comparisons across states, years, age groups, and sex. GBD 2021 estimated years lived with disability (YLDs) and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs; the sum of years of life lost to premature mortality and YLDs) for 371 diseases and injuries, years of life lost (YLLs) and mortality for 288 causes of death, and life expectancy and healthy life expectancy (HALE). We provided estimates for 88 risk factors in relation to 155 health outcomes for 631 risk-outcome pairs and produced risk-specific estimates of summary exposure value, relative health risk, population attributable fraction, and risk-attributable burden measured in DALYs and deaths. Estimates were produced by sex (male and female), age (25 age groups from birth to ≥95 years), and year (annually between 1990 and 2021). 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) were generated for all final estimates as the 2·5th and 97·5th percentiles values of 500 draws (ie, 500 random samples from the estimate's distribution). Uncertainty was propagated at each step of the estimation process. We found disparities in health outcomes and risk factors across US states. Our analysis of GBD 2021 highlighted the relative decline in life expectancy and HALE compared with other countries, as well as the impact of COVID-19 during the first 2 years of the pandemic. We found a decline in the USA's ranking of life expectancy from 1990 to 2021: in 1990, the USA ranked 35th of 204 countries and territories for males and 19th for females, but dropped to 46th for males and 47th for females in 2021. When comparing life expectancy in the best-performing and worst-performing US states against all 203 other countries and territories (excluding the USA as a whole), Hawaii (the best-ranked state in 1990 and 2021) dropped from sixth-highest life expectancy in the world for males and fourth for females in 1990 to 28th for males and 22nd for females in 2021. The worst-ranked state in 2021 ranked 107th for males (Mississippi) and 99th for females (West Virginia). 14 US states lost life expectancy over the study period, with West Virginia experiencing the greatest loss (2·7 years between 1990 and 2021). HALE ranking declines were even greater; in 1990, the USA was ranked 42nd for males and 32nd for females but dropped to 69th for males and 76th for females in 2021. When comparing HALE in the best-performing and worst-performing US states against all 203 other countries and territories, Hawaii ranked 14th highest HALE for males and fifth for females in 1990, dropping to 39th for males and 34th for females in 2021. In 2021, West Virginia-the lowest-ranked state that year-ranked 141st for males and 137th for females. Nationally, age-standardised mortality rates declined between 1990 and 2021 for many leading causes of death, most notably for ischaemic heart disease (56·1% [95% UI 55·1-57·2] decline), lung cancer (41·9% [39·7-44·6]), and breast cancer (40·9% [38·7-43·7]). Over the same period, age-standardised mortality rates increased for other causes, particularly drug use disorders (878·0% [770·1-1015·5]), chronic kidney disease (158·3% [149·6-167·9]), and falls (89·7% [79·8-95·8]). We found substantial variation in mortality rates between states, with Hawaii having the lowest age-standardised mortality rate (433·2 per 100 000 [380·6-493·4]) in 2021 and Mississippi having the highest (867·5 per 100 000 [772·6-975·7]). Hawaii had the lowest age-standardised mortality rates throughout the study period, whereas Washington, DC, experienced the most improvement (a 40·7% decline [33·2-47·3]). Only six countries had age-standardised rates of YLDs higher than the USA in 2021: Afghanistan, Lesotho, Liberia, Mozambique, South Africa, and the Central African Republic, largely because the impact of musculoskeletal disorders, mental disorders, and substance use disorders on age-standardised disability rates in the USA is so large. At the state level, eight US states had higher age-standardised YLD rates than any country in the world: West Virginia, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, New Mexico, Ohio, Tennessee, and Arizona. Low back pain was the leading cause of YLDs in the USA in 1990 and 2021, although the age-standardised rate declined by 7·9% (1·8-13·0) from 1990. Depressive disorders (56·0% increase [48·2-64·3]) and drug use disorders (287·6% [247·9-329·8]) were the second-leading and third-leading causes of age-standardised YLDs in 2021. For females, mental health disorders had the highest age-standardised YLD rate, with an increase of 59·8% (50·6-68·5) between 1990 and 2021. Hawaii had the lowest age-standardised rates of YLDs for all sexes combined (12 085·3 per 100 000 [9090·8-15 557·1]), whereas West Virginia had the highest (14 832·9 per 100 000 [11 226·9-18 882·5]). At the national level, the leading GBD Level 2 risk factors for death for all sexes combined in 2021 were high systolic blood pressure, high fasting plasma glucose, and tobacco use. From 1990 to 2021, the age-standardised mortality rates attributable to high systolic blood pressure decreased by 47·8% (43·4-52·5) and for tobacco use by 5·1% (48·3%-54·1%), but rates increased for high fasting plasma glucose by 9·3% (0·4-18·7). The burden attributable to risk factors varied by age and sex. For example, for ages 15-49 years, the leading risk factors for death were drug use, high alcohol use, and dietary risks. By comparison, for ages 50-69 years, tobacco was the leading risk factor for death, followed by dietary risks and high BMI. GBD 2021 provides valuable information for policy makers, health-care professionals, and researchers in the USA at the national and state levels to prioritise interventions, allocate resources effectively, and assess the effects of health policies and programmes. By addressing socioeconomic determinants, risk behaviours, environmental influences, and health disparities among minority populations, the USA can work towards improving health outcomes so that people can live longer and healthier lives.

    "title": "Korean Food Exchange Lists for Diabetes Meal Planning: Revised 2023.",
    "abstract": "A food exchange list is a tool developed to help diabetic patients control their energy intake and plan balanced meals. Korean food exchange lists were first developed in 1988, revised in 1995, and updated again in 2010. With rapidly changing dietary habits and increasing demand for diverse food cultures, the Korean Diabetes Association in cooperation with 4 related organizations established a Task Force Team (TFT) to revise food exchange lists in March 2022. Starting with a workshop, TFT held 11 official revision meetings, culminating in a public hearing in May 2023. The final revised version of Korean food exchange lists was published in December 2023. Key outcomes of the revision are summarized as follows: 1. Based on the National Standard Food Composition Table 10.0 database, the existing classification system and nutrient standards for each food group remain unchanged this time. 2. Based on a survey conducted among diabetes educators, the number of items on the food exchange lists has increased from 339 in 2010 to 435 this time. 3. Considering patients' usual eating habits, meal planning examples were developed distributing food group exchange units by energy level based on 3 types of proportions of carbohydrate energy (40%-45%, 50%-55%, 60%-65%). 4. Due to limitations in real-time updates for rapidly changing information, detailed guidance on how to access and interpret the data is provided. These revisions will help people with diabetes manage their blood sugar levels and facilitate the implementation of healthy meal planning in various other conditions, including obesity.",

    "abstract": "Sarcopenia is a geriatric disease characterized by loss of muscle mass and strength. Although combined exercise and nutrition intervention are known to be effective for sarcopenia, clinical trials involving outpatients with sarcopenia in primary care are scarce. We describe a protocol for a trial to examine the effects of a 12-week combined exercise and nutrition intervention in Korean older adults with possible sarcopenia in community-based primary care. This multicenter, randomized, controlled trial will include 94 community-dwelling older outpatients aged 65-85 years with possible sarcopenia (47 participants in the intervention and control groups each). Resistance exercises, which incorporate concentric and eccentric exercises, will consist of an introductory phase (3 weeks: twice-weekly supervised exercise sessions and once-weekly home exercises; contraction exercises), an expanded phase (3 weeks: twice-weekly supervised exercise sessions and once-weekly home exercises; eccentric exercises), and a maintenance phase (6 weeks: once-weekly supervised exercise sessions and twice-weekly home exercises; power/eccentric exercises). Nutritional supplementation will be provided according to the nutritional status of the participants using a Mini-Nutritional Assessment. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 12 and 24 weeks, and the primary outcome will be the 5-times chair stand test results. To the best of our knowledge, this will be the first clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of a combined exercise and nutritional supplementation intervention in older outpatients with possible sarcopenia in community-based primary care clinics. These findings will provide new insights to clinicians regarding the long-term usability for doctors and outpatients with possible sarcopenia in community-based primary care. This trial was prospectively registered at ClinicalTrials.gov on September 16, 2023 (registration number: NCT06049914).",

    "abstract": "Understanding the impact of early-life nutritional choices on neurodevelopment in children is a growing area of research. To investigate the association between dietary patterns at multiple timelines and neurodevelopmental outcomes in 6-year-old children. This administrative observational study utilized a merged data from the national health insurance database and the health screening program for children. Information on the diet patterns from infancy to 3 years of age was obtained from parent-administered questionnaires. Dietary pattern clusters of the participants were identified using Polytomous Latent Class Analysis. The outcome was neurodevelopment using the Korean Developmental Screening Test (K-DST) at the age of 6 years. The study identified four distinct clusters among with the 133,243 eligible children (49.6% male, birth weight 3.22 kg, head circumference 42.7 cm at 4 months). The control cluster (53.4%) exhibited a diet including breast milk feeding and a variety of dietary patterns at the age of 1 year. In contrast, cluster 1 (36.0%) showed a skewed dietary pattern at the same age. Cluster 2 (6.6%) displayed diverse dietary patterns at one year but primarily consumed formula at four months, while cluster 3 (4.0%) had reduced dietary diversity and formula feeding. Compared with the control cluster, the adjusted odds ratio for unfavorable development was 1.209 (95% CI, 1.156-1.266) in cluster 1, 1.418 (95% CI, 1.312-1.532) in cluster 2, and 1.741 (95% CI, 1.593-1.903) in cluster 3. These findings remained consistent across individual domains of the K-DST. Dietary patterns during infancy and early childhood may be associated with neurodevelopment at the age of 6 years.",

    "abstract": "Although nuts are a well-known healthy food group, the relationship between nut consumption and mortality remains unclear, particularly among Asians. This prospective cohort study examined the association between nut consumption and the risk of all-cause, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and cancer mortality in Korean adults. Data from two cohorts (the Ansan-Ansung and Health-Examinees) from the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study were used. A total of 114,140 individuals aged 40-79 years were included in the data analyses. Nut consumption was assessed using a validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire and categorized into four groups: non-consumers, less than 1 serving/week, 1-2 servings/week, and 2 or more servings/week (one serving was 15 g of nuts). Mortality outcomes were determined based on the 2001-2021 death records from Statistics Korea. Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for mortality across nut consumption categories. A stratified subgroup analysis by health-related variables was also performed. During a mean follow-up of 12.3 years, 4,559 deaths were recorded. After adjusting for covariates, the HR for all-cause mortality was 0.877 (95% CI = 0.772-0.996, p for trend = 0.006) in individuals with a nut consumption of 2 or more servings/week compared with that in non-consumers. Multivariable HRs for CVD mortality were 0.800 (95% CI = 0.681-0.939) in individuals consuming less than 1 serving/week, 0.656 (95% CI = 0.469-0.918) in those consuming 1-2 servings/week, and 1.009 (95% CI = 0.756-1.347) in those consuming 2 or more servings/week compared with that in non-consumers (p for trend = 0.080). No association was observed between nut consumption and cancer mortality. Stratified analysis identified significant interactions in the association between nut consumption and all-cause mortality by age, body mass index, and physical activity. Nut consumption was linearly associated with the reduced risk of all-cause mortality and showed a non-linear dose-response relationship with CVD mortality in Koreans, but had no association with cancer mortality. The effects of nut consumption, which have been inadequately investigated in this population, varied across different subgroups. These findings suggest that incorporating nuts into the diet should be encouraged for long-term health of Korean adults.",

    "title": "A higher dietary inflammatory index score is associated with an increased risk of developing dyslipidemia and its components only in women.",
    "abstract": "The dietary inflammatory index (DII) is a tool to evaluate the inflammatory potential of diets. Our research hypothesized that a higher DII score would be associated with an increased risk of dyslipidemia and that this outcome may differ by sex. Data from the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study were used. The analysis included participants aged 40 to 69 years from the HEXA study (n = 40,500) and the Ansan-Ansung study (n = 4701). The mean follow-up was 5.03 years for the HEXA study and 8.14 years for the Ansan-Ansung study. The DII scores were calculated based on dietary data. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to calculate hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). In pooled analyses, a high DII score was associated with a higher risk of dyslipidemia and its components. Sex-specific analyses revealed associations only in women. A pro-inflammatory diet, as indicated by a higher DII score, was associated with an increased risk of hypercholesterolemia, hyper-low-density lipoprotein cholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and dyslipidemia, with HR of 1.17 (95% CI: 1.06, 1.29), 1.16 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.29), 1.32 (95% CI: 1.12, 1.52), and 1.17 (95% CI: 1.08, 1.26), respectively. However, among men, there was no association between DII and dyslipidemia. These findings emphasize the inflammation feature of existing dietary patterns in influencing the development of dyslipidemia and related health issues. Further research will be needed to identify the mechanisms of how DII scores affect the risk of dyslipidemia.",

    "abstract": "Up-to-date estimates of stroke burden and attributable risks and their trends at global, regional, and national levels are essential for evidence-based health care, prevention, and resource allocation planning. We aimed to provide such estimates for the period 1990-2021. We estimated incidence, prevalence, death, and disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) counts and age-standardised rates per 100 000 people per year for overall stroke, ischaemic stroke, intracerebral haemorrhage, and subarachnoid haemorrhage, for 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2021. We also calculated burden of stroke attributable to 23 risk factors and six risk clusters (air pollution, tobacco smoking, behavioural, dietary, environmental, and metabolic risks) at the global and regional levels (21 GBD regions and Socio-demographic Index [SDI] quintiles), using the standard GBD methodology. 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) for each individual future estimate were derived from the 2·5th and 97·5th percentiles of distributions generated from propagating 500 draws through the multistage computational pipeline. In 2021, stroke was the third most common GBD level 3 cause of death (7·3 million [95% UI 6·6-7·8] deaths; 10·7% [9·8-11·3] of all deaths) after ischaemic heart disease and COVID-19, and the fourth most common cause of DALYs (160·5 million [147·8-171·6] DALYs; 5·6% [5·0-6·1] of all DALYs). In 2021, there were 93·8 million (89·0-99·3) prevalent and 11·9 million (10·7-13·2) incident strokes. We found disparities in stroke burden and risk factors by GBD region, country or territory, and SDI, as well as a stagnation in the reduction of incidence from 2015 onwards, and even some increases in the stroke incidence, death, prevalence, and DALY rates in southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania, countries with lower SDI, and people younger than 70 years. Globally, ischaemic stroke constituted 65·3% (62·4-67·7), intracerebral haemorrhage constituted 28·8% (28·3-28·8), and subarachnoid haemorrhage constituted 5·8% (5·7-6·0) of incident strokes. There were substantial increases in DALYs attributable to high BMI (88·2% [53·4-117·7]), high ambient temperature (72·4% [51·1 to 179·5]), high fasting plasma glucose (32·1% [26·7-38·1]), diet high in sugar-sweetened beverages (23·4% [12·7-35·7]), low physical activity (11·3% [1·8-34·9]), high systolic blood pressure (6·7% [2·5-11·6]), lead exposure (6·5% [4·5-11·2]), and diet low in omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (5·3% [0·5-10·5]). Stroke burden has increased from 1990 to 2021, and the contribution of several risk factors has also increased. Effective, accessible, and affordable measures to improve stroke surveillance, prevention (with the emphasis on blood pressure, lifestyle, and environmental factors), acute care, and rehabilitation need to be urgently implemented across all countries to reduce stroke burden.

    "abstract": "The effect of dietary macronutrient balance on longevity and metabolic health remains a subject of considerable interest. We aimed to investigate the association of carbohydrate-to-protein and carbohydrate-to-fat ratios with all-cause and cardiovascular mortalities. In this population-based study, data from the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study were integrated with those from national data sources, including mortality records from the Korea National Statistical Office. The primary outcomes were all-cause and cardiovascular mortalities. Carbohydrate-to-protein and carbohydrate-to-fat ratios were evaluated based on dietary habits assessed through a food frequency questionnaire. Harrell's C-index was employed to determine optimal cut-off points for carbohydrate-to-protein and carbohydrate-to-fat ratios. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to assess associations. A total of 143,050 participants aged ≥40 years were included in the analyses. Compared with individuals with non-elevated carbohydrate-to-protein ratios (<5.2), those with elevated carbohydrate-to-protein ratios (>9.9) exhibited a higher all-cause mortality (hazard ratio 1.09, 95% confidence interval 1.01-1.17); however, no correlation between carbohydrate-to-protein ratio and cardiovascular mortality (hazard ratio 1.13, 95% confidence interval 0.96-1.32) was observed. Compared with those with non-elevated carbohydrate-to-fat ratios (<5.1), those with higher carbohydrate-to-fat ratios (>7.1) exhibited increased all-cause (hazard ratio 1.08, 95% confidence interval 1.00-1.16) and cardiovascular (hazard ratio 1.27, 95% confidence interval 1.06-1.52) mortalities. Our findings regarding macronutrient ratios and their association with mortality suggest that reducing excessive carbohydrate intake and increasing the consumption of protein and fats may have beneficial effects on longevity and cardiovascular health. Further studies are needed to understand the underlying mechanisms of these effects.",

    "abstract": "The obesity prevalence in South Korea in 2021 stood at 38.4%. South Korea faces unique challenges in providing essential and emergency guidelines for weight management because of stepping into an aging society. We aimed to determine the daily diet patterns among the general Korean population and to investigate the association between such patterns and different obesity. Longitudinal prospective cohort study. A total of 6539 adult participants (mean age 50.8 years, 52.9% male) with normal-weight adults were included from the Ansan-Ansung cohort of 10,030 Korean adults aged 40 or older and followed for an average of 11 years. Obesity was defined according to the criteria from the Korean Society for The Study of Obesity. Baseline dietary intake was assessed using a validated 103-item food frequency questionnaire. Dietary patterns were derived from k-means cluster analysis. In the multivariate analysis, referring to white rice + baechu kimchi, participants from multigrain rice + baechu kimchi showed lower HR for obesity development (waist circumference defined-obesity; HR: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.79, 0.95; body fat percentage defined-obesity; HR: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.80, 0.98). Further analysis documented that except for body fat percentage defined-obesity, consuming milk or dairy products was linked to a reduced incidence of the other three obesity (body mass index defined-obesity; HR: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.72, 0.99; waist circumference defined-obesity; HR: 0.82, 95% CI: 0.71, 0.94; waist-to-hip ratio defined-obesity; HR: 0.75, 95% CI: 0.61, 0.91). Following a diet that includes multigrain rice, fermented baechu kimchi, and dairy products is linked to a decreased risk of obesity in Korean adults. Public health programs and policies could incorporate these dietary recommendations, targeting specific population groups such as schoolchildren, adults, and the elderly. Additionally, further research is needed to explore the synergistic effects of various foods and their interactions within dietary patterns on obesity outcomes.",

    "abstract": "The prevalence of obesity has increased worldwide over the past decades. Regional variations exist in the relationship between body mass index (BMI), body fat, and health risks: Asians typically have a lower BMI than people of European descent, but a higher risk of obesity-related comorbidities. However, there is a paucity of evidence for anti-obesity medications (AOMs) in East Asian populations. In this study, we aimed to systematically review evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of AOMs among adults with obesity disease in East Asia, and to assess the feasibility of conducting an indirect treatment comparison (ITC) between the semaglutide and mazindol trials. The Embase, MEDLINE, and ICHUSHI databases were searched via the Ovid SP platform for randomized controlled trials, in English or Japanese, reporting data on semaglutide or mazindol therapy with placebo or diet and exercise as comparators. The potential risks of bias in conducting a population-adjusted ITC were determined based on the heterogeneity of potential effect modifiers and variations in study design. Of 21 publications, 2 were included in this study based on the eligibility criteria. The STEP 6 study established the clinical efficacy of subcutaneous semaglutide compared with placebo in the reduction of body weight and cardiometabolic risk factors [glycated hemoglobin (HbA Semaglutide and mazindol are associated with significant body weight reduction among people with obesity in East Asia.

    "title": "Eating Habits and Lifestyle Factors Related to Childhood Obesity Among Children Aged 5-6 Years: Cluster Analysis of Panel Survey Data in Korea.",
    "abstract": "Childhood obesity has emerged as a major health issue due to the rapid growth in the prevalence of obesity among young children worldwide. Establishing healthy eating habits and lifestyles in early childhood may help children gain appropriate weight and further improve their health outcomes later in life. This study aims to classify clusters of young children according to their eating habits and identify the features of each cluster as they relate to childhood obesity. A total of 1280 children were selected from the Panel Study on Korean Children. Data on their eating habits (eating speed, mealtime regularity, consistency of food amount, and balanced eating), sleep hours per day, outdoor activity hours per day, and BMI were obtained. We performed a cluster analysis on the children's eating habits using k-means methods. We conducted ANOVA and chi-square analyses to identify differences in the children's BMI, sleep hours, physical activity, and the characteristics of their parents and family by cluster. At both ages (ages 5 and 6 years), we identified 4 clusters based on the children's eating habits. Cluster 1 was characterized by a fast eating speed (fast eaters); cluster 2 by a slow eating speed (slow eaters); cluster 3 by irregular eating habits (poor eaters); and cluster 4 by a balanced diet, regular mealtimes, and consistent food amounts (healthy eaters). Slow eaters tended to have the lowest BMI (P<.001), and a low proportion had overweight and obesity at the age of 5 years (P=.03) and 1 year later (P=.005). There was a significant difference in sleep time (P=.01) and mother's education level (P=.03) at the age of 5 years. Moreover, there was a significant difference in sleep time (P=.03) and the father's education level (P=.02) at the age of 6 years. Efforts to establish healthy eating habits in early childhood may contribute to the prevention of obesity in children. Specifically, providing dietary guidance on a child's eating speed can help prevent childhood obesity. This research suggests that lifestyle modification could be a viable target to decrease the risk of childhood obesity and promote the development of healthy children. Additionally, we propose that future studies examine long-term changes in obesity resulting from lifestyle modifications in children from families with low educational levels.",

Thirty-two patients were randomized into two groups: sixteen received SFD and sixteen received SBD. Anthropometric, laboratory evaluations were conducted upon admission and discharge. Patients filled out questionnaires on demographics, diet satisfaction, food intake amount, and health-related QOL on the day of discharge, assessed using the EuroQoL 5 Dimensions 3 Level and EuroQoL Visual Analogue Scale (EQ-VAS) instruments. Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics,  The SBD group had higher dietary intake (63.2% vs. 51.0%) and greater diet satisfaction (80.6 vs. 48.1,  While SFD is often recommended after OMF surgery to protect oral wound healing process, our study reveals that SBD not only enhances physical and psychological outcomes but also, somewhat unexpectedly, supports wound healing and reduces complications.

    "abstract": "Our study harnesses the power of natural language processing (NLP) to explore the relationship between dietary patterns and metabolic health outcomes among Korean adults using data from the Seventh Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES VII). Using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) analysis, we identified three distinct dietary patterns: \"Traditional and Staple\", \"Communal and Festive\", and \"Westernized and Convenience-Oriented\". These patterns reflect the diversity of dietary preferences in Korea and reveal the cultural and social dimensions influencing eating habits and their potential implications for public health, particularly concerning obesity and metabolic disorders. Integrating NLP-based indices, including sentiment scores and the identified dietary patterns, into our predictive models significantly enhanced the accuracy of obesity and dyslipidemia predictions. This improvement was consistent across various machine learning techniques-XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost-demonstrating the efficacy of NLP methodologies in refining disease prediction models. Our findings underscore the critical role of dietary patterns as indicators of metabolic diseases. The successful application of NLP techniques offers a novel approach to public health and nutritional epidemiology, providing a deeper understanding of the diet-disease nexus. This study contributes to the evolving field of personalized nutrition and emphasizes the potential of leveraging advanced computational tools to inform targeted nutritional interventions and public health strategies aimed at mitigating the prevalence of metabolic disorders in the Korean population.",

    "abstract": "The composition and balance of macronutrient intake play key roles in promoting a longer lifespan. In this study, we aimed to investigate the secular trends in carbohydrate, fat, and protein intakes in South Koreans from 2010 to 2020. We examined the dietary nutritional intake of South Koreans using data from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. A total of 60,190 adults aged ≥19 y who completed the 24-h dietary recall interviews in a single day on all survey periods were included in this study. The outcomes included changes in macronutrient intake according to subgroups, such as age; sex; and the presence of diabetes, dyslipidemia, stroke, or heart disease, as well as energy intake from macronutrients. The study population showed a significant decrease in total energy intake from 2010 to 2020, with a corresponding decrease in the percentage of energy intake from carbohydrates (p-values for trend < 0.001). Conversely, the proportions of energy intake from proteins and fats increased during the same period (p < 0.001). Subgroup analyses revealed variations in macronutrient intake trends according to age, sex, obesity status, and underlying diseases. The analysis of trends in energy intake from various fat subtypes, total sugar, and fiber revealed a decrease in the energy intake percentage of total sugar from 2016 to 2020 and an increase in the energy intake percentage of all fat subtypes and fiber from 2013 to 2020. In the past 10 y, the dietary patterns in Korea have shifted toward the consumption of high-fat and high-protein diets with reduced carbohydrate intake.",

    "abstract": "Data on the benefits of the once weekly GLP-1 receptor agonist semaglutide 2·4 mg for weight management in people from east Asia are insufficient. The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy and safety of once weekly semaglutide 2·4 mg versus placebo for weight management in a predominantly east Asian adult population. This randomised phase 3a, double-blind multicentre controlled trial (STEP 7) recruited participants from 23 hospitals and trial centres in China, Hong Kong, Brazil, and South Korea. Adults with overweight or obesity, with or without type 2 diabetes, were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive a subcutaneous injection of either semaglutide 2·4 mg or placebo once a week for 44 weeks, plus a diet and physical activity intervention. Randomisation was done in blocks of six with an interactive web response system and was stratified by diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. Participants, investigators, and the trial sponsor were masked to treatment allocation until after database lock. Primary endpoints were percentage change in mean bodyweight and proportion of participants having reached a weight reduction of at least 5% of bodyweight from baseline to week 44. Safety was assessed in all participants who received at least one dose of study drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04251156, and is now complete. From Dec 8, 2020, to Aug 23, 2022, 448 participants were screened, of whom 375 were randomly assigned to either the semaglutide 2·4 mg group (n=249) or the placebo group (n=126). Estimated mean percentage change in bodyweight from baseline to week 44 was -12·1% (SE 0·5) with semaglutide 2·4 mg versus -3·6% (0·7) with placebo (estimated treatment difference -8·5 percentage points [95% CI -10·2 to -6·8]; p<0·0001). At week 44, the proportion of participants who lost 5% or more of their bodyweight was higher in the semaglutide 2·4 mg group than in the placebo group (203/238 [85%] vs 36/116 [31%]); odds ratio 13·1 (95% CI 7·4-23·1; p<0·0001). Adverse events were reported by 231 (93%) of 249 participants in the semaglutide 2·4 mg group and 108 (86%) of 126 participants in the placebo group, the most common of which were gastrointestinal disorders (168/249, 67% vs 45/126, 36%).

Stunting imitates chronic undernutrition throughout the most extreme critical stages of growth and development of a child in their early life, and due to that stunted child does not completely develop and are too short for their age. Stunting is mainly linked with brain underdevelopment, along with lifelong damaging consequences, comprising weakened mental and learning capacity, deprived performance in school during childhood, and enhanced risks of nutrition linked to chronic long-lasting ailments, such as diabetes, hypertension, diabesity, and obesity in the future. In this review, the authors mainly summarize the latest studies related to chronic nutrition and how it is related to stunting. Optimal nutrition, particularly during pregnancy and the first 24 months of a child's life, is crucial in preventing stunting. Circadian rhythms play a significant role in maternal and fetal health, affecting outcomes such as premature birth and stunting. Maintaining a balanced diet, avoiding late-night carbohydrate-heavy meals during pregnancy, and promoting breastfeeding align with the body's biological clock, which can benefit newborns in various ways. Providing dedicated spaces for breastfeeding in public places is important to support infant health.",

    "title": "Sex differences in cardiovascular risk factors and quality of life among individuals with hypertension in Korea from 2013 to 2018: A cross-sectional cohort study.",
    "abstract": "As its prevalence increases and its association with cardiovascular disease and mortality is established, there is a need to improve prevention and management strategies for hypertension. Therefore, we aimed to compare differences in cardiovascular health status between men and women with hypertension defined by systolic blood pressure ≥140 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mmHg, and/or treatment with antihypertensive drugs. The association between cardiovascular health status and health-related quality of life was also evaluated. Additionally, a secondary analysis was performed on the cross-sectional data from 7306 adults with hypertension, ≥40 years of age between 2013 and 2018. Of this sample, 51.2% of patients were women from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The seven Cardiovascular Health Metrics were used to quantify cardiovascular health status and the 5-dimensional European Quality of Life Questionnaire (EQ-5D) was used to evaluate health-related quality of life. A higher proportion of men than that of women was observed in the poor cardiovascular health score group [total score 0-7], with a higher proportion of women in the intermediate group [total score 8-10] and ideal group [total 11-14] (p<0.0001). The proportion of women in the EQ-5D index was higher than that of men in the poor and intermediate groups (p<0.0001), with no difference in the proportion of men and women in the ideal group (p = 0.1452). Furthermore, specific cardiovascular risk factors were different between men and women: women had lower physical activity level and higher prevalence of high cholesterol (≥200 mg/dl), and men had higher body mass indices and worse diet management. These findings indicate that prevention and management strategies for hypertension and cardiovascular health might need to differ for men and women to improve outcomes.",

    "abstract": "While the relationship between impaired kidney function and non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) is well established, there is limited research exploring the association between an elevated estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and the efficacy of NOACs, especially concerning the outcomes of acute ischemic stroke (AIS). This study aimed to examine the association between higher-than-normal eGFR and the severity of AIS during the use of NOACs using a nationwide multicenter stroke registry in Korea. This study utilized data from the Korean Stroke Registry (KSR) database, examining information from 2,379 patients with AIS, who had atrial fibrillation (AF) and a history of utilizing NOACs prior to hospitalization due to incident stroke occurring between 2016 and 2021. Patients with a history involving two or more types of anticoagulants or one or more forms of antiplatelet agents were excluded. Baseline characteristics, medical history, medication usage, CHADS The mean age of subjects was 76.1 ± 8.9 years.

    "abstract": "Cancer is a major health burden in Korea, and dietary factors have been suggested as putative risk factors for cancer development at various sites. This study systematically reviewed the published literature investigating the associations between dietary factors and cancer incidence among Korean adults, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta- Analyses guidelines. We focused on the 5 most studied cancer sites (stomach, colorectum, breast, thyroid, and cervix) as outcomes and dietary exposures with evidence levels greater than limited-suggestive according to the World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research (WCRF/AICR) panel's judgment for any of the cancer sites. This resulted in the inclusion of 72 studies. Pooled estimates of the impact of dietary factors on cancer risk suggested protective associations of fruits and vegetables with risks for gastric cancer (GC), colorectal cancer (CRC), and breast cancer (BC) and dietary vitamin C with the risk of GC, as well as a harmful association between fermented soy products and the risk of GC. Despite the limited number of studies, we observed consistent protective associations of dietary fiber with GC and dietary fiber, coffee, and calcium with CRC. These findings are largely consistent with the WCRF/AICR expert report. However, pooled estimates for the associations of other salt-preserved foods with GC, meat with CRC, and dietary carotenoids and dairy products with BC did not reach statistical significance. Further studies with prospective designs, larger sample sizes, and diverse types of dietary factors and cancer sites are necessary.",

    "abstract": "Cholesterol plays important roles in β-amyloid (Aβ) metabolism and atherosclerosis. However, the relationships of plasma cholesterol levels with Aβ and cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) burdens are not fully understood in Asians. Herein, we investigated the relationships between plasma cholesterol profile components and Aβ and CSVD burdens in a large, non-demented Korean cohort. We enrolled 1,175 non-demented participants (456 with unimpaired cognition [CU] and 719 with mild cognitive impairment [MCI]) aged ≥ 45 years who underwent Aβ PET at the Samsung Medical Center in Korea. We performed linear regression analyses with each cholesterol (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-c], high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-c], and triglyceride) level as a predictor and each image marker (Aβ uptake on PET, white matter hyperintensity [WMH] volume, and hippocampal volume) as an outcome after controlling for potential confounders. Increased LDL-c levels (β = 0.014 to 0.115, p = 0.013) were associated with greater Aβ uptake, independent of the APOE e4 allele genotype and lipid-lowering medication. Decreased HDL-c levels (β =  - 0.133 to - 0.006, p = 0.032) were predictive of higher WMH volumes. Increased LDL-c levels were also associated with decreased hippocampal volume (direct effect β =  - 0.053, p = 0.040), which was partially mediated by Aβ uptake (indirect effect β =  - 0.018, p = 0.006). Our findings highlight that increased LDL-c and decreased HDL-c levels are important risk factors for Aβ and CSVD burdens, respectively. Furthermore, considering that plasma cholesterol profile components are potentially modified by diet, exercise, and pharmacological agents, our results provide evidence that regulating LDL-c and HDL-c levels is a potential strategy to prevent dementia.",

    "abstract": "The health-beneficial outcomes of doenjang, a Korean fermented food have been questioned due to its high salt content; moreover, the detailed underlying mechanisms of its health beneficial effects are not fully investigated. Thus, this study aimed to investigate doenjang's anti-obesity effects, anti-hypertensive effects, and its underlying mechanisms in high-fat diet -induced obesity. Sprague-Dawley rats fed with normal diet (ND), high-fat diet (HD), HD with 8% additive salt (HDS), or HD with doenjang containing 8% salt (HDJ) for 13 weeks. Compared to HD and HDS groups, the HDJ group had lower body and epididymal fat tissue weight gain and showed hypotrophy and hypoplasia. The RAS-related mRNA levels in the adipose tissue, including Renin and Ace were downregulated in the HDJ group compared to HD and HDS groups. Additionally, HDJ groups had significant improvements in systolic blood pressure, serum RAS-associated parameters (e.g., angiotensin II and aldosterone), renal mRNA levels related to RAS (e.g., angiotensin II receptor type 1 and 2), and aldosterone-associated mRNA expressions (e.g., mineralocorticoid receptor) in the kidney of HD-induced obese rats. Most importantly, HDS and HDJ groups showed distinct outcomes regarding adipogenesis and electrolytes metabolism, even though both diets contain a high level of salt. HDS group showed a higher epididymal fat tissue weight, mass, and adipocyte size than HDJ group. In addition, compared with HDJ group, HDS group significantly decreased the release of Na+ and K+ throughout the urine and feces. The present study addresses that doenjang has anti-obesity effects and anti-hypertensive effects by activating RAS in the adipose tissue and kidney, respectively. Additionally, this study also demonstrates that salt in doenjang and the additive salt differently influences adipogenesis and electrolytes metabolism, supporting doenjang has health advantageous effects regardless of its high salt contents.",

    "abstract": "Few studies have provided evidence of the association between diet quality and dental caries. This study aimed to examine the association between diet quality and untreated dental caries in a Korean representative population. The study population included a sample of 13,815 participants, aged ≥ 19 from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey during 2013-2015. The explanatory variable was diet quality and the outcome variable was untreated dental caries. Untreated dental caries were defined by the number of decayed teeth recorded according to the criteria established by the World Health Organization. Diet quality was defined by using the Korean Healthy Eating Index (KHEI) through the 24-h recall methods. We assessed the association between diet quality and untreated dental caries while adjusting for age, sex, education, income, smoking status, dental visits, toothbrushing frequencies, obesity, and diabetes mellitus. The mean overall KHEI scores in the untreated dental caries group were significantly lower than those in the group without untreated dental caries. Significant differences were observed in the untreated dental caries group based on the KHEI quartiles ( The findings indicated an inverse association between diet quality and untreated dental caries in Korean adults. Healthcare providers should take into account the significant role of diet quality in preventing and managing oral health.",

    "abstract": "Miracle fruit (MF) has emerged as a promising option for healthy noncaloric sweeteners due to its sour-to-sweet taste-modifying effects and high antioxidant activity. We aimed to examine the feasibility and acceptability of using MF as a weight-loss strategy for individuals with diabetes or prediabetes. Fifty Korean-American men and women (25 participants each) aged 45-75 years with diabetes or prediabetes were recruited in this study. They participated in a randomized placebo-controlled crossover trial where they took the assigned tablet (either an MF tablet or a placebo-sugar candy) 10 min before consuming food. Using a 9-point hedonic scale, participants assessed the likings of overall, flavor, texture, and aftertaste for green apples, goat cheese, lemonade, pickles, and plain fat-free yogurt before and 10 min after taking the assigned tablet. Additionally, overall liking for meals and calorie intake were assessed during subsequent ad libitum meal sessions. An ANOVA for a crossover design, and independent and paired t-tests were used to compare the outcomes. The results revealed that all postintervention liking values for sour-tasting foods were higher than the respective preintervention liking values for both interventions. However, the MF intervention showed significantly higher pre-post differences in liking for all sour-tasting foods and the overall liking values for breakfast and dinner compared to the placebo intervention (P < 0.001). Furthermore, the MF intervention resulted in a significantly lower calorie intake for each meal than the placebo (P < 0.001). These findings suggest that MF intervention can be considered a viable weight-loss strategy for individuals with diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Dyslipidemia is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and appropriate intake of amino acids may be helpful for the management of dyslipidemia. However, evidence of an association between amino acid intake and dyslipidemia in Korean adults is limited. The purpose of this study was to investigate how the incidence of dyslipidemia in Korean adults is associated with the consumption of amino acids, essential and nonessential types, as well as the sources of these amino acids from food. Data from 35,478 study participants without dyslipidemia at baseline from the Ansan and Ansung Study and the Health Examinee Study were used for the analysis. Dyslipidemia and its components such as hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, hyper-low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterolemia and hypo-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterolemia were the main outcome in this study. The participants were categorized into quartiles, based on the intake of amino acids and plant-/animal-based proteins. On average, the follow-up period lasted for 5.7 years. The two major food groups that contributed to one-half of the intake for each type of amino acid were whole grain mixed rice and white rice. Compared to the lowest quartile group, the highest quartile groups of essential amino acid intake [men: hazard ratio (HR) = 0.78; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.63-0.97;  To conclude, the intake of amino acids may have a protective effect against dyslipidemia in Korean adults who are aged 40 years or older, regardless of their protein food sources.",

This study uses three representative prospective cohorts in Korea and 134,586 eligible participants are selected. Food intake is assessed using a food frequency questionnaire. Outcomes are classified as death from cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, and all-causes. Red meat intake shows a marginally negative association with all-cause mortality in the median intake group and a positive association in the highest intake group. Processed meat intake in the highest quintile group is positively associated with all-cause mortality compared to that of the lowest quintile group. Fish intake in the highest quintile group is negatively associated with CVD mortality in men, and all-cause mortality in women, compared to those in the lowest quintile group, while processed fish intake has unfavorable effects on mortality. In addition, substitution of one serving per week of red and processed meat, and processed fish with fish is negatively associated with all-cause and CVD mortality. Reduction of red and processed meat, and processed fish consumption or replacement of these foods with fish may be beneficial for longevity in Korean adults.",

    "abstract": "Air pollution, especially particulate matter (PM), is one of the major public health risk factors. More than 91% of the global population lives in areas where air pollution exceeds the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended limits. WHO estimated that air pollution is responsible for approximately 4.2 million deaths every year. PM has serious effects on health outcomes (especially in respiratory and cardiovascular diseases and all-cause morbidity). However, there are few intervention studies on the reduction of PM-exposure related health effects. Currently, air purifiers, masks, behavior and other interventions, diet and medications are the recommended interventions for reducing the effect of PM on health; however, scientific evidence for the effects of these interventions are lacking. Here, we review the intervention studies on PM and aim to identify the recent research trends. Using air purifiers significantly lowered the concentration of PM, resulting in a decrease in inflammation and blood pressure. Similarly, wearing a mask showed changes in lung function and blood pressure; however, there was no remarkable changes in the effects on the cardiovascular system. Therefore, intervention studies are limited and more research is needed. 대기오염, 특히 미세먼지는 공중보건의 주요 위험인자 중 하나이다. 전세계 인구의 91% 이상이 세계보건기구(World Health Organization, WHO)의 연간 평균 대기오염 제한 기준을 초과하는 지역에서 거주한다. 또한, WHO는 대기오염으로 인해 매년 420만 명이 사망하는 것으로 추정하였다. 미세먼지가 건강에 심각한 영향을 미친다는 연구결과는 꾸준히 보고되고 있다. 특히 호흡기 및 심혈관계 질환의 발생뿐만 아니라, 사망률의 증가와는 밀접한 관련성을 보인다. 반면 미세먼지 노출로 인한 건강피해를 저감하는 중재연구는 많지 않다. 현재 미세먼지 건강피해 저감을 위한 방안으로 공기청정기, 마스크, 행동 및 기타 중재, 식이 및 약물 등이 권고되고 있으나, 그 중재효과에 대한 과학적 근거는 부족한 상태이다. 이 글에서는 미세먼지 중재방안을 전반적으로 고찰하고, 최신 연구동향을 파악하고자 하였다. 그 결과, 공기청정기 사용 시 미세먼지 농도가 뚜렷한 감소를 보이고, 그로 인한 염증 수치 및 혈압 감소를 보였다. 마찬가지로, 마스크 착용 시 폐 기능 변화 및 혈압 감소를 보였으나, 심혈관계 영향은 뚜렷한 변화를 보이지 못했다. 따라서, 중재연구가 제한적으로 시행되고 있어 더 많은 연구가 필요하다.",

    "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease has an enormous impact on public health, medical systems, economies, and social conditions. Biologic therapy has ameliorated the treatment and clinical course of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The efficacy and safety profiles of currently available therapies are still less that optimal in numerous ways, highlighting the requirement for new therapeutic targets. A bunch of new drug studies are underway in inflammatory bowel disease with promising results. This is an outlined guideline of clinical diagnosis and pharmaceutical therapy of inflammatory bowel disease. Outline delineates the overall recommendations on the modern principles of desirable practice to bolster the adoption of best implementations and exploration as well as inflammatory bowel disease patient, gastroenterologist, and other healthcare provider education. Inflammatory bowel disease encompasses Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, the two unsolved medical inflammatory bowel disease-subtypes condition with no drug for cure. The signs and symptoms on first presentation relate to the anatomical localization and severity of the disease and less with the resulting diagnosis that can clinically and histologically be non-definitive to interpret and establish criteria, specifically in colonic inflammatory bowel disease when the establishment is inconclusive is classified as indeterminate colitis. Conservative pharmaceuticals and accessible avenues do not depend on the disease phenotype. The first line management is to manage symptoms and stabilize active disease; at the same time maintenance therapy is indicated. Nutrition and diet do not play a primary therapeutic role but is warranted as supportive care. There is need of special guideline that explore solution of groundwork gap in terms of access limitations to inflammatory bowel disease care, particularly in developing countries and the irregular representation of socioeconomic stratification with a strategic plan, for the unanswered questions and perspective for the future, especially during the surfaced global COVID-19 pandemic caused by coronavirus SARS-CoV2 impacting on both the patient's psychological functioning and endoscopy services. Establishment of a global registry system and accumulated experiences have led to consensus for inflammatory bowel disease management under the COVID-19 pandemic. Painstakingly, the pandemic has influenced medical care systems for these patients. I briefly herein viewpoint summarize among other updates the telemedicine roles during the pandemic and how operationally inflammatory bowel disease centers managed patients and ensured quality of care. In conclusion: inflammatory bowel disease has become a global emergent disease. Serious medical errors are public health problem observed in developing nations i.e., to distinguish inflammatory bowel disease and infectious and parasitic diseases. Refractory inflammatory bowel disease is a still significant challenge in the management of patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. There are gaps in knowledge and future research directions on the recent newly registered pharmaceuticals.

The Committee for Clinical Practice Guidelines comprised individuals with multidisciplinary expertise in obesity management. A steering board of seven experts oversaw the entire project. Recommendations were developed as the answers to key questions formulated in patient/problem, intervention, comparison, outcomes (PICO) format. Guidelines underwent multi-level review and cross-checking and received endorsement from relevant scientific societies. This edition of the guidelines includes criteria for diagnosing obesity, abdominal obesity, and metabolic syndrome; evaluation of obesity and its complications; weight loss goals; and treatment options such as diet, exercise, behavioral therapy, pharmacotherapy, and bariatric and metabolic surgery for Korean people with obesity. Compared to the previous edition of the guidelines, the current edition includes five new topics to keep up with the constantly evolving field of obesity: diagnosis of obesity, obesity in women, obesity in patients with mental illness, weight maintenance after weight loss, and the use of information and communication technology-based interventions for obesity treatment. This edition of the guidelines features has improved organization, more clearly linking key questions in PICO format to recommendations and key references. We are confident that these new Clinical Practice Guidelines for Obesity will be a valuable resource for all healthcare professionals as they describe the most current and evidence-based treatment options for obesity in a well-organized format.",

    "title": "The effect of nurse-led digital health interventions on blood pressure control for people with hypertension: A systematic review and meta-analysis.",
    "abstract": "Nurse-led digital health interventions (DHIs) for people with chronic disease are increasing. However, the effect of nurse-led DHIs on blood pressure control and hypertension self-management remains unclear. This study aimed to identify the characteristics of nurse-led DHIs for people with hypertension and compared the effect size of nurse-led DHIs with that of usual care to establish evidence for the development of effective nursing interventions using technologies. Systematic review and meta-analysis. This systematic review and meta-analysis followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews of Intervention (PRISMA) guidelines and registered the protocol in PROSPERO. Studies published from 2000 to August 5, 2021, were searched using the international databases: PubMed; Embase; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; Web of Science; CINAHL; Korean databases: RISS, KISS, KMBASE; and NDSL. Risk of bias 2.0 was used for evaluating the quality of studies. The primary outcome was blood pressure control. The secondary outcomes were self-management, medication adherence, and diet adherence. Publication bias was assessed using the funnel plot and Egger's regression tests. The systematic review included 26 studies. A meta-analysis of 21 studies was conducted to calculate the effect size and identify heterogeneity among the included studies. In our meta-analysis, we observed that nurse-led DHIs reduced systolic blood pressure by 6.49 mmHg (95% confidence interval [CI]: -8.52 to -4.46, I Nurse-led DHIs were more effective in reducing blood pressure and enhancing self-management than usual care among people with hypertension. Therefore, as new technologies are being rapidly developed and applied in healthcare systems, further studies and policy support are needed to utilize the latest digital innovations with nursing interventions. This study could be used to identify that nurse-led interventions may take advantage of real-time communication by employing digital technologies for improving blood control and self-management behaviors such as medication adherence and diet adherence. Using nurse-led DHIs allows nurses to provide patient-centered interventions such as reflecting on patients' needs and shared decision-making without space constraints and limited treatment time.",

    "abstract": "Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are well known to elicit health benefits in humans, but their functional metabolic landscapes remain unexplored. Here, we analyze differences in growth, intestinal persistence, and postbiotic biosynthesis of six representative LAB and their interactions with 15 gut bacteria under 11 dietary regimes by combining multi-omics and in silico modeling. We confirmed predictions on short-term persistence of LAB and their interactions with commensals using cecal microbiome abundance and spent-medium experiments. Our analyses indicate that probiotic attributes are both diet and species specific and cannot be solely explained using genomics. For example, although both Lacticaseibacillus casei and Lactiplantibacillus plantarum encode similarly sized genomes with diverse capabilities, L. casei exhibits a more desirable phenotype. In addition, \"high-fat/low-carb\" diets more likely lead to detrimental outcomes for most LAB. Collectively, our results highlight that probiotics are not \"one size fits all\" health supplements and lay the foundation for personalized probiotic design.",

    "abstract": "Emerging evidence links several health outcomes to the consumption of ultra-processed food (UPF), but few studies have investigated the association between UPF intake and kidney function. This cross-sectional study investigated the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in relation to UPF intake in Korea. Data were obtained from the 2004−2013 Health Examinees (HEXA) study. The intake of UPF was assessed using a 106-item food frequency questionnaire and evaluated using the NOVA classification. The prevalence of CKD was defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of <60 mL/min/m2. Poisson regression models were used to compute the prevalence ratios (PR) of CKD according to quartiles of the proportion of UPF intake (% food weight). A total of 134,544 (66.4% women) with a mean age of 52.0 years and an eGFR of 92.7 mL/min/m2 were analysed. The median proportion of UPF in the diet was 5.6%. After adjusting for potential confounders, the highest quartile of UPF intake was associated with the highest prevalence of CKD (PR 1.16, 95% CI 1.07−1.25), and every IQR (6.6%) increase in the proportion of UPF in the diet was associated with a 6% higher prevalence of CKD (PR 1.06, 95% CI 1.03−1.09). Furthermore, the highest consumption of UPF was inversely associated with eGFR (Q4 vs. Q1: β −1.07, 95% CI −1.35, −0.79; per IQR increment: (β −0.45, 95% CI −0.58, −0.32). The intake of UPF was associated with a high prevalence of CKD and a reduced eGFR. Longitudinal studies in the Korean population are needed to corroborate existing findings in other populations.",

    "abstract": "Multidomain lifestyle modification is considered an effective intervention for dementia prevention due to its multifactorial nature. Recognizing that participants' activity adherence is crucial for successful lifestyle modification, our team developed a smartphone application to enhance motivation toward brain health behavior based on gamification theory, which influences behaviors by enhancing motivation. The developed smartphone application has two main functions: delivering supporting videos from family, friends, and medical staff, and self-evaluation. We assessed the effectiveness of this smartphone application with regard to brain health behavior. In this eight-week randomized controlled trial, 40 participants were randomly assigned to the smartphone application intervention group or control group. The primary outcome reflected participants' brain health behavior in three categories: physical activity, cognitive activity, and healthy diet. Each brain health behavior was measured by the Korean version of the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire, Cognitive Activity Score, and Mediterranean DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay Diet Score. Furthermore, we investigated the change in motivation, measured by the Situational Motivation Scale. Additionally, we reviewed participants' self-record diary during the first, fourth, and eighth week of intervention for evaluation of adherence. The intervention group was found to have a positive association with moderate metabolic equivalent activities (P = 0.01) and intrinsic motivation change (P = 0.01). There was a significant difference between the intervention and control groups regarding average physical activity at week 8 (P = 0.037). An eight-week intervention with the smartphone application induced physical activity of moderate intensity through intrinsic motivation enhancement. We suggest that the motivation enhancement application could be an efficient option for maintaining and promoting psychosocial health behavior. This smartphone application can be applied to any other disease that needs behavioral change. Through the application, a broader spectrum of the population, regardless of time, space, and human resources, can benefit from community health services.

    "title": "Trends in Diet Quality and Cardiometabolic Risk Factors Among Korean Adults, 2007-2018.",
    "abstract": "Few studies have examined the dietary trends in Korea beyond evaluating selected food groups. To help prevent cardiometabolic disease burdens, a comprehensive investigation of the trends in overall diet quality and identification of possible contributing factors would be useful. To investigate the trends and independent associations of age, period, and birth cohort with diet quality and cardiometabolic risk factors among Korean adults. Serial cross-sectional and age-period-cohort analyses were conducted of nationally representative 24-hour dietary recall data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2007-2018. The study population included 65 416 Korean adults aged 19 to 79 years. Data analyses were conducted from March 1, 2020, through April 30, 2021. Age, calendar year, birth cohort, and population sociodemographic characteristics. Korean Healthy Eating Index (KHEI), a validated diet quality score (range, 0-90, with higher scores indicating greater diet quality), and 8 cardiometabolic risk factors (waist circumference and systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, serum total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglyceride, and fasting blood glucose levels). Among 65 416 participants, mean age (SD) was 44.5 (0.1) years and 36 631 were women (55.8%). In 2007-2018, the age-standardized mean (SE) KHEI score increased from 51.0 (0.4) to 52.1 (0.5), which was associated with reduced sodium intake and increased whole grain, dairy, and protein-rich food intakes. The mean (SE) KHEI score was lowest at age 39 years (50.1 [0.3]) and increased at older ages (58.0 [0.3] at 79 years). Controlling for age and period effects, the highest KHEI score was observed among the birth cohorts of 1960-1964 (53.6 [0.9]) and decreased in subsequent cohorts (45.5 [1.2] in the 1990-1999 birth cohort). Similar cohort effects in cardiometabolic risk factors were observed, showing the lowest waist circumference, blood pressure, and total cholesterol levels among the birth cohorts of the 1960s and 1970s and higher levels among more recent birth cohorts (1990-1999 vs 1960-1964: waist circumference, 83.8 [0.5] vs 81.4 [0.4] cm; systolic blood pressure, 118.7 [0.7] vs 116.4 [0.4] mm Hg; total cholesterol, 200.2 [0.9] vs 198.9 [0.7] mg/dL). At most ages, periods, and birth cohorts, the mean KHEI score was consistently higher in adults living in urban areas (at age 45 years: 50.5 [1.0] vs 49.7 [0.9] rural) and among high-income (at age 45 years: 50.7 [1.1] vs 49.3 [0.9] low income) and educational levels (at age 45 years: 53.1 [0.9] vs 49.1 [1.0] low educational level). The findings of this study suggest that, from 2007 to 2018, the diet quality of Korean adults modestly improved. Despite the improvement, inequalities in diet among age, birth cohort, and socioeconomic subgroups persisted, suggesting that more intense interventions may be needed to target the susceptible groups.",

    "abstract": "Previous research has suggested that poor oral health is positively associated with frailty. The objective of this study was to explore associations of key oral diseases (periodontal disease, tooth loss), and oral hygiene and management behaviors with the level of frailty in community-dwelling older Korean adults using national representative survey data. This study used cross-sectional, 6th and 7th Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES VI, VII) data. Adults aged 50+ years were included. Frailty was measured using frailty phenotype (FP) and frailty index (FI). FP was determined using five frailty criteria, i.e., weight loss, weakness, exhaustion, slowness, or low physical activity, and the level of frailty was classified with the number of criteria present (robust, none; pre-frail, 1-2; frail, 3+). FI was determined using a 44-item FI constructed according to a standard protocol, and the level of frailty was classified as robust (FI: ≤ 0.08), pre-frail (FI: 0.08-0.25), and frail (FI: ≥ 0.25). Multiple ordinal regression analyses were conducted with each type of frailty as the outcome variable. Independent variables of interest were the periodontal status, number of teeth, and practices on oral hygiene and management. Analyses were additionally adjusted for participants' socioeconomic, diet, and behavioral characteristics. The prevalence of frailty was 4.38% according to the FP classification (n = 4156), 10.74% according to the FI classification (n = 15,073). In the final adjusted model, having more teeth and brushing after all three meals were significantly associated with lower odds of being more frail (in both frailty models); no significant association was observed between periodontal disease and frailty. Findings from this study show having more teeth and practicing adequate brushing are significantly associated with frailty. Due to limitations of the study design, well-designed longitudinal studies are needed to confirm these findings.",

The participants were selected (1334 men and 2185 women) from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2016−2018 and categorized into single/multi-person households. The KHEI scores were calculated based on the 24 h recall data of dietary intake. Among both sexes, single-person households had significantly lower subjective health status scores (p = 0.015 for men; p < 0.001 for women), lower EuroQol-5D index scores (p = 0.011 for men; p = 0.003 for women), and higher Patient Health Questionnaire-9 index scores (p = 0.004 for men; p < 0.001 for women), compared to multi-person households. Men had a higher risk of depression in single-person households compared to multi-person households (OR, 3.5; 95% CI, 1.2−10.1). For women, the ORs for stress perception with the first tertile group of KHEI scores in single-person and multi-person households compared to the third tertile group were 3.5 (95% CI, 1.3−9.0) and 1.4 (95% CI, 1.0−1.8), respectively.

    "title": "Association between dietary and suicidal behaviors in adolescents in Korea based on the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (2015-2020).",
    "abstract": "This study explored the association between dietary and suicidal behaviors of Korean adolescents and investigated differences in this association in children of immigrant parents. The sample (n=368,138) was collected from the Korea Youth Risk Behavior Survey from 2015 to 2020. Participants who agreed to provide family information (n=313,689) were classified according to their parents' nationality. The study variables were 11 self-reported dietary behaviors, and their composite dietary behaviors (i.e., nutrient deprivation and unhealthy food consumption) that resulted from principal component analysis. The association between study variables and suicide-related outcomes (i.e., suicidal ideation, suicide planning, and suicide attempts) was analyzed by multiple logistic regression with adjustment for covariates. Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Participants who skipped key meals and foods were more likely to have attemped suicide (aOR [95% CI]: skipping breakfast ≥5 days/wk, 1.28 [1.21 to 1.35]; consuming fruits <1 times/wk: 1.42 [1.32 to 1.52]; consuming vegetables <1 times/wk: 1.72 [1.53 to 1.93]; consuming milk <3 times/wk: 1.07 [0.99 to 1.16]). The associations were prominent in third culture kids (TCKs) (aOR [95% CI]: 2.23 [1.61 to 3.09]; 2.32 [1.61 to 3.35]; 2.63 [1.50 to 4.60]; 1.69 [1.09 to 2.63], respectively). Participants who consumed unhealthy foods (fast food, caffeinated and sugary drinks) more frequently were more likely to have attempted suicide (aOR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.38 to 1.73). This association was also more prominent in TCKs (aOR, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.08 to 4.01). Our findings indicate a positive association between unfavorable dietary behaviors and outcomes related to suicide, and this association appears to be notable in adolescents with immigrant parents.",

    "title": "Lower Dietary Calcium Intake is Associated with a Higher Risk of Mortality in Korean Adults.",
    "abstract": "Calcium, one of the most abundant minerals in the human body, has a pivotal role in human physiology. However, only a few studies have examined the association of dietary calcium intake with mortality in a population with low calcium intake. The aim of this study was to examine the association of dietary calcium intake with risk of all-cause and cause-specific mortality among Korean adults with low calcium intake. This study was a prospective cohort study. The analysis was conducted using data from 44,327 eligible Korean adults aged 19 years and older who participated in the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2007-2015. Dietary calcium intake was assessed using 1-day 24-hour recall data. The main outcomes of this study were mortality from all causes, cancer, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, and all other causes combined. The outcome was ascertained through linkage to the death registry compiled by Statistics Korea with the use of the resident registration number. Weighted Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate the hazard ratios and 95% CIs of the all-cause and cause-specific mortality according to dietary calcium intake. During a mean follow-up of 7.28 person-years, 1,889 deaths were ascertained. After multivariable adjustment, the hazard ratios for all-cause mortality for the second quintile to the highest quintile of dietary calcium intake, respectively, compared with the first quintile were 0.86 (95% CI 0.73 to 1.00), 0.82 (95% CI 0.69 to 0.98), 0.85 (95% CI 0.69 to 1.03), and 0.78 (95% CI 0.64 to 0.96) (P for trend from the lowest to the highest quintile = .04). There were no statistically significant associations between dietary calcium intake and risk of mortality from cancer, cardiovascular, or respiratory disease. In this large prospective cohort study of Korean adults, lower dietary calcium intake was associated with a higher risk of all-cause mortality.",

    "abstract": "A traditional balanced Korean diet (K-diet) may improve energy, glucose, and lipid metabolism. To evaluate this, we conducted a randomized crossover clinical trial, involving participants aged 30-40 years, who were randomly assigned to two groups-a K-diet or westernized Korean control diet daily, with an estimated energy requirement (EER) of 1900 kcal. After a 4-week washout period, they switched the diet and followed it for 4 weeks. The carbohydrate, protein, and fat ratios based on energy intake were close to the target values for the K-diet (65:15:20) and control diet (60:15:25). The glycemic index of the control diet and the K-diet was 50.3 ± 3.6 and 68.1 ± 2.9, respectively, and daily cholesterol contents in the control diet and K-diet were 280 and 150 mg, respectively. Anthropometric and biochemical parameters involved in energy, glucose, and lipid metabolism were measured while plasma metabolites were determined using UPLC-QTOF-MS before and after the 4-week intervention. After the four-week intervention, both diets improved anthropometric and biochemical variables, but the K-diet significantly reduced them compared to the control diet. Serum total cholesterol, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride concentrations were significantly lower in the K-diet group than in the control diet group.

    "abstract": "Accumulating evidence shows that nut consumption beneficially affects health outcomes. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between the intake of nuts, focusing on their mineral contents, and the risk of hypertension in nationally representative samples in Korea. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 12,113 subjects (4762 men and 7351 women) aged 19-64 years using raw data from KNHANES 2016-2019. Daily intake of 20 nuts and 9 minerals from nuts was assessed using the 24-h recall method. The risk of hypertension according to the median mineral intake from nuts and nuts themselves was assessed using logistic regression analysis with adjustment for potential confounders. The average daily nut intake was 4.34 g for females and 3.78 g males. Among nut intake, chestnuts represented the highest value at 0.95 g/day, followed by peanuts (0.72 g/day), almonds (0.62 g/day), sesame seeds (0.62 g/day), perilla seeds (0.33 g/day), and walnuts (0.32 g/day). The daily intake of minerals from nuts was significantly higher in the nut-overmedian (OM) group than in the nut-undermedian (UM) group. Regarding mineral intake from nuts, each mineral-UM group showed higher odds of hypertension than the mineral-OM group in women, but not in men. After adjustment for potential confounders, an inverse association between nut consumption, including minerals obtained from nuts, and hypertension prevalence, especially in women, was observed. Based on our results, it is suggested that incorporation of nuts into a daily diet may yield beneficial effects and lower the risk of hypertension in adult Korean women.",

    "abstract": "Nutrients that support the desired growth and development of the fetus (i.e., micronutrients like folate, iron, and zinc) have been associated with birth outcomes, such as gestational age at delivery and birth weight. We characterized the maternal dietary patterns that explain the maximum variation in folate, iron, and zinc intakes in pregnant Korean women using reduced-rank regression (RRR) and investigated the association of these patterns with small-for-gestational-age (SGA) risk. A total of 1158 pregnant Korean women at 12-28 weeks of gestation and their newborns were recruited for the Mothers and Children's Environmental Health (MOCEH) study between 2006 and 2010. A semiquantitative FFQ was collected from the women, and RRR was used to derive their dietary patterns. Log-transformed maternal intakes of folate, iron, and zinc were selected as the intermediate response variables to extract dietary patterns. Infant birth outcome measurements were obtained from hospital records. Associations were assessed by logistic regression with adjustment for confounding factors. Three dietary patterns were identified. Pattern 1, characterized by high intakes of grains, green/yellow and light-colored vegetables, kimchi, legumes, fruits, meat, eggs, fish, seaweeds, tofu/soymilk, yogurt, and nuts, was associated with a lower risk of SGA in the highest quartile than in the lowest quartile (OR: 0.36; 95% CI: 0.14, 0.94). Especially, maternal dietary pattern 1 was negatively related to high-sensitivity C-reactive protein in the blood and malondialdehyde concentrations in the urine. No association was observed between other dietary patterns and SGA. Among pregnant Korean women, adherence to a dietary pattern characterized by high intakes of grains, green/yellow and light-colored vegetables, kimchi, legumes, fruits, meat, eggs, fish, seaweeds, tofu/soymilk, yogurt, and nuts is associated with a lower risk of delivering SGA infants.",

    "title": "Association between Ultra-processed Food Consumption and Dietary Intake and Diet Quality in Korean Adults.",
    "abstract": "Food environments have changed rapidly, and the global interest in ultra-processed foods has increased. Ultra-processed foods are typically energy dense, high in sugars and fat, and low in fiber, protein, minerals, and vitamins. This study aimed to estimate the energy contribution of ultra-processed foods in the diet of Korean adults and to examine the association between ultra-processed food consumption and dietary intake and diet quality. This study is a secondary analysis of cross-sectional data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2016-2018). A total of 16,657 adults aged ≥19 years who completed a 1-day 24-hour recall. Absolute and relative intake of energy and nutrients were measured and dietary quality was assessed using the Korean Healthy Eating Index (KHEI). Multiple regression models adjusted for sociodemographic variables were used to examine the association between quintiles of ultra-processed foods dietary energy contribution and dietary intake and quality. Mean reported daily energy intake was 2,031 kcal, with 25.1% of calories coming from ultra-processed foods. Mean energy contribution from ultra-processed foods ranged from 3.6% kcal (Q1) to 52.4% kcal (Q5). Energy contribution of ultra-processed foods was positively associated with reported intake of daily energy, total sugars, and total and saturated fat and inversely associated with reported intake of carbohydrates, fiber, minerals, and vitamins. Both sodium and potassium were negatively associated with percentage of energy from ultra-processed foods. However, the sodium-to-potassium ratio was high regardless of quintile of energy contribution from ultra-processed foods, and the ratio was positively associated with percentage of total energy from ultra-processed foods. Although the KHEI score was inversely associated with percentage of daily energy from ultra-processed foods, all levels of ultra-processed food consumption were associated with poor diet quality. The ultra-processed foods consumption of Korean adults accounted for one fourth of daily energy intake, and a higher dietary energy contribution from ultra-processed foods was associated with poorer dietary intakes and a lower dietary quality. Further studies are needed to understand factors influencing selection and consumption of ultra-processed foods and to identify effective strategies to promote healthy food choices.",

    "abstract": "Dietary carbohydrate restriction or ketogenic diets are known to be beneficial in preventing liver fat accumulation. However, the effect of ketonemia on the risk of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in nondiabetic population is largely unknown. We investigated the association between fasting ketonuria and the risk of incident NAFLD in healthy adults. A cohort of 153,076 nondiabetic Koreans with no hepatic steatosis and low probability of fibrosis at baseline was followed for a median of 4.1 years. The outcome was incident hepatic steatosis with or without liver fibrosis, and it was assessed by liver ultrasound and noninvasive fibrosis indices, including fibrosis-4 and the NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS). Parametric proportional hazard models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for outcome according to ketonuria status. Within 677,702.1 person-years of follow-up, 31,079 subjects developed hepatic steatosis. Compared with no ketonuria (reference), fasting ketonuria was significantly associated with a decreased risk of incident hepatic steatosis, with multivariable-adjusted HRs (95% confidence interval) of 0.81 (0.78-0.84). The corresponding HRs for incident hepatic steatosis with intermediate-to-high NFS were 0.79 (0.69-0.90). Similar associations were observed replacing NFS with fibrosis-4. In addition, the presence of persistent ketonuria at both baseline and subsequent visit was associated with the greatest decrease in the adjusted HR for incident NAFLD. Ketonuria was associated with a reduced risk of developing incident hepatic steatosis with and without intermediate-to-high probability of advanced fibrosis in a large cohort of nondiabetic healthy individuals. The role of hyperketonemia in the prevention of NAFLD requires further exploration.",

    "title": "Relationship between symptoms and both stage of change in adopting a healthy life style and quality of life in patients with liver cirrhosis: a cross-sectional study.",
    "abstract": "Previous studies of patients with liver cirrhosis have not considered the broad range of symptoms or the association between healthy behavior and quality of life. The purposes of this study were to examine the association between symptoms and adopting exercise and consuming fruits and vegetables and to identify factors associated with quality of life in patients with liver cirrhosis. This cross-sectional study enrolled 91 consecutive patients with liver cirrhosis in one tertiary general hospital in South Korea between February 2016 and January 2017. Each study participant completed a self-administered questionnaire that measured symptom, stage of change in engaging in exercise and consumption of fruits and vegetables, and the Korean version of the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey. Multivariate ordinal logistic regression analysis and multiple regression models was used, respectively, to examine the association between each symptom with stage of change in engaging in exercise and consumption of fruits and vegetables and to evaluate factors affecting quality of life. Experiencing nausea was associated with more readiness for change in engaging in exercise, but experiencing shortness of breath was associated with less readiness for change in engaging in exercise. Experiencing right upper quadrant pain was associated with more readiness for change in engaging in consumption of fruits and vegetables. Muscle cramps, anorexia, right upper quadrant pain and body pain, itching, ascites or edema, bruising, and change in appearance negatively affected quality of life. The results suggest that the types of symptoms experienced by a patient with liver cirrhosis hinder or promote the patient's adoption of exercise and dietary behavior. Experiencing symptoms may negatively affect quality of life. Caregivers should provide supportive care to patients with liver cirrhosis, which includes assessing and managing symptoms to improve quality of life.",

    "abstract": "There is a dearth of information regarding the association between coffee consumption and its health effects with respect to mortality among Korean people. The aim of this study was to examine the association between coffee consumption and all-cause mortality and cause-specific mortality risks in the Korean population. This prospective cohort study had a median follow-up period of 9.1 years. In total, 173,209 participants aged 40 years and older from the Health Examinees study were enrolled between 2004 and 2013. The analytic sample included 110,920 participants without diabetes, cardiovascular disease (CVD), or cancer at baseline who could be linked with their death information. Deaths of participants until December 31, 2018 were ascertained using the death certificate database of the National Statistical Office. Cause of death was classified according to the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision. Participants were categorized according to the amount and type of coffee consumed. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was performed to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95%CI of all-cause mortality and cause-specific mortality, such as CVD and cancer mortality. Compared with nonconsumers of coffee, participants who consumed > 3 cups/day had a reduced risk of all-cause mortality (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.95). Participants who consumed ≤1 cup/day and 1 to 3 cups/day had a reduced risk of CVD mortality (≤1 cup/day: HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.94; 1 to 3 cups/day: HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.96). This study provides evidence that greater coffee consumption is associated with a decreased risk of all-cause mortality and moderate coffee consumption (approximately 3 cups/day) is associated with a decreased risk of CVD mortality, regardless of the type of coffee, in a Korean population.",

    "abstract": "Plant-based diets have been suggested to have beneficial effects on various health outcomes. However, the evidence on the association of plant-based diet quality with health outcomes is very limited in Asian populations, who may have a different dietary pattern than western populations. This study explored the prospective association between different types of plant-based diets and risk of hypertension using recently established indices in South Koreans. Analyses were based on a community-based cohort of 5636 men and women (40-69 years of age at baseline, mean ± SD 50.6 ± 8.5 years) living in Ansan and Ansung, South Korea (2001-2016) without hypertension and related chronic diseases at baseline. Registration card and telephone registration number were used for the sampling. Dietary intakes were assessed using a validated food frequency questionnaire. Based on the questionnaire, scores of three plant-based diet indices [overall plant-based diet index (PDI), healthful plant-based diet index (hPDI), and unhealthful plant-based diet index (uPDI)] were calculated. Over a follow-up of 14 years, 2244 participants developed hypertension. Individuals in the highest vs. lowest quintile of hPDI had 35% lower incidence of hypertension [hazard ratio (HR) 0.65, 95% CI 0.57, 0.75] and uPDI had 44% higher incidence of hypertension (HR 1.44, 95% CI 1.24, 1.67), adjusting for demographic characteristics, and lifestyle factors (P trend ≤ 0.0001 for both indices). A similar inverse association of hPDI was observed with risk of hypertension by age, sex, residence area, and obesity. The PDI was not associated with hypertension. Our results highlight the importance of considering the quality of plant foods (relatively higher healthy plant foods and relatively lower less healthy plant foods consumption) for the prevention of hypertension in a population with a long-term adherence to predominantly plant-based diets.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to examine the cross-sectional association between adherence to dietary guidelines for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and depression. A total of 3457 patients with T2DM were included. Dietary information was obtained using 24-h recall, and adherence to dietary guidelines was estimated using the Korean Diabetes Association-Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare index. Depression was evaluated using a questionnaire. Participants who had responded \"yes\" to any of the three questions related to diagnosis, current condition, and treatment were defined as depression. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to examine the association between adherence to dietary guidelines and depression. T2DM patients with a lower score on adherence to dietary guidelines were more likely to report depression than those with a higher score (Odds ratios (OR): 0.51, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.30-0.87). Patients with poor adherence to moderate calorie consumption (OR: 1.65, 95% CI: 1.07-2.52) and regular meal patterns (OR: 1.69, 95% CI: 1.15-2.50) were more likely to report depression. However, patients with poor adherence to low sodium intake were less likely to report depression (OR: 0.60, 95% CI: 0.40-0.88), and no association was observed between moderate carbohydrate consumption, sufficient vegetable/seaweed consumption, and moderate alcohol consumption and depression. Good adherence to dietary guidelines was closely associated with a lower prevalence of depression among individuals with type 2 diabetes, but the specific guidelines were inconsistent. Systematic and continuous nutrition education for individuals with T2DM is necessary to improve their mental health outcomes.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this umbrella review was to summarise the evidence from existing systematic reviews on the association between different dietary patterns (DP) and overweight or obesity outcomes in adults. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and searched the MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane, Scopus, and Web of Science for systematic reviews reporting on DP and weight gain or overweight/obesity outcomes. We identified 16 systematic reviews with 143 unique studies published between 2001 and 2019. Overall quality scores ranged from 4 to 10. Six reviews in 2/11 cohort and 6/19 cross-sectional studies reported (statistically significant) decreased OR for obesity (range: 0·53 to 0·73 and 0·35 to 0·88, respectively) associated with the Mediterranean diet. Five reviews in 5/15 cohort and 10/45 cross-sectional studies reported an inverse association between diet quality and weight gain or BMI (β range: -1·3 to -0·09). Two reviews in 1/3 cohort and 1/2 cross-sectional studies reported a decreased risk of obesity (OR = 0·76) and weight gain (OR = 0·26), respectively, with fruit and vegetable intake. Five reviews of mixed DP in 3/40 cross-sectional studies reported an increased prevalence of obesity (OR = 1·19) or abdominal obesity (OR range: 1·07 to 1·27) with the Korean diet pattern. Our umbrella review confirms the hypothesis that Mediterranean-type DP reduce the risk of obesity in adults. Although population-specific evidence of effective interventions is needed, characteristics of Mediterranean-type DP are important considerations for national obesity prevention strategies.",

    "title": "Differences in Dietary Patterns Identified by the Gaussian Graphical Model in Korean Adults With and Without a Self-Reported Cancer Diagnosis.",
    "abstract": "The synergistic effect of food groups on health outcomes is better captured by examining dietary patterns (DPs) than single food groups. Regarding this issue, a Gaussian graphical model (GGM) can identify pairwise correlations between food groups and adjust for the remaining items. However, the application of GGMs in the nutritional field has not been widely investigated, especially in Korean adults. The aim of this study was to identify the major DPs of Korean adults by using a GGM and to examine the associations between the DP scores and prevalence of self-reported cancer. This cross-sectional study used baseline data from the 2007-2019 Cancer Screenee Cohort of the National Cancer Center, Korea. In total, 10,777 Korean adults who completed a questionnaire regarding their general medical history, including clinical test results, and a validated food frequency questionnaire were included. The main outcome measure was the prevalence of self-reported cancer at baseline. DP networks were identified using a GGM. The GGM-identified networks were scored and categorized into tertiles, and their association with the prevalence of self-reported cancer was investigated using a multivariable logistic regression model. The GGM identified the following 4 DP networks: principal, oil-sweet, meat, and fruit. After adjusting for covariates, the odds of moderate and high consumption of foods in the oil-sweet DP for participants who self-reported cancer were 25% and 34% lower than those for participants who did not report a cancer diagnosis (odds ratio [OR] = 0.75, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.62-0.90 and OR = 0.66, 95% CI = 0.53-0.81, respectively). Additionally, the odds of meat DP consumption in the self-reported cancer group was 29% lower than in participants who did not report a cancer diagnosis (OR = 0.71 and 95% CI = 0.57-0.88). In contrast, an increase in the odds of fruit DP consumption was observed for self-reported cancer participants (OR = 1.34 and 95% CI = 1.09-1.65). Similar results were observed among the female but not the male subjects. GGM is a novel method that can distinguish the direct pairwise correlation of food groups and control for the indirect effect of other foods. Future large-scale longitudinal population-based studies are needed to build on these findings in general populations.",

A total of 5,137 workers aged 20-64 years were included. Dietary assessment was conducted using a 24-hour dietary recall. In total, 41.2% participants skipped one meal or more per day. The percentage of workers who skipped meals was 43.1±1.0% among participants who did not use workplace foodservices compared to 31.8±1.9% among those who did (P<0.01). Skipping meals was significantly associated with not using workplace foodservices, after adjusting for other confounders including sociodemographic variables, health-related variables, and meal procurement source (odds ratio = 3.4; 95% confidence interval = 2.6-4.4; P<0.01). We found a significant association between using workplace foodservices and reduced skipping meals in Korean adult workers. This study suggests the importance of the provision of workplace foodservices for workers to potentially reduce poor eating behaviours such as skipping meals.",

We enrolled 8336 Korean elderly people aged ≥65 who participated in the dietary intake survey (24-h recall methods) of the 2013-2018 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination (KNHANES). The intake of fruits and unsalted/non-starchy vegetables was 372.06 g/day. According to age group, the intake in the age group 65-74 years as 422.47 g/day, and the intake in the age group 75 years + was 301.12 g/day. Based on the intake of daily meals and snacks, the intake of fruits and unsalted/non-starchy vegetables was the highest in snack-eating individuals (480.96 g/day). The subjects who consumed more than the World Health Organization (WHO)/World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF)'s plant food intake standards (over 400 g/day of intake of fruits and unsalted/non-starchy vegetables) were 35.47% of the elderly people. These results suggest that it is necessary to develop more fundamental strategies to increase fruits and vegetables intake among elderly people. Furthermore, the study outcomes are expected to provide basic information for developing education programs to improve the dietary life of Korean elderly people.",

    "abstract": "Identifying dietary patterns that contribute to dyslipidemia development can inform prevention, nutritional counseling, and other treatment recommendations. This study aimed to identify major dietary patterns and examine the association between these dietary patterns and dyslipidemia incidence by sex among Koreans. The Health Examinees (HEXA) study is a community-based prospective cohort study. The baseline and follow-up surveys were conducted in 2004-2013, and 2012-2016, respectively, at 38 health examination centers and training hospitals located in eight regions in Korea. Dietary intake data were collected using a web-based, validated semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) at baseline. Among 65,642 participants who completed the baseline and follow-up survey, data from 38,170 participants without dyslipidemia and other related chronic diseases at baseline were analyzed. Incidence of dyslipidemia and its components (hypercholesterolemia, hyper-low-density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterolemia, hypo-high-density lipoprotein [HDL] cholesterolemia, and hypertriglyceridemia) after baseline but before the follow-up examination was examined. Factor analysis was conducted on data from the semiquantitative FFQ to identify major dietary patterns for Korean adults. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was performed to estimate the relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) according to the quintiles of three dietary pattern scores, after adjusting for potential confounders by sex. Of the three identified dietary patterns, the higher \"prudent\" pattern score was associated with a lower incidence of dyslipidemia (RR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.82-0.99; P = .02) after adjusting for potential confounders in women. Higher \"flour-based food and meats\" pattern score was associated with a higher incidence of hypercholesterolemia (men: RR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.21-2.20; P = .003; women: RR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.30-1.67; P < .001), hyper-LDL cholesterolemia (men: RR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.03-2.04, P = .06; women: RR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.16-1.58, P < .001), and dyslipidemia (men: RR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.09-1.54; P = .009; women: RR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.16-1.42; P < .001) in both men and women. The \"white rice\" pattern score was associated with a lower incidence of hypo-HDL cholesterolemia (RR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.58-0.96; P = .01) and dyslipidemia (RR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.81-0.99; P = .07) in women. Adherence to the \"prudent\" and \"white rice\" patterns was associated with a lower dyslipidemia risk in Korean women, whereas adherence to the \"flour-based food and meats\" pattern was associated with increased risks of dyslipidemia and its components (hypercholesterolemia and hyper-LDL cholesterolemia) in both Korean men and women.",

    "abstract": "The prevalence of stress and distress has been increasing and being important public health issues; nevertheless, few studies have assessed the factors associated at the population level. This study identified factors associated and how they differentially influence stress and distress. A total of 35,105 individuals aged 19 years and older using nationally representative data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2007-2012) were included in the study. Subjects were differentiated by gender and psychological state (no symptoms, stress, distress). The associations of socio-demographics, psychosocial factors, health behaviours, and chronic illness with psychological states were analysed by gender. Socio-demographics and psychosocial factors such as lower household income, lower education level, living alone or negative outcome of marriage, and unemployment were associated with distress in both genders. Male and female educated higher and with short sleep duration, male living alone and with higher household income, and female married and with a lower household income was associated with stress. A perceived body image of slim or fat was associated with distress and stress in both genders. Behavioural factors, such as smoking, higher alcohol consumption, and abnormal calorie intake, were associated with stress and distress in both genders, with the exception of alcohol consumption in distress and abnormal calorie intake in stress of male. Socio-economic deprivation and negative psychosocial and behavioural factors were differently associated with psychological distress or stress by gender. Intervention strategies for distress and stress should be specifically tailored regarding these differences.",

    "abstract": "The global prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is increasing with the aging of populations worldwide. As kidney function declines, the accumulation of metabolic waste products and excessive electrolytes can significantly impair the health of patients with CKD. As nutritional management of patients with CKD is thought to control uremic symptoms and provide beneficial effects on the progression of kidney dysfunction, the diet of patients with CKD should be an important consideration in their care. Many guidelines recommend limiting protein intake in these patients, as high-protein diets aggravate kidney dysfunction. Excess sodium may be associated with CKD progression and all-cause mortality and, therefore, limiting salt intake is generally recommended. Low potassium is associated with muscle weakness and hypertension, whereas high potassium is associated with cardiac arrhythmia. Therefore, recent guidelines recommend adjusting dietary potassium intake on an individual basis to maintain serum potassium levels within the normal range. Appropriate dietary calcium intake is recommended to maintain calcium balance in patients with CKD G3, G4. Given the many dietary considerations for patients with CKD, effective nutritional management is challenging. Individualized strategies are needed to ensure the best outcome for patients with CKD.",

    "abstract": "Long-term glycemic variability is associated with various adverse health outcomes in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). However, the relationship between glycemic variability and gastric cancer remains unclear. We aimed to investigate the association between glycemic variability and gastric cancer incidence in individuals without DM. We used the Korean National Health Insurance Service data sets of claims and health checkups and included 202,562 individuals without DM. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) variability was measured using the variability independent of the mean (VIM), coefficient of variation, SD, and average successive variability. The association between FPG variability and gastric cancer incidence was analyzed using Cox regression adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, smoking status, alcohol consumption, regular exercise, income level, family history of cancer, mean FPG level, and number/mean interval of FPG measurements. In total, 1,920 patients developed gastric cancer (0.95%) within a median follow-up of 5.6 (5.3, 6.4) years. The fully adjusted hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval for gastric cancer were 1.26 and 1.18-1.34, respectively, in the highest quartile of FPG variability assessed by VIM compared with that in the lowest quartile. Similar results were obtained in the normal and impaired fasting glucose groups and when using the variability indexes, including coefficient of variation, SD, and average successive variability. There was a sequential increase in the incidence of gastric cancer according to the increase in the deciles of FPG variability (P for linear trend <0.001). A 1-SD increase in FPG variability assessed by VIM was significantly associated with a 10.0% increase in gastric cancer risk in the fully adjusted model. In a DM-free population, high variability in visit-to-visit FPG levels was independently associated with an increased risk of gastric cancer.",

    "abstract": "Kimjang kimchi is traditionally made in Korea in autumn to preserve vegetables during colder winter times after the harvest. Kimjang is an important societal tradition in which families and communities come together to process vegetables, such as cabbage, into kimchi. The origin of the microorganisms that contribute to the flavor and safety during fermentation is still unclear. Although bacteria present on the raw ingredients are considered to be important colonizers of the fermentation, in Korean culture, the term \"Sonmat\" is often used, which literally translates into \"hand flavor,\" suggesting a role for hand microbiota in the kimchi fermentation. In this citizen-science project, we investigate the impact of the hand microbiome on kimchi fermentation during the Sonmat festival organized in Belgium. The kimchi fermentations contained mainly lactic acid bacteria belonging to the genera  Vegetable fermentation has been a staple of human culture for centuries, with deeply rooted traditions behind it. However, the effects of these traditional practices on the microbes in the final fermented product, and their origin, are often not understood. By using participatory citizen-science approaches, it is possible to study these important foods while preserving the authenticity and integrity of the traditional fermentation practices that define them. The results obtained from our citizen-science case study support the importance of exploring traditional fermentation practices and their effect on microbial and sensory properties of fermented foods. Additionally, our case study found associations between microbiota present on the hand and microbiota important in the early successional stage of kimchi fermentation.",

    "title": "Microbiological survey of spontaneous vegetable fermentations: A food safety perspective.",
    "abstract": "A survey of 75 commercially available, unpasteurised, spontaneously fermented vegetables was conducted, focusing on the culturable microbiota. Foodborne pathogens (Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella sp.), indicator bacteria (generic E. coli, Enterobacteriaceae), and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were analysed both at the day of purchase and at the end of shelf life. Selected samples were further examined for biogenic amines, and dominant culturable LAB were isolated and identified. Challenge tests evaluated the growth potential of L. monocytogenes during white cabbage fermentation. Results showed considerable variation in pH (3.1-4.3) and LAB counts (<1.0-8.8 log CFU/g), reflecting the spontaneous nature of the vegetable fermentations. No Salmonella sp. (detection in 25 g), L. monocytogenes (LOD 10 CFU/g), or E. coli (LOD 10 CFU/g) were detected, indicating no immediate food safety or hygiene concerns, although Enterobacteriaceae were present (LOD 10 CFU/g) in six samples, suggesting an inadequate (spontaneous) fermentation process to ensure die-off of enteric pathogens. LAB isolates were dominated by Pediococcus parvulus, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum, Levilactobacillus brevis, and Lentilactobacillus buchneri. High biogenic amine levels highlight an increased risk for adverse health effects related to spontaneous vegetable fermentations. Challenge tests confirmed that rapid acidification to pH <4.4, followed by a minimum 14-day holding period under optimal fermentation conditions, effectively limits pathogen outgrowth and/or survival. Good fermentation practices, together with a sensory evaluation are essential to ensure the microbiological safety, quality, and consistency of spontaneous vegetable fermentations.",

    "abstract": "Two Gram-stain-positive, facultatively anaerobic, rod-shaped, and non-motile lactic acid bacterial strains, designated as strains CBA3605T and CBA3606T, were isolated from kimchi, a traditional Korean fermented food. Both strains were oxidase- and catalase-negative, non-spore-forming, non-hemolytic, and non-gas-producing. Optimal growth conditions for the two strains were observed at 30°C, pH 5.0, and 0% NaCl. The two genomes were composed of a circular chromosome and three plasmids and the DNA G + C content of 43.0%, respectively. Strains CBA3605T and CBA3606T were most closely related to Lactiplantibacillus (Lp.) pingfangensis 382-1T with 16S rRNA sequence similarity of 99.4% and 99.1%, respectively. However, the orthologous average nucleotide identities between CBA3605T and CBA3606T were 91.7%, and those with strain 382-1T were 76.9% and 76.5%, respectively. Digital DNA-DNA hybridization values between CBA3605T and CBA3606T were 45.0%, and those with strain 382-1T were 21.4% and 21.0%, respectively. The major fatty acids detected in both strains included C16:0, C18:1 ω9c, and summed features 7 (C19:1 ω7c, C19:1 ω6c, C19:0 cyclo ω10c, and/or C19:0 ω6c). The peptidoglycan of both strains CBA3605T and CBA3606T contained meso-diaminopimelic acid and was classified as A4α type (L-Lys-D-Asp). In polar lipid analyses, only strain CBA3605T contained aminophosphoglycolipid, which was absent in CBA3606T, although both strains harbored same major polar lipids (diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, and phosphatidylethanolamine). Based on phenotypic, phylogenetic, genomic, biochemical, and chemotaxonomic analyses, strains CBA3605T and CBA3606T represent two novel species of the genus Lactiplantibacillus, for which the names Lactiplantibacillus koreensis sp. nov. and Lactiplantibacillus kimchii sp. nov. are proposed, with CBA3605T (= KACC 81073BPT = JCM 37965T), and CBA3606T (= KACC 81074BPT = JCM 37966T) as the type strains.",

    "abstract": "Food science and technology have evolved to enhance food availability, nutrition, safety, and marketability, addressing global challenges such as hunger and malnutrition. However, projections indicate that by 2030, over 670 million people may face hunger, emphasizing the need for innovative and sustainable solutions. Ethnic fermented foods (EFF) originate from the heritage and culture of various ethnic groups who utilize their ethnomicrobiological knowledge of fermentation with local plant- or animal-based ingredients. EFF provide a promising approach to promote a healthier, sustainable, and more inclusive global food system. They are also traditionally produced by combining local ingredients with artisanal practices. However, urbanization and changes in eating habits threaten the preservation of EFF and the associated native microorganisms that are essential for their production. This research systematically examines health-related endpoints reported in human clinical studies of EFF. While some EFF such as natto, kimchi, and tempeh, originating from Asia have gained global recognition and consumption, multiple others remain unknown and understudied. This comprehensive narrative review aims to identify the potential health benefits associated with these foods. A systematic search in PubMed, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library Central initially resulted in 3,488 entries, which were narrowed down to 125 reports fulfilling the selection criteria defined to identify human studies investigating the functionality of EFF. CADIMA software was used to manage and select references. Data synthesis focused on clinical indications, offering valuable insights into health benefits of EFF, such as gut health, immune modulation, metabolic benefit, cognitive function, cardiovascular, bone, oral, eye, skin health and antimicrobial effect. This systematic narrative review highlights the importance of EFF in improving health, emphasizing their role in sustainable food systems, and underscoring the importance of preserving traditional practices. https://osf.io/hnksr/.",

    "abstract": "Ulcerative colitis (UC) is associated with intestinal barrier dysfunction, gut microbiome (GM) dysbiosis, inflammation, and immune dysregulation. Lactic acid bacteria-derived exopolysaccharides (LAB-EPS) have biotherapeutic potential to stimulate immune responses and influence the GM. Therefore, this work aimed to extract the bioactive EPS (EPS-W-1) from Lactiplantibacillus plantarum ZL1, isolated from Korean kimchi, and then characterize the chemical structure of EPS-W-1 using HPLC, GC-MS, and NMR. The effect of EPS-W-1 treatment on the UC mice was evaluated. The composition of EPS-W-1 was rhamnose (5.06 %), galactose (25.79 %), glucose (53.37 %), and mannose (10.93 %), and its molecular weight (MW) was 260.34 kDa. The colon length increased in the treatment group H-EPS-W-1 (8.9 cm) compared to the DSS group (4.46 cm). In addition, the H-EPS-W-1 treatment improved histological architecture, regulated the GM, and triggered the higher generation of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) than the DSS group. It also modulated immune responses by downregulating IL-6 (-48.64 %) and TNF-α (-60.25 %), while upregulating IL-10 (+107.43 %). Collectively, these findings suggest that EPS-W-1 possesses significant therapeutic potential in ameliorating UC through modulation of the GM and regulation of the immune system.",

    "abstract": "Fermented foods have been consumed for thousands of years and have been used as a model system to study community succession and other ecological questions. Additionally, cooking classes offer opportunities to learn about food preparation and history. In the present study, scientists and chefs delivered cooking-class style workshops in which participants learned the recipes of one of three fermented foods and the microbial ecology within these foods. Participants prepared jars of chow chow, kimchi, or kombucha to set up experiments to study microbial community succession and pH changes. The fermented foods were also used to test the following hypotheses: that increasing the number of substrates results in increased alpha diversity, and that phylogenetically diverse substrates will lead to greater beta diversity among microbial communities. Microbial communities contained lactic and acetic acid bacteria described previously in fermented foods, and indicator species were identified for cabbage and radish substrates in kimchi. Finally, we qualitatively comment on the experience of developing workshops with chefs and the use of participatory science in these experiments.IMPORTANCEThe present study demonstrates the utility of using fermented foods as an inexpensive and effective tool to investigate ecological phenomena and engage the public in microbiology and ecology through cooking-class style workshops. We also model a creative, interdisciplinary collaboration between scientists and chefs.",

    "abstract": "The impact of fermented foods on human health, particularly through gut microbiota, is a widely discussed topic. However, the number of nutritional studies demonstrating their health benefits remains limited. This study evaluated the effects of fermented vegetables (FVs) intake including fermented carrots, kohlrabi, and kimchi on human health parameters, with a primary focus on gut microbiota. In addition to microbiota analysis, we assessed anthropometric parameters, stool frequency, and data from nutritional diaries. A total of 65 volunteers were recruited, of whom 55 completed the study. FVs are valuable health products, combining dietary fibers and lactic acid bacteria, both essential for supporting normal gut microbiota. To better understand the effects of FV consumption in different populations, participants were divided into three groups: controls without reported health problems (CTRL), individuals with constipation (CONS), and those recovering from an antibiotic course (AB). Multiple analytical approaches were applied to evaluate: (1) the effects of FV consumption within the three focus groups, (2) the response of different gut enterotypes to a three-week FV consumption period based on taxonomic hierarchical analyses, and (3) the combined effects across the entire cohort. The choice of analyzed groups was crucial for interpreting the results, revealing varied effects depending on the context. Overall, the findings showed that consuming FVs modified gut microbiota composition, increasing the abundance of butyrate-producing and anti-inflammatory bacterial species. Additionally, phase angle, a key indicator of cellular health reflecting cell integrity and hydration, showed statistically significant improvement across the cohort, indicating better metabolic health after the intervention. Food diaries further revealed a reduction in sugar consumption among participants, highlighting an additional benefit of enriching diets with fermented foods. These results demonstrate the clear positive impact of FV consumption on human health, particularly through gut microbiota modulation and metabolic improvements.",

The fermentation was conducted with autoclaved (group A) and non-autoclaved (NA) starter cultures. Bacterial and fungal communities were analyzed with 16S rRNA gene V4 and ITS2 region, respectively, and metabolites were profiled using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. In the group NA, Levilactobacillus dominated at 64.3 % by day 5, while Pediococcus reached 57.4 % by day 50. Principal coordinate analysis showed that bacterial communities in both the starter culture and samples of the group NA became similar by the end of the fermentation (day 100); however, no significant differences were found in fungal community. Principal component analysis revealed distinct metabolite profiles, explaining 68.7 % of variability on PC1, with each group clustered separately by day 100. These results suggest that inoculating with microbiota from long-term fermentation can rapidly produce foods with desirable characteristics.",

Dominant bacteria at the end of fermentation were Companilactobacillus and Latilactobacillus in the control and WCFY-inoculated samples, respectively. The fungal communities of control sample remained stable, whereas those for WCFY-inoculated samples showed Kazachstania or Pichia dominance. Metabolite analysis revealed significant increases in glycerol, erythritol, and myo-inositol in WCFY-inoculated samples. Correlation analysis showed that Lactococcus and Weissella were negatively correlated with Kazachstania. This study underscores ecological role of WCFYs in kimchi fermentation, particularly their impact on microbial communities and metabolites, suggesting the need for strategies that control WCFY growth to improve kimchi quality.",

This study evaluated the potential of kimchi with various probiotics and bioactive compounds as a dietary intervention for high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity in rats. Through a comprehensive analysis incorporating global and targeted metabolomics, gut microbiota profiling, and biochemical markers, we investigated the effects of the 12-week kimchi intake on HFD-induced obesity. Kimchi intake modestly mitigated HFD-induced weight gain and remarkably altered gut microbiota composition, steroid hormones, bile acids, and metabolic profiles, but did not reduce adipose tissue accumulation. It also caused significant shifts in metabolomic pathways, including steroid hormone metabolism, and we found substantial interactions between dietary interventions and gut microbiota composition. Although more research is required to fully understand the anti-obesity effects of kimchi, our findings support the beneficial role of kimchi in managing obesity and related metabolic disorders.",

    "abstract": "Existing research has underscored the vital interplay between host organisms and their associated microbiomes, which affects health and function. In both plants and animals, host factors critically shape microbial communities and influence growth, health, and immunity. Post-harvest plants, such as those used in kimchi, a traditional Korean dish, offer a unique avenue for exploring host-microbe dynamics during fermentation. Despite the emphasis on lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in fermentation studies, the roles of host factors remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the influence of these factors on plant transcriptomes during kimchi fermentation. We individually inoculated nine LAB strains into germ-free kimchi to generate LAB-mono-associated gnotobiotic kimchi and performed RNA-sequencing analysis for the host vegetables during fermentation. The transcriptomes of post-harvest vegetables in kimchi change over time, and microbes affect the transcriptome profiles of vegetables. Differentially expressed gene analyses revealed that microbes affected the temporal expression profiles of several genes in the plant transcriptomes in unique directions depending on the introduced LAB strains. Cluster analysis with other publicly available transcriptomes of post-harvest vegetables and fruits further revealed that the plant transcriptome is more profoundly influenced by the environment harboring the host than by host phylogeny. Our results bridge the gap in understanding the bidirectional relationship between host vegetables and microbes during food fermentation, illuminating the complex interplay between vegetable transcriptomes, fermentative microbes, and the fermentation process in food production. The different transcriptomic responses elicited by specific LAB strains suggest the possibility of microbial manipulation to achieve the desired fermentation outcomes.",

Using a comprehensive approach, we examined the fermentation process using anchovies in two forms (whole and ground) and three different starter cultures. The use of ground anchovies resulted in an accelerated fermentation process for anchovy sauce; however, the increased diversity of bacterial phylotypes and altered accumulation of biogenic amines were observed. Inoculation of starter cultures resulted in a shift from spontaneous to controlled fermentation, highlighting their ability to regulate bacterial communities. Despite a slightly reduced fermentation rate, inoculation with Tetragenococcus halophilus was shown to be a potent method for reducing biogenic amines and affecting metabolite profiles. As the industry strives to balance fermentation speed and quality, our research could provide insights for improving the efficiency, safety, and quality of anchovy sauce production.",

Identifying the role of probiotics in individual diseases and immune responses and selecting and applying specific microorganisms based on these findings can be an effective strategy for using probiotics. Herein, lactobacilli isolated from kimchi were investigated in depth, focusing on their immune regulatory effects and the mechanisms involved. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) effectively diminished the increased secretion of T helper 2 cytokines, such as IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, from ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized mouse splenocytes. The gene expression of GATA3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, and IL-13 was confirmed to be regulated by LAB. LAB also suppressed IL-2 production and STAT5 phosphorylation. An IL-10-neutralizing antibody attenuated these effects, indicating that LAB-induced upregulation of IL-10 in antigen-presenting cells was responsible at least partially for the increased IL-2 production and STAT5 phosphorylation in CD4",

In this study, we investigated the microbial and metabolic changes that occur during the long-term aging of undiluted rice wine with different amount of sediment and aging temperatures. Rice wine samples with higher amounts of sediment had higher yeast counts and alcohol content, indicating a crucial role of sediment in providing nutrients for yeast survival during aging. Furthermore, the rice wine samples that were aged at 12 °C exhibited a notable increase in the relative abundance of Lactobacillus after 100 days of aging. Metabolic profiling revealed that the production of metabolites during rice wine aging was greatly influenced by the amount of sediment and aging temperature, with most metabolites showing a strong correlation with these factors.

    "abstract": "The antiobesity effects of kimchi with catechin and lactic acid bacteria as starters were studied in C57BL/6 mice with high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity. We prepared four types of kimchi: commercial kimchi, standard kimchi, green tea functional kimchi, and catechin functional kimchi (CFK). Body weight and weight of adipose tissue were significantly lower in the kimchi-treated groups than in the HFD and Salt (HFD +1.5% NaCl) groups. In addition, in the CFK group, the serum levels of triglycerides, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were significantly lower and those of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were markedly higher than the corresponding levels in the HFD and Salt groups. Moreover, CFK reduced fat cells and crown-like structures in the liver and epididymal fat tissues. The protein expression of adipo/lipogenesis-related genes in the liver and epididymal fat tissues was significantly lower (1.90-7.48-fold) in the CFK group than in the HFD and Salt groups, concurrent with upregulation of lipolysis-related genes (1.71-3.38-fold) and downregulation of inflammation-related genes (3.17-5.06-fold) in epididymal fat tissues.

    "abstract": "Foods and supplements containing microorganisms with expected beneficial effects are increasingly investigated and utilized in the treatment of human illness, including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Research points to a prominent role of gut dysbiosis in the multiple aberrations in gastrointestinal function, immune balance, and mental health seen in IBS. The proposition of the current Perspective is that fermented vegetable foods, in combination with a healthy and stable diet, may be particularly useful for addressing these disturbances. This is based on the recognition that plants and their associated microorganisms have contributed to shaping human microbiota and adaptation over evolutionary time. In particular, lactic acid bacteria with immunomodulatory, antipathogenic, and digestive properties are prevalent in products such as sauerkraut and kimchi. Additionally, by adjusting the salt content and fermentation time, products with a microbial and therapeutic potential beyond that of regular ferments could potentially be produced. Although more clinical data are required to make firm assertions, the low-risk profile, combined with biological considerations and reasoning and considerable circumstantial and anecdotal evidence, indicate that fermented vegetables are worthy of consideration by health professionals and patients dealing with IBS-related issues. To maximize microbial diversity and limit the risk of adverse effects, small doses of multiple products, containing different combinations of traditionally fermented vegetables and/or fruits, is suggested for experimental research and care.",

A total of 108 kimchi samples were collected from five different provinces in Korea to analyze the recipes, metabolites, microbes, and sensory characteristics. Overall, 18 ingredients (including salted anchovy and seaweed), 7 quality indicators (such as salinity and moisture content), 14 genera of microorganisms (mainly Tetragenococcus and Weissella belonging to LAB), and 38 metabolites contributed to the characteristics of kimchi by region. Kimchi from the southern and northern regions showed distinct metabolite profile (collected 108 kimchi) and flavor profile differences (kimchi manufactured using the standard regional recipes). This is the first study to investigate the terroir effect of kimchi by identifying differences in ingredients, metabolites, microbes, and sensory characteristics based on the region of production, and the correlations between these factors.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19, which is caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2), is the deadliest outbreak of this millennium. Despite adopting several precautionary strategies and guidelines, COVID-19 has spread rapidly, and the number of cases is still in escalation across the world. The various immune-boosting drugs with severe side effects and the vaccines approved after negotiated clinical trials have been struggling to cope with the emergence of new variants of the virus. Nevertheless, given a large number of asymptomatic cases, a high magnitude of recovery rate, and a relatively higher prevalence of morbidity and mortality among immunologically compromised individuals, those affected by an illness, and the elderly, it appears that a healthy microbiome and the associated immune responses are the key factors for survival. Incidentally, the consumption of traditionally popular and nutritious fermented foods, which are composed of biologically functional ingredients and several health-promoting probiotics, offers promising health benefits through the improvement of the immune system in general. Given the progress in functional food research, it has become crucial to understand the impact of a healthy microbiome and the immunomodulatory roles of fermented foods on the battles to combat infectious diseases. Based on the evidence of the impact of probiotics-based fermented foods, the beneficial roles of a few frequently consumed fermented foods in the management of various infections have been resolutely discussed in the present study, with a focus on their antagonistic and immune-modulating effects in the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic.",

    "abstract": "A high-fat diet (HFD) induces low-grade, chronic inflammation throughout the body including the hypothalamus, a key brain region involved in the control of satiety and energy expenditure in central nervous system (CNS). Kimchi is a traditional fermented Korean food, which is recognized as a healthy food. In this study, we evaluated its ability to suppress the obesity-induced inflammation in mice fed an HFD. Male C57BL/6 mice were fed an HFD or HFD with kimchi (pH 5.2 ∼ 5.8). Oral administration of kimchi significantly reduced the body weight, fat mass gain, and levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in serum. Furthermore, kimchi diminished the HFD-induced activation of astrocyte and microglial cells (reactive gliosis, a hallmark of CNS injury and inflammation) in hypothalamus region. IgG accumulation assay showed that kimchi ingestion suppressed HFD-induced breakage of the blood brain barrier (BBB) via upregulating the expression of tight junction molecules in cerebrovascular endothelial cells. In addition, kimchi modulated gut microbiome profiles, which showed an increase in the abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila. Moreover, kimchi enhanced acetate level and BBB integrity in A. muciniphila-colonized gnotobiotic mice. These results suggest that kimchi may exert beneficial effects to prevent and ameliorate obesity and associated neuroinflammation by changing gut microbiota composition and short-chain fatty acids production.",

In this study, we determined the role of three key LAB strains, Leuconostoc gelidum, Latilactobacillus sakei, Weissella koreensis originated from different raw ingredients during natural fermentation, as opposed to an axenic environment. Starter cultures were inoculated into food with wild indigenous microbial communities, and the dynamics of bacterial communities and metabolites were analyzed during fermentation. As bacteriophages within the food viral community directly affect fermentation by influencing bacterial function and composition, the diversity and composition of DNA viral communities were compared with those of corresponding bacterial communities using a metagenomic approach. Our results provide insights into the ecological role of LAB starters in food fermentation and the potential impact of bacteriophages as modulators of bacterial communities associated with the fermentation properties of kimchi.",

Kimchi was stored at 4 °C for 500 days, and the composition of the microbial community and the nature of metabolites were analyzed using metataxonomics and metabolomics. We confirmed that the taxa belonging to Leuconostoc and Weissella were dominant in the early stages of fermentation, while Latilactobacillus and Levilactobacillus were dominant in the middle and late fermentation stages, respectively. In the eukaryotic community, Cladosporium was dominant in the early stages, while Pichia and Hanseniaspora tended to increase in the middle and late fermentation stages. The longitudinal metabolite profile demonstrated that about half (55.7%) of the metabolites present in kimchi after 500 days of fermentation were produced within 15 days of fermentation due to rapid fermentation in the initial stage. These results revealed that even in a closed environment, the viable microbiota in fermented vegetables are not static but dynamic, and the composition of metabolites evolves accordingly during long-term fermentation.",

Brevibacterium was the major genus in Xiaoshan pickled radish. Lactobacillus-related genera and Vibrio were the major genera in fermented potherb mustard and its brine. Enterobacter and Cobetia were the major genera in fermented radish and its brine. Chromohalobacter was the major genus in the tuber mustard. These results indicated clear differences were there between the bacterial genera present in Xiaoshan pickled radish, fermented potherb mustard, fermented radish, and tuber mustard. This demonstrated the possible influences of raw materials and manufacturing processes. Furthermore, a large number of lactic acid bacteria were isolated and identified by culture-dependent and 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, which accounted for more than 68% of all the isolates. In addition, whole-genome analysis of Levilactobacillus suantsaii, Latilactobacillus sakei subsp. sakei, and Weissella cibaria showed that they had large numbers of genes associated with carbohydrate metabolism.

    "title": "Anti-Inflammatory and Immunomodulatory Properties of Fermented Plant Foods.",
    "abstract": "Fermented plant foods are gaining wide interest worldwide as healthy foods due to their unique sensory features and their health-promoting potentials, such as antiobesity, antidiabetic, antihypertensive, and anticarcinogenic activities. Many fermented foods are a rich source of nutrients, phytochemicals, bioactive compounds, and probiotic microbes. The excellent biological activities of these functional foods, such as anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory functions, are widely attributable to their high antioxidant content and lactic acid-producing bacteria (LAB). LAB contribute to the maintenance of a healthy gut microbiota composition and improvement of local and systemic immunity. Besides, antioxidant compounds are involved in several functional properties of fermented plant products by neutralizing free radicals, regulating antioxidant enzyme activities, reducing oxidative stress, ameliorating inflammatory responses, and enhancing immune system performance. Therefore, these products may protect against chronic inflammatory diseases, which are known as the leading cause of mortality worldwide. Given that a large body of evidence supports the role of fermented plant foods in health promotion and disease prevention, we aim to discuss the potential anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties of selected fermented plant foods, including berries, cabbage, and soybean products, and their effects on gut microbiota.",

The ODFM archives genome, metagenome, metataxonome, and (meta)transcriptome sequences of fermented food-associated bacteria, archaea, eukaryotic microorganisms, and viruses; 131 bacterial, 38 archaeal, and 28 eukaryotic genomes are now available to users. The ODFM provides both the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool search-based local alignment function as well as average nucleotide identity-based genetic relatedness measurement, enabling gene diversity and taxonomic analyses of an input query against the database. Genome sequences and annotation results of microorganisms are directly downloadable, and the microbial strains registered in the archive library will be available from our culture collection of fermented food-associated microorganisms. The ODFM is a comprehensive database that covers the genomes of an entire microbiome within a specific food ecosystem, providing basic information to evaluate microbial isolates as candidate fermentation starters for fermented food production.",

Concerns had increased on the modulation of intestinal microbiota on various kinds of systemic diseases. Under the hypothesis that dietary intake of kimchi can be ideal intervention for either ameliorating colitis or preventing colitic cancer, we performed the study to validate the efficolitic cancery of fermented kimchi on preventing colitic cancer. Using azoxymethane-initiated and dextran sulfate sodium-promoted colitic cancer models, we have administrated fermented or non-fermented kimchi to modulate colitic cancer preemptively. Detailed molecular mechanisms were explored. Preemptive administration of fermented kimchi significantly afforded colitic cancer prevention through attenuating inflammasomes (IL-18, IL-1β, caspase-1), enhancing antioxidative (NQO1, GST-π), imposing anti-proliferative (Bax, caspase-3, β-catenin), and affording cytoprotective actions (HSP70, 15-PGDH), while non-fermented kimchi did not prevent colitic cancer. Special recipe cancer preventive kimchi (cpkimchi) was more effective compared to standard recipe fermented kimchi (",

Identification of these microorganisms provides the essential information required to improve food quality and to understand their role in this process. This was the first study to compare two methods for accuracy in the identification of microbial community changes during the fermentation of kimchi by comparing a culture-dependent (MALDI-TOF MS analysis) and a culture-independent method (high-throughput sequencing) of 16S rRNA gene fragment). Members of the Lactobacillus-related genera, Leuconostoc, and Weissella were identified as the predominant microorganisms by both methods. The culture-independent method was able to additionally identify non-lactic acid bacteria and yeasts, such as Kazachstania in kimchi. However, high-throughput sequencing failed to accurately recognize Latilactobacillus sakei, Latilactobacillus curvatus, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum, and W. cibaria, which played an important role in kimchi fermentation, as this method only allowed for identification at the genus level. Conversely, MALDI-TOF MS analysis could identify the isolates at the species level. Also, culture-dependent method could identify predominant species in viable cell communities. The culture-dependent method and culture-independent method provided complementary information by producing a more comprehensive view of the microbial ecology in fermented kimchi.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of fungi on kimchi metabolites during fermentation. A gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) based metabolite profiling approach in combination with principal component analysis (PCA) is performed to differentiate metabolites produced by fungi or bacteria. To avoid bacterial growth, kimchi is treated with 100 μg/mL of ampicillin every three days from 30 to 50 days of fermentation. The relative content of the major fungi at 50 days of fermentation, between the control group and the ampicillin treatment group, was not significantly different. The administration of ampicillin changed the metabolites in kimchi by affecting the growth of kimchi bacteria. Based on the pattern of change of each metabolite, the changed metabolites are grouped into four categories: (1) metabolites produced or consumed by fungi, (2) metabolites involving both fungi and bacteria, (3) metabolites produced or consumed by bacteria, and (4) metabolites of undetermined origin. Alanine, thymine, galacturonic acid, and malonic acid can be regarded as the metabolites produced by fungi between 30 and 50 days of fermentation. In contrast, malic acid, oxaloacetic acid, galactitol, glucose, and mannitol are presumed to be the metabolites mainly consumed by fungi. This study is meaningful as the first study conducted by inhibiting growth of bacteria to identify the metabolites contributed by fungi or bacteria in the kimchi fermentation process. These results could be used to make customized kimchi that controls the production of desired metabolites by selectively controlling the formation of microbial communities in the kimchi industry.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to evaluate anti-obesity effects of kimchi microbial community (KMC) on obesity and gut microbiota using a high fat diet-induced mouse model compared to effects of a single strain. Administration of KMC decreased body weight, adipose tissue, and liver weight gains. Relative content of Muribaculaceae in the gut of the KMC-treated group was higher than that in the high-fat diet (HFD) group whereas relative contents of Akkermansiaceae, Coriobacteriaceae, and Erysipelotrichaceae were lower in KMC-treated group. Metabolic profile of blood was found to change differently according to the administration of KMC and a single strain of Lactobacillus plantarum. Serum metabolites significantly increased in the HFD group but decreased in the KMC-treated group included arachidic acid, stearic acid, fumaric acid, and glucose, suggesting that the administration of KMC could influence energy metabolism. The main genus in KMC was not detected in guts of mice in KMC-treated group. Since the use of KMC has advantages in terms of safety, it has potential to improve gut microbial community for obese people.",

    "abstract": "The human microbiota is a key contributor to many aspects of human health and its composition is largely influenced by diet. There is a growing body of scientific evidence to suggest that gut dysbiosis (microbial imbalance of the intestine) is associated with inflammatory and immune-mediated diseases (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease and asthma). Regular consumption of fermented foods (e.g., kimchi, kefir, etc.) may represent a potential avenue to counter the proinflammatory effects of gut dysbiosis. However, an assessment of the available literature in this research area is lacking. Here we provide a critical review of current human intervention studies that analyzed the effect of fermented foods on the composition and/or function of the human gut microbiota. A total of 19 human intervention studies were identified that met this search criteria. In this review, we discuss evidence that consumption of fermented foods may modify the gut microbiota in humans. Further, there is cursory evidence to suggest that gut microbiota compositional changes mediate associations between fermented food consumption and human health outcomes. Although promising, there remains considerable heterogeneity in the human populations targeted in the intervention studies we identified. Larger longitudinal feeding studies with longer follow-up are necessary to confirm and enhance the current data. Further, future studies should consider analyzing microbiota function as a means to elucidate the mechanism linking fermented food consumption with human health. This review highlights methodologic considerations for intervention trials, emphasizing an expanse of research opportunities related to fermented food consumption in humans.",

Only kimchi cabbage- and garlic-derived microbial inoculums yielded successful kimchi fermentations. The dominant fermentative microbial taxa and subsequent metabolic outputs differed by raw ingredient type: the genus Leuconostoc, Weissella, and Lactobacillus for all non-sterilized ingredients, garlic, and kimchi cabbage, respectively. Gnotobiotic kimchi inoculated by mono-, di-, and tri- isolated fermentative microbe combinations further revealed W. koreensis-mediated reversible microbial metabolic outputs.

In recent years, fermented foods have undergone a surge in popularity, mainly due to their proposed health benefits. The aim of this review is to define and characterise common fermented foods (kefir, kombucha, sauerkraut, tempeh, natto, miso, kimchi, sourdough bread), their mechanisms of action (including impact on the microbiota), and the evidence for effects on gastrointestinal health and disease in humans. Putative mechanisms for the impact of fermented foods on health include the potential probiotic effect of their constituent microorganisms, the fermentation-derived production of bioactive peptides, biogenic amines, and conversion of phenolic compounds to biologically active compounds, as well as the reduction of anti-nutrients. Fermented foods that have been tested in at least one randomised controlled trial (RCT) for their gastrointestinal effects were kefir, sauerkraut, natto, and sourdough bread. Despite extensive in vitro studies, there are no RCTs investigating the impact of kombucha, miso, kimchi or tempeh in gastrointestinal health.

    "abstract": "Biogenic amines (BAs) are frequently present in traditionally fermented salted foods. In this study, a Tetragenococcus halophilus strain (MJ4) with no BA-producing ability was isolated from a fish (anchovy) sauce. Strain MJ4 did not produce BAs from supplied precursors and no BA-producing genes were identified in its genome. Bacterial community analysis showed that in non-inoculated saeu-jeot (shrimp sauce) fermentation, Tetragenococcus predominated after 82 days, while in strain MJ4-inoculated saeu-jeot, Tetragenococcus predominated during the entire fermentation. Strain MJ4 repressed the growth of T. muriaticus, a known BA producer, during fermentation, but metabolite analysis demonstrated that metabolite profiles, including amino acids, were similar regardless of MJ4 inoculation. The metabolite analysis also showed that strain MJ4 clearly repressed the formation of cadaverine during fermentation. This study suggests that the use of strain MJ4 as a starter culture in salted fish fermentation may be a good strategy for the reduction of BA formation.",

    "abstract": "Strains of Lactobacillus sakei can be isolated from a variety of sources including meat, fermented sausages, sake, sourdough, sauerkraut or kimchi. Selected strains are widely used as starter cultures for sausage fermentation. Recently we have demonstrated that control about the lactic microbiota in fermenting sausages is achieved rather by pairs or strain sets than by single strains. In this work we characterized the pan genome of L. sakei to enable exploitation of the genomic diversity of L. sakei for the establishment of assertive starter strain sets. We have established the full genome sequences of nine L. sakei strains from different sources of isolation and included in the analysis the genome of L. sakei 23K. Comparative genomics revealed an accessory genome comprising about 50% of the pan genome and different lineages of strains with no relation to their source of isolation. Group and strain specific differences could be found, which namely referred to agmatine and citrate metabolism. The presence of genes encoding metabolic pathways for fructose, sucrose and trehalose as well as gluconate in all strains suggests a general adaptation to plant/sugary environments and a life in communities with other genera. Analysis of the plasmidome did not reveal any specific mechanisms of adaptation to a habitat. The predicted differences of metabolic settings enable prediction of partner strains, which can occupy the meat environment to a large extent and establish competitive exclusion of autochthonous microbiota. This may assist the development of a new generation of meat starter cultures containing L. sakei strains.",

    "title": "Microbial Ecology of Fermented Vegetables and Non-Alcoholic Drinks and Current Knowledge on Their Impact on Human Health.",
    "abstract": "Fermented foods are currently experiencing a re-discovery, largely driven by numerous health benefits claims. While fermented dairy, beer, and wine (and other alcoholic fermented beverages) have been the subject of intensive research, other plant-based fermented foods that are in some case widely consumed (kimchi/sauerkraut, pickles, kombucha) have received less scientific attention. In this chapter, the current knowledge on the microbiology and potential health benefits of such plant-based fermented foods are presented. Kimchi is the most studied, characterized by primarily acidic fermentation by lactic acid bacteria. Anti-obesity and anti-hypertension properties have been reported for kimchi and other pickled vegetables. Kombucha is the most popular non-alcoholic fermented drink. Kombucha's microbiology is remarkable as it involves all fermenters described in known fermented foods: lactic acid bacteria, acetic acid bacteria, fungi, and yeasts. While kombucha is often hyped as a \"super-food,\" only antioxidant and antimicrobial properties toward foodborne pathogens are well established; and it is unknown if these properties incur beneficial impact, even in vitro or in animal models. The mode of action that has been studied and demonstrated the most is the probiotic one. However, it can be expected that fermentation metabolites may be prebiotic, or influence host health directly. To conclude, plant-based fermented foods and drinks are usually safe products; few negative reports can be found, but more research, especially human dietary intervention studies, are warranted to substantiate any health claim.",

    "title": "Yogurt and other fermented foods as sources of health-promoting bacteria.",
    "abstract": "Increased consumption of yogurt, kefir, and other fermented foods has been driven, in part, by the health benefits these products may confer. Epidemiological studies have shown that the consumption of fermented foods is associated with reduced risks of type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and heart disease, along with improved weight management. The microorganisms present in these foods are suggested to contribute to these health benefits. Among these are the yogurt starter culture organisms Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp bulgaricus as well as Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus strains that are added for their probiotic properties. In contrast, for other fermented foods, such as sauerkraut, kimchi, and miso, fermentation is initiated by autochthonous microbes present in the raw material. In both cases, for these fermentation-associated microbes to influence the gut microbiome and contribute to host health, they must overcome, at least transiently, colonization resistance and other host defense factors. Culture and culture-independent methods have now clearly established that many of these microbes present in fermented dairy and nondairy foods do reach the gastrointestinal tract. Several studies have shown that consumption of yogurt and other fermented foods may improve intestinal and extraintestinal health and might be useful in improving lactose malabsorption, treating infectious diarrhea, reducing the duration and incidence of respiratory infections, and enhancing immune and anti-inflammatory responses.",

Profiles of metabolites and microbial community in kimchi were remarkably different from those on the first day of fermentation according to MCS used. Kimchi inoculated with MCS5 or MCS10 had relatively higher levels of lactic acid, leucine, propanedioic acid, serine, glycerol, erythritol, and sorbitol but lower levels of butanedioic acid, glyceric acid, myo-inositol, xylose, fructose, and talose compared to control kimchi or kimchi inoculated with MCS1. Microbial communities of kimchi inoculated with MCS1, MCS5, and MCS10 were characterized by high ratios of Leuconostoc, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Lactobacillus brevis, respectively. The microbial community of kimchi formed on the first day of fermentation was stable for 50 days, suggesting that microbial communities containing multiple microorganisms can be used as starters to obtain desired quality of kimchi.",

    "abstract": "Fermented foods are considered as an integral part of the global human diet. Fermented foods also have unique microbial communities such as bacteria, archaea, fungi, and viruses that are essential to the fermentation process and affect final product characteristics. Despite the ecological importance of virus, little is known about the diversity and ecological role of virus in the food ecosystem. In this study, the viral and host bacterial communities from 10 representative samples of Korean and Chinese kimchi were analyzed in triplicate using next-generation sequencing technology. The overall structures of bacterial and viral communities were dominated by lactic acid bacteria in phylum Firmicutes and bacteriophages in order Caudovirales, respectively. For the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) viruses, bacteriophage in family Microviridae were dominant in Korean kimchi. After correction for multiple comparisons using false discovery rate (FDR, P < 0.05), the relative abundances of 6 bacterial taxa and 33 viral host taxa at the genus level were significantly different between Korean and Chinese kimchi. Notably, in beta-diversity analysis, viral communities were much more clearly separated according to their geographical origin (PERMANOVA pseudo-F = 11.57, P < 0.001 in Bray-Curtis PCoA) than bacterial communities (pseudo-F = 4.75, P < 0.001 in unweighted UniFrac PCoA). Thus, viral metagenomics represents a potentially useful in-depth analytical method for determining the geographical origins of fermented foods.",

The bacterial community in five myeolchi-jeot (Engraulis japonica), five meongge-jeot (Halocynthia roretzi), and six saeu-jeot (Acetes japonicas) produced in South Korea was analyzed by barcoded pyrosequencing targeting the V1/V2 hyper-variable regions of the 16S rRNA gene. All samples were dominated by the phyla Firmicutes, which represented 67.7% (SD = 27.2%) of the population. Tetragenococcus halophilus and Tetragenococcus muriaticus were the predominant species in myeolchi-jeot. The LABs, Lactobacillus sakei, Lactobacillus curvatus, and Weissella koreensis were the predominant species in meongge-jeot. In myeolchi-jeot and meongge-jeot, the bacterial communities within samples were consistent in their predominance, however each of saeu-jeot samples had inter-individual variety in the bacterial community leading to the difficulties of standardization for the commercial production of saeu-jeot. The results of this study will conclusively help to expand our basic knowledge of jeotgal and the related microorganisms involved in food fermentation.",

    "abstract": "Despite previous inquiry into the fermentative bacterial community of kimchi, there has been little insight into the impacts of starting ingredients on the establishment and dynamics of the microbial community. Recently some industrial producers have begun to utilize vegan production methods that omit fermented seafood ingredients. The community-level impacts of this change are unknown. In this study, we investigated the differences in the taxonomic composition of the microbial communities of non-vegan kimchi and vegan kimchi prepared through quick fermentation at room temperature. In addition to tracking the community dynamics over the fermentation process, we looked at the impact of the constituent ingredients and the production facility environment on the microbial community of fermenting kimchi. Our results indicate that the bacterial community of the prepared vegan product closely mirrors the progression and final structure of the non-vegan final product. We also found that room temperature-fermented kimchi differs minimally from more traditional cold-fermented kimchi. Finally, we found that the bacterial community of the starting ingredients show a low relative abundance of the lactic acid bacteria in fermented kimchi, whereas the production facility is dominated by these bacteria.",

The production of foods such as yogurt and cultured milk, wine and beer, sauerkraut and kimchi, and fermented sausage were initially valued because of their improved shelf life, safety, and organoleptic properties. It is increasingly understood that fermented foods can also have enhanced nutritional and functional properties due to transformation of substrates and formation of bioactive or bioavailable end-products. Many fermented foods also contain living microorganisms of which some are genetically similar to strains used as probiotics. Although only a limited number of clinical studies on fermented foods have been performed, there is evidence that these foods provide health benefits well-beyond the starting food materials.",

Strain CBA1132 had nine putative CRISPRs and the genome contained genes encoding metal resistance determinants: copper-translocating P-type ATPase (CtpA), arsenical pump-driving ATPase (ArsA), arsenate reductase (ArsC), and arsenical resistance operon repressor (ArsR). Strain CBA1132 was related to Halobacterium noricense, with 99.2% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity. Based on the comparative genomic analysis, strain CBA1132 has distinctly evolved; moreover, essential genes related to nitrogen metabolism were only detected in the genome of strain CBA1132 among the reported genomes in the genus Halobacterium.

    "abstract": "Viruses are recognized as the most abundant biological components on Earth, and they regulate the structure of microbial communities in many environments. In soil and marine environments, microorganism-infecting phages are the most common type of virus. Although several types of bacteriophage have been isolated from fermented foods, little is known about the overall viral assemblages (viromes) of these environments. In this study, metagenomic analyses were performed on the uncultivated viral communities from three fermented foods, fermented shrimp, kimchi, and sauerkraut. Using a high-throughput pyrosequencing technique, a total of 81,831, 70,591 and 69,464 viral sequences were obtained from fermented shrimp, kimchi and sauerkraut, respectively. Moreover, 37 to 50% of these sequences showed no significant hit against sequences in public databases. There were some discrepancies between the prediction of bacteriophages hosts via homology comparison and bacterial distribution, as determined from 16S rRNA gene sequencing. These discrepancies likely reflect the fact that the viral genomes of fermented foods are poorly represented in public databases. Double-stranded DNA viral communities were amplified from fermented foods by using a linker-amplified shotgun library. These communities were dominated by bacteriophages belonging to the viral order Caudovirales (i.e., Myoviridae, Podoviridae, and Siphoviridae). This study indicates that fermented foods contain less complex viral communities than many other environmental habitats, such as seawater, human feces, marine sediment, and soil.",

    "abstract": "While high sodium intake is a well-established risk factor for cardiovascular disease, its specific association with prediabetes remains unclear, particularly in Asian populations. We aimed to investigate the association between dietary sodium intake and prediabetes prevalence in a large-scale Korean cohort. This cross-sectional study analyzed 57,165 adults without diabetes from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) 2010-2018. Dietary sodium was assessed via a 24-hour recall. We evaluated associations using multivariable-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) across sodium octiles and the WHO threshold (≥2.0 g/day, salt ≥5.1 g/day). Restricted cubic splines (RCS) were used to characterize dose-response patterns. Prediabetes prevalence rose from 22.9% in the lowest sodium octile (≤ 1.4 g/day) to 33.3% in the highest (> 6.2 g/day). Using the WHO threshold, sodium intake ≥2.0 g/day was associated with greater odds of prediabetes (crude OR 1.417, 95% CI 1.357-1.479; p <0.001), which remained significant after adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, and clinical risks (hypertension, dyslipidemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, renal failure, thyroid disease, cancer, and current smoking) (OR 1.151, 95% CI 1.093-1.212; p <0.001). RCS analysis identified a significant non-linear dose-response pattern (p-nonlinearity < 0.01), where risk peaked at approximately 3-4 g/day of sodium (7.6-10.2 g/day salt). Sensitivity analysis showed this association was independent of potassium intake (R = 0.63). Subgroup analysis by BMI revealed divergent patterns, with a nearly linear increase in the underweight group and a U-shaped trend in the overweight group. Annual trends (2010-2018) showed a significant decline in median sodium intake from 3.8 g/day to 2.7 g/day (P-trend < 0.001). Higher dietary sodium intake is independently associated with an increased prevalence of prediabetes in Korean adults. The observed risk threshold and dose-response plateau suggest that sodium moderation, specifically aiming below the 3-4 g/day range, may be a vital strategy for preventing glycemic dysregulation alongside blood pressure control.",

However, their population-level time trends and between-year differences in cross-sectional associations remain underexplored.AimsThis study examined secular trends in physical activity and diet quality among Korean adults from 2018 to 2021 and assessed whether the cross-sectional association between adherence to WHO physical activity guidelines and diet quality varied across survey years.MethodsData were drawn from 18,976 adults aged 19-79 years participating in the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Physical activity was assessed using the Korean version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form and classified according to the WHO guideline (≥150 min/week). Diet quality was measured using the Korean Healthy Eating Index (KHEI). Logistic regression was used to examine the association between physical activity adherence and higher diet quality, adjusting for age, gender, smoking, alcohol use, and body mass index. Meta-regression evaluated the between-year variation in the cross-sectional association.ResultsPhysical activity levels remained stable across survey years, whereas diet quality significantly declined (",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to examine the association between socioeconomic status (SES) and early- and late-onset type 2 diabetes (T2D), evaluate the mediating role of a healthy lifestyle in these associations, and further explore the contribution of various risk factors to different types of T2D. This study analyzed data from US NHANES, and Korean KNHANES, encompassing 20,655 US, and 26,575 Korean adults. SES was categorised as high, middle, or low based on income, education, employment, and insurance. A healthy lifestyle score included nonsmoking, no heavy drinking, regular physical activity, and a high-quality diet. Early-onset T2D was defined as diagnosis before age 40. In NHANES, early-onset T2D prevalence was 1.35 %, rising from 0.85 % (high SES) to 2.41 % (low SES); late-onset prevalence was 5.63 %, with similar SES gradients. Comparable patterns emerged in KNHANES. Low SES consistently increased the risk of early-onset T2D, with stronger associations observed compared to late-onset T2D. A healthy lifestyle only mediated the relationship between SES and late-onset T2D. In early-onset T2D, a healthy lifestyle did not have a significant protective effect. The strength of the associations between the risk factors for early-onset T2D was generally greater than that for late-onset T2D, especially for obesity and family history of diabetes. Low SES is a stronger risk factor for early-onset T2D, with lifestyle interventions proving insufficient to mitigate risk. Public health efforts should prioritize addressing social determinants, early screening, and targeted education for vulnerable youth, particularly those with low SES, obesity, or a family history of diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Unhealthy lifestyles are strongly associated with the development of cardiometabolic diseases and the risk of all-cause mortality. We hypothesized that unhealthy lifestyles including poor diet contribute to the development of cardiometabolic diseases. This study aimed to investigate the incidence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and its clustering components in relation to diet and lifestyle risk factors in Korean population. At baseline, all participants (n = 2000) completed a general health-related questionnaire, provided blood samples, and underwent health examinations. Lifestyle factors were investigated including smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, sleep, dietary quality, and weight status. Cox proportional hazard regression was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of primary endpoints: MetS events and their clustering components. A total of 1697 participants (mean age: 43.8 ± 0.2 years) were included, of whom 72.4% (n = 1228) were women. Compared to the healthy group, unhealthy participants had a significant HR value of abdominal obesity for lifestyle factors (HRs: 1.937, 95% CI: 1.335-2.810). No significant differences were observed between MetS and other clustering components. After adjusting for covariates, the lowest quintile of vitamin C (HRs: 1.553, 95% CI: 1.153-2.091), fiber (HRs: 1.409, 95% CI: 1.035-1.919) and vegetable intake (HRs: 1.300, 95% CI: 1.008-1.678) were significantly associated with abdominal obesity incidence compared with the highest quintile. Adherence to healthy lifestyle factors and dietary factors, such as high intakes of vitamin C and vegetables, were negatively associated with the incidence of abdominal obesity among the MetS components in Korean adults.",

    "abstract": "Weight control methods may impact anxiety symptoms, yet few studies have examined these associations among Korean adults. Using nationally representative 2022 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) data from 3251 non-pregnant adults aged 19-80 years, we analyzed associations between GAD-7 scores and (1) individual weight control methods, (2) total number of methods used, and (3) latent classes derived from latent class analysis (LCA), stratified by sex and weight status. In addition, we examined longitudinal prevalence trends in weight control methods and GAD-7 from 1998 to 2023. Models were adjusted for demographic and health factors including drinking alcohol, smoking, hypertension, high cholesterol, and diabetes. A dose-response relationship was observed between the number of weight control methods used and GAD-7 scores across most subgroups. Specific methods-including fasting, over-the-counter pills, dietary supplements and mono diets-were significantly associated with elevated GAD-7 risk, particularly among underweight or normal-weight groups. LCA revealed four subgroups (diet-focused healthy control group, exercise-focused healthy control group, mixed diet and medication group, and skipping meals-centered group), with those centered on skipping meals showing a higher risk of anxiety among men, whereas those using mixed diet and medication weight control methods exhibited a lower risk among women and underweight individuals. This study's comprehensive, stratified approach and subgroup identification provide novel insights into the complex interplay between specific weight control methods and GAD risk among Korean adults. The findings underscore the importance of tailored public health interventions addressing both physical and mental health in weight management.",

    "abstract": "Frailty represents a critical aging-related condition, but evidence on how different sources of vitamin C relate to frailty risk remains limited. Thus, this study aimed to examine the relationship between frailty risk and sources of vitamin C intake (dietary, including fruit and vegetable (FV) vs. supplemental) among Korean adults. We analyzed data from 9478 adults in the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES 2018-2019). Frailty was assessed using a modified Fried phenotype. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to calculate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for frailty according to vitamin C intake source. More than 60% of participants had inadequate FV intake. Significant associations were observed primarily in women. Increased FV intake (OR = 0.44, 95% CI = 0.264-0.731, comparing the highest intake group (fourth quartile, Q4) vs. the lowest intake group (first quartile, Q1)) for dietary vitamin C intake (OR = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.393-0.914, Q4 vs. Q1) and vitamin C intake from FV (OR = 0.54, 95% CI = 0.348-0.851, Q4 vs. Q1), was significantly associated with a lower risk of frailty. Women with inadequate FV intake had a higher risk of frailty (OR = 2.06, 95% CI = 1.34-3.16) compared to those with adequate intake, regardless of vitamin C supplement use. In contrast, vitamin C supplementation was not significantly associated with frailty risk in either men or women. A higher intake of FV and dietary vitamin C, but not supplemental vitamin C, was associated with a lower risk of frailty, particularly among women. These findings suggest that improving overall diet quality through increased FV consumption may be more effective for frailty prevention than relying on single-nutrient supplementation.",

    "abstract": "The prevalence of diabetes has rapidly increased for East Asian immigrant populations, exceeding rates in East Asian populations in their home countries and the general population of host countries. The increased risk highlights the complex interplay between genetic predisposition and socio-cultural environmental factors associated with migration. Managing diabetes and navigating unfamiliar healthcare systems are challenging for immigrant populations underscoring the need for research on barriers and effective targeted strategies. Identify barriers to best diabetes management practices and effective interventions among East Asian immigrant populations. Studies were identified through PUBMED, OVID MEDLINE, CINAHL COMPLETE and SCOPUS databases utilising Arksey and O'Malley's framework. Peer-reviewed, English reports between January 2010 and August 2024 relating to challenges and barriers of best management practices among adult East Asian immigrants and interventions that facilitated management were identified. Studies of people with type 1 or gestational diabetes and those <18 years old were excluded. Of 576 articles screened, 18 studies meeting the criteria were included in this review. Twelve studies included Chinese immigrants, 13 studies were from the United States, including six among American-Korean immigrants, three were from Australia and two from Canada. Barriers to best diabetes management practices identified from observational studies were themed as relating to (1) 'Cultural Views' (diabetes, diet, medication, traditional remedies, health professional hierarchy and family roles); (2) 'Immigration Challenges' (communication, communication, transport, financial, time constraints, emotional distress and dissatisfaction with Western healthcare systems). Randomised controlled trials (n = 2) and single-group trials (n = 6) reported on effective interventions that improved self-management and/or cardiometabolic risk factors, focusing on self-management (n = 3), nutritional (n = 4) and social media (n = 1) educational programmes. Barriers to best diabetes management practices included clashes with cultural views, immigration-related challenges and dissatisfaction with Western healthcare systems. Effective interventions were mostly associated with culturally-tailored, didactic and bilingual diabetes education programmes.",

    "abstract": "Dietary factors play an important role in modifying cancer risk. This study aimed to assess the proportion of cancer incidence and mortality in Korea attributable to dietary factors from 2015 to 2030. We estimated the population-attributable fraction (PAF) of cancer incidence and mortality using dietary intake levels, exposure rates, and relative risks (RRs). Intake and exposure rates were derived from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, assuming a 15-year latency. RRs were obtained from meta-analyses of Korean cohort and case- control studies. In 2020, 6.08% of cancer cases and 5.70% of deaths in Korea were attributable to dietary factors. High salted vegetable intake (2.12% for incidence and 1.78% for deaths) and low intake of non-starchy vegetables and fruits (1.92 and 2.34%, respectively) were major contributors. However, high intakes of red meat and processed meat showed low PAFs, each less than 1%. The projected PAF for cancer attributable to high salted vegetable intake is expected to decrease substantially to 1.17% in 2030. In contrast, the PAF linked to low intake of non-starchy vegetables and fruits is projected to remain relatively stable. Our findings provide evidence that dietary factors make a substantial contribution to cancer incidence and mortality in Korea. This study highlights that reducing salted vegetable intake and encouraging a diet rich in non-starchy vegetables and fruits may support cancer prevention efforts. Continuous monitoring of dietary trends remains crucial for reducing the cancer burden.",

    "abstract": "Ageism and age-related discrimination are growing public health concerns that can have detrimental effects on the health of older adults. However, their association with nutritional health remains unexplored. This study explored the association between age discrimination and nutritional risk among older adults in Republic of Korea. This study is a cross-sectional analysis of the 2023 National Survey of Older Korean. 9951 adults aged ≥ 65 years from the 2023 National Survey of Older Koreans. Age discrimination was assessed based on the reported experiences in six everyday settings: public transportation; commercial facilities; public institutions; healthcare facilities; workplaces; and family. Nutritional status was measured using the Nutrition Screening Initiative and categorized into low; moderate; and high nutritional risk groups. Multinomial logistic regression models were used to determine the association between age discrimination and nutritional risk and estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The mean age of participants was 74.0 years. Among the participants, 73.7% reported no age discrimination, whereas 15.4%, 6.0%, and 4.9% experienced age discrimination in one; two; and three or more settings, respectively. After adjusting for socio-demographic characteristics and health factors, compared to individuals who did not experience age discrimination, those who experienced discrimination in one, two, or three or more dimensions had 1.40-fold (95% CI: 1.17-1.69), 1.46-fold (95% CI: 1.13-1.89), and 1.89-fold (95% CI: 1.44-2.48) higher odds of being at high nutritional risk, respectively. Age discrimination exposure may be a risk factor for poor nutritional health in older adults. Policy efforts are needed to reduce age-related discrimination and stigmatization and promote equitable conditions for healthy aging.",

A total of 44,471 participants aged 40-69 years and without any liver disease at baseline were included. Dairy intake for milk, yogurt, and cheese was evaluated using a validated food frequency questionnaire. MASLD was defined by the fatty liver index (FLI) ≥60. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI), with adjustments for sociodemographic, lifestyle, and dietary factors. During an average follow-up of 4.5 years, 760 incident MASLD cases occurred in men and 786 in women. Higher total dairy consumption was associated with a lower risk of MASLD in men. Specifically, those with the highest intake of milk and yogurt had a significantly lower risk compared to those with the lowest intake (total dairy consumption, HR 0.79 [95% CI 0.61-0.98]; milk, HR 0.74 [95% CI 0.57-0.96]; yogurt, HR 0.79 [95% CI 0.64-0.97]). No significant associations were observed for cheese consumption or among women. These findings indicate a potential inverse association between milk and yogurt intake and MASLD risk in Korean men, but not in women, suggesting sex-specific dietary influences on liver health. Given the observational design, causal inference cannot be made.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the risk of fetal malformation in pregnant women with pregestational diabetes mellitus based on pre-pregnancy fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels. This cohort study used the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment (HIRA) database, including 5,687 women with pre-pregnancy diabetes and FPG measurements within one year before conception. Subjects were grouped into three glycemic level categories: low (FPG < 100 mg/dL [< 5.5 mmol/L]), moderate (FPG: 100-125 mg/dL [5.6-6.9 mmol/L]), and high (FPG ≥ 126 mg/dL [≥ 7.0 mmol/L]). The low glycemic group was divided into four subgroups based on FPG levels. The relative risks of fetal malformations were calculated using multivariable analysis compared to a reference group (FPG < 84 mg/dL [< 4.7 mmol/L]). Fetal malformation rates were 10% in the low, 13.6% in the moderate, and 18.6% in the high glycemic groups (P < 0.001). Teratogenic risks were 1.3 times higher in the moderate glycemic group and 1.8 times higher in the high glycemic group compared to the reference group. The high glycemic group had 2.5 times greater risk of cardiac malformations and 3.3 times greater risk of skeletal malformations. Preconceptional FPG levels ≥ 100 mg/dL [≥ 5.5 mmol/L] in women with pregestational diabetes elevate the risk of fetal malformations, especially cardiac and skeletal malformations at FPG levels ≥ 126 mg/dL [≥ 7.0 mmol/L].",

    "abstract": "Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) increases the risk of dementia. Reducing modifiable lifestyle-related risk factors can help prevent cognitive decline in patients with MCI. We examined whether a multidomain intervention using a mobile application can prevent cognitive decline in patients with MCI. The trial is designed in accordance with the CONSORT Statement. We conducted an assessor-blind, randomized controlled trial. Patients with MCI, aged over 60 years and presenting with at least one modifiable risk factor for dementia, were recruited from three dementia centers in Gangwon-do, Korea, and outpatient clinics at Chuncheon Sacred Heart Hospital. Participants were randomly assigned to either the intervention group or the control group in a 1:1 ratio. Each participant received a 52-week intervention. The intervention group used a mobile application to manage their diet and physical activity at least three times per week, while the control group received general dietary and physical activity recommendations twice a year. The primary outcome was the change in cognitive function measured based on the mini-mental state examination in the Korean version of the CERAD assessment packet (MMSE-KC) score. Between October 2020 and September 2021, 84 people were screened, and 80 participants were randomly assigned to either the control or intervention group (intervention group = 42, control group = 38). Participants in both groups underwent a post-baseline assessment and their data were included in the analysis. We found a positive effect of the multidomain intervention using a mobile application on the change in cognitive function score in the intervention group compared to the control group at the 52-week follow-up. The MMSE-KC (F = 10.6, p < .001) and modified Boston Naming test (F = 8.3, p < .01) scores were significantly higher in the intervention group than in the control group. The results suggest that a multidomain mobile application intervention could help improve cognition in patients with MCI.The study protocol was prospectively registered with the Clinical Research Information Service (CRIS, Republic of Korea; KCT0008315) on March 16, 2023.

    "abstract": "A plant-based diet is associated with all-cause and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality, but the associations might differ by plant qualities. We examined the associations between the plant-based diet index (PDI) and mortality. Adults with 24-hour dietary recall from the 2007-2015 Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (KNHANES), who were eligible for and linked to national mortality records through 2019, were included (n = 44,291). Three PDIs were calculated: overall PDI (all plant foods), healthful PDI (hPDI, healthful plant foods), and unhealthful PDI (uPDI, unhealthful plant foods), with higher scores for respective plant foods and animal foods reverse-scored. A weighted Cox proportional hazards model estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for mortality. During follow-up (median 8.3-year), 2,302 deaths were identified. For all-cause mortaltiy, HRs (95% CIs) were 0.77 (0.64-0.93) for overall PDI, 0.82 (0.68-0.99) for hPDI, and 1.17 (0.98-1.39) for uPDI in the fifth versus first quintile (P-trend: <0.001, 0.035, 0.031). For CVD mortality, corresponding HRs were 0.60 (0.40-0.90), 0.63 (0.42-0.94), and 1.90 (1.32-2.75). Adherence to an overall PDI and hPDI was associated with a lower risk of all-cause and CVD mortality, while uPDI was associated with a higher risk.",

    "abstract": "This review aimed to elucidate the characteristics of dysphagia and age-related swallowing changes (presbyphagia) in older adults and to comprehensively examine assessment tools and standardized meal management strategies applicable in community settings to propose effective meal management strategies for healthy longevity. Domestic and international literatures were analyzed regarding the definition and causes of dysphagia, physiological and structural characteristics and clinical impacts of presbyphagia, assessment and diagnostic tools Korea version of EAT-10 (K-EAT-10) and Korea version of Dysphagia Risk Assessment for the Community-dwelling Elderly (K-DRACE), and the International Dysphagia Diet Standardization Initiative (IDDSI). Dysphagia compromises safe swallowing and nutritional intake in older adults, leading to serious complications, such as aspiration pneumonia, dehydration, malnutrition, sarcopenia, and reduced quality of life. The K-EAT-10 and K-DRACE proved effective for rapid screening of dysphagia risk in community-dwelling older adults. Moreover, texture-modified meals and viscosity adjustments based on the IDDSI standards are useful for reducing the risk of aspiration and improving nutrient intake. Meals can be classified as liquidized, minced, chopped, or regular, allowing for individualized management. Presbyphagia is a multidimensional problem, and the integrated use of assessment tools and standardized meals is crucial. Community-based dysphagia management programs and collaboration among dietitians and healthcare professionals are needed to improve the nutritional status and quality of life of older adults.",

    "abstract": "Dietary quality is a modifiable determinant of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, evidence on the Korean Healthy Eating Index (KHEI) and sex-specific differences in its association with T2DM risk remains limited. This study is to examine the longitudinal association between KHEI and incident T2DM in Korean adults, with a focus on potential sex differences. We analyzed 56,000 adults (37,684 women and 18,316 men) from the Health Examinee cohort of the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study. Dietary intake was assessed using a validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire, and KHEI scores were constructed based on national guidelines. Incident T2DM was defined using physician diagnosis, treatment history, or biochemical criteria. Cox proportional hazards models and restricted cubic spline analyses were applied to evaluate associations, with adjustments for demographic, lifestyle, and clinical covariates. Over a median follow-up of 4.2 years, 2,252 women and 1,776 men developed T2DM. Women in the highest quartile of KHEI had a 18% lower risk of T2DM compared with those in the lowest quartile (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.82, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.71-0.93;  Higher diet quality, as measured by the KHEI, was associated with a reduced risk of T2DM in women but not in men, suggesting sex-specific effects of dietary patterns on diabetes prevention. These findings highlight the need for tailored nutritional strategies that consider biological and behavioral differences between women and men in Korea.",

Therefore, study analyzed OH prevalence and risk according to renal function decline. A community-based cohort study was conducted using data from the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study (KoGES). OH prevalence was assessed at baseline and at a 2-year follow-up across three estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) categories: high (≥90 mL/min/1.73 m2, G1), moderate (60-89 mL/min/1.73 m2, G2), and low (<60 mL/min/1.73 m2, G3). Among 9,597 participants, baseline OH, 2-year OH, and persistent OH were evaluated within each eGFR group: high (n = 6,743), moderate (n = 2,758), and low (n = 96). The low eGFR group demonstrated the highest prevalence of baseline OH (n = 52, p = 0.024) and 2-year OH (n = 42, p = 0.002). This group also exhibited the largest decline in systolic blood pressure at both baseline and follow-up. In adjusted logistic regression, participants aged <50 years with low eGFR had 3.54-fold higher odds of OH (p = 0.035). Additionally, adherence to a low-sodium diet was associated with increased 2-year OH prevalence across groups (p = 0.001). The low eGFR group showed a higher baseline and follow-up OH prevalence. A low-sodium diet was also associated with elevated OH risk, underscoring the need for careful dietary management in patients with CKD.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to develop and validate a Dietary Practices and Food Safety Literacy Scale comprehensively assessing competencies among Korean older adults in healthy dietary practices, hygiene, and food safety. Item development was informed by a literature review, national dietary guidelines, and existing literacy frameworks. Content validity was reviewed by a 10-member expert panel using the Delphi method. Construct validity was tested using exploratory factor analyses (EFA) and confirmatory factor analyses (CFA), and reliability was assessed through Cronbach's α, composite reliability (CR), and average variance extracted (AVE). EFA identified three factors-management, decision-making, and moderation competencies-comprising 13 items. Internal consistency was acceptable (α = 0.69-0.83), and CFA supported the three-factor structure (CFI = 0.919, RMSEA = 0.087). CR values exceeded 0.70, and AVE were close to or exceeded the recommended threshold. The scale demonstrates sound psychometric properties and provides a practical tool for identifying competency gaps in Dietary Practices and Food Safety Literacy. Its application may guide tailored health education and community-based interventions to promote healthy aging and support public health strategies in aging societies. By translating health information literacy into measurable, behavior-oriented domains, this tool bridges the gap between theoretical constructs and practical assessment. It can be incorporated into routine health monitoring, enabling policymakers and practitioners to design evidence-based interventions that enhance older adults' dietary self-management and food safety awareness.",

    "abstract": "Chronic low back pain (cLBP) is shaped by multiple lifestyle factors, yet models with practical behavioral cutoffs remain scarce. This study developed a machine learning model to identify key lifestyle factors and specific thresholds linked to cLBP in adults aged 50 and older, using data from 5607 participants in the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Machine learning algorithms were trained and validated, with performance assessed via AUROC and SHAP for interpretability. The logistic regression model performed best (AUROC = 0.721, 95% CI: 0.699-0.742). SHAP analysis revealed that higher cLBP risk was associated with older age, female gender, prolonged sitting (≥ 6 h/day), low walking frequency (< 4-5 times/week), infrequent strength training (< 1 time/week), moderate-intensity work, elevated stress, and smoking over five packs lifetime. Diet also mattered: cLBP risk rose among those dining out less than ~2.2 times/week, consuming under 2.9 servings/day of protein, or with carbohydrate intake outside 55%-65% of total energy. These practical cutoffs can help clinicians identify high-risk individuals through simple assessments, guiding tailored interventions in physical activity, diet, smoking cessation, and stress management to prevent cLBP.",

    "abstract": "The validity of 24-h dietary recalls (24HR) has not been well established in older adults, particularly among Asian populations and for Asian-style meals. This study aimed to assess the validity of 24HRs in free-living older Korean adults by comparison with weighed food intakes in a 1-d feeding study. A total of 119 adults aged 60 y and older (mean age: 72.2 ± 8.0 y) consumed 3 self-served meals, during which their food intake was discreetly weighed. On the next day, a 24HR interview was conducted either in person or through an online video call. The proportions of matches and exclusions and number of intrusions were assessed. The mean difference and ratio of reported and weighed portion sizes and energy and nutrient intakes were calculated. Linear regression was used to examine associations with sex, age, body mass index, education, and interview mode. Participants recalled 71.4% of the foods consumed; however, portion sizes were overestimated [mean ratio: 1.34, 95% CI: (1.33, 1.34)]. Differences between reported and weighed intakes of energy and macronutrients were not statistically significant. Women recalled 75.6% of foods consumed, compared with 65.2% in men (P = 0.0001). Few differences in accuracy were found among other participant characteristics or interview mode regarding portion size or energy and nutrient intakes. Free-living older Korean adults recalled ∼71% of the foods they consumed and tended to overestimate portion sizes, with women reporting food items more accurately than men. Although energy and macronutrient intake estimates were generally accurate, improved methods are needed to enhance food reporting accuracy, particularly among men.

    "title": "The Impact of Chinese Adult's Food Literacy on Healthy Eating Intentions Based on the Planned Behaviour Theory.",
    "abstract": "Unhealthy diets are major contributors to obesity and chronic diseases. In 2023, 50.7% of Chinese adults were overweight or obese, underscoring the need to strengthen healthy-eating intentions. We analysed a cross-sectional online survey of 1145 adults (18-64 years) from Henan and Shandong. Moderation was tested using multiple linear regression with mean-centred interaction terms between each Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) construct (attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioural control [PBC]) and each food-literacy component (production, choices, preparation and cooking, intake, disposal). Models were adjusted for age, occupation, marital status, alcohol use, physician-diagnosed chronic disease, and living with family. To address multicollinearity, we performed a ridge-regression robustness check (L2-regularised linear model; λ = 0.02 selected by 10-fold cross-validation; CV-RMSE = 0.483; CV-R The overall food-literacy score did not significantly moderate the associations between attitude, subjective norms, or PBC and healthy-eating intention ( Among adults in Henan and Shandong, the intake component of food literacy strengthened the association between PBC and healthy-eating intention, whereas overall food literacy showed no general moderating effect. Interventions should prioritise intake-related skills (e.g., portion planning, lower-sodium choices and nutrition label use) to enhance perceived behavioural control and, in turn, intention. Given the cross-sectional design, causal inference is limited; longitudinal, capability-building evaluations are warranted.",

    "title": "Frailty and nutritional inadequacy in older Korean adults: A gender-stratified analysis using National Survey Data.",
    "abstract": "While frailty has traditionally been conceptualized through physical decline, it is increasingly recognized as a complex concept encompassing emotional, psychological, and social factors. This study employed a multidimensional framework to investigate the association between nutritional status and frailty levels across genders. In addition, it aims to provide foundational insights for developing targeted dietary and preventive health policies that support interventions tailored to the characteristics of specific older adult populations. This is a cross-sectional study of the 2009-2020 Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in 14,242 participants aged 65 and older. The frailty index was constructed using 41 items. Dietary data were obtained through a 24-hour dietary recall, and adequacy of nutrient intake was evaluated based on the Dietary Reference Intakes for Koreans 2020. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted to examine the association between nutritional status and frailty levels. Among participants, 31.6% were categorized as non-frail, 47.8% as pre-frail, and 20.6% as frail. Women exhibited lower total energy intake and higher frailty prevalence than men. Gender-stratified analyses revealed distinct nutritional patterns: frail men showed a significant decreasing trend in riboflavin intake (P-trend = 0.0012), while frail women had increased carbohydrate (P-trend = 0.005) and decreased fat (P-trend = 0.0032) and riboflavin (P-trend = 0.0062) intake. Frailty significantly associated with iron inadequacy in men (OR=1.49, 95% CI:1.15-1.94; P-trend = 0.0018) and riboflavin inadequacy in women (OR=1.45, 95% CI:1.20-1.74; P-trend<0.0001). Frailty in older adults is associated with multidimensional vulnerabilities-including demographic, behavioral, relational, and nutritional factors-with notable gender differences in nutrient intake patterns. These findings underscore the need for gender-specific and integrated nutritional interventions to effectively prevent frailty and improve quality of life in the elderly population.",

    "abstract": "Dietary patterns are an important research focus for evaluating associations with disease risk. However, studies investigating secular trends in dietary patterns among Korean adults remain limited. Therefore, we aimed to identify the major dietary patterns in the Korean population and to assess how these patterns have changed over the past 16 years. This study included 33,408 men and 46,628 women aged 19 years or older who participated in the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) from 2007 to 2022. Dietary intake was assessed using a single 24-hour dietary recall. Dietary patterns were derived using cluster analysis based on the percentage contribution of 28 food groups to total energy intake. Subgroup analyses were conducted to examine secular trends in dietary patterns by sex and age group. Survey-weighted multivariable logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for cardiometabolic risk factors according to dietary patterns. Three dietary patterns were identified through cluster analysis: (1) Traditional, (2) Red Meat & Alcohol, and (3) Flour-based Foods & Sweets. The overall trend in dietary patterns among Korean adults has undergone a gradual transition from traditional to Westernized dietary patterns. Since 2013, the Flour-based Foods & Sweets pattern has become the most prevalent (p < .0001), and this pattern was more commonly observed aged 19-29 years and among women. After multivariate adjustment, men adhering to the Red Meat & Alcohol pattern had the highest odds of cardiometabolic risk factors, including hyperglycemia (OR = 1.35, 95% CI: 1.24-1.48), high blood pressure (1.33, 1.23-1.45), hypertriglyceridemia (1.16, 1.07-1.26), hypercholesterolemia (1.17, 1.07-1.27), abdominal obesity (1.18, 1.05-1.32), and overall obesity (1.28, 1.18-1.38). In women, adherence to the Flour-based Foods & Sweets Pattern was associated with higher odds of hypercholesterolemia (1.14, 1.08-1.20) and high LDL-cholesterol (1.08, 1.03-1.15). A transition from traditional to Westernized dietary patterns occurred among Korean adults from 2007 to 2022, which may have differential impacts on cardiometabolic health according to sex and age, underscoring the need for tailored nutritional interventions and sex-specific public health strategies.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have reported associations between alcohol consumption patterns and diet quality. However, this study expanded previous knowledge by investigating the relationship between alcohol consumption patterns-categorized by frequency and amount of alcohol consumption-and diet quality, assessed by using the Korean Healthy Eating Index (KHEI), among Korean adults aged 30-64 years. A total of 7885 adults (3469 men and 4416 women) from the 2019-2021 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were included. Drinking patterns were classified based on frequency and quantity, and their association with diet quality was compared to that of abstainers. In both men and women, infrequent heavy drinkers, more frequent moderate/light drinkers, and more frequent heavy drinkers had significantly lower scores for total and fresh fruit intake, and higher scores for calories from sweets and beverages than abstainers. Among women, the odds of being in the lowest KHEI quartile (Q1) compared to the highest (Q4) were significantly higher for infrequent heavy drinkers (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.61; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.08-2.39), more frequent moderate/light drinkers (AOR = 1.65; 95% CI: 1.05-2.58), and more frequent heavy drinkers (AOR = 2.54; 95% CI: 1.44-4.49). These findings suggest that frequent drinking and higher intake per occasion are associated with lower consumption of fresh fruit and poorer overall diet quality. In women, both frequent drinking and high consumption during infrequent drinking occasions were more strongly associated with poor diet quality, highlighting the need for stricter dietary guidance related to alcohol consumption.",

    "abstract": "The Planetary Health Diet (PHD) was developed to address global health and environmental challenges by promoting sustainable and nutritionally adequate eating patterns. This study evaluated adherence to the PHD among Korean adults and examined its association with the Korean Healthy Eating Index (KHEI), with the aim of informing the development of a Korea-specific PHD adherence index. Using data from the 2013-2023 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES), dietary intake of adults aged ≥19 years was analyzed. Adherence was assessed by comparing food group consumption with PHD reference ranges, and KHEI scores were calculated to examine their association with PHD compliance and nutrient intake. Analyses were also stratified by sex to examine differences in intake patterns. Men generally consumed larger quantities and had higher frequencies of intake across most food groups, whereas women consumed more fruits and dairy products. However, both sexes showed insufficient consumption of whole grains, legumes, and nuts, and red meat intake far exceeded the suggested limits. Participants with higher KHEI scores demonstrated greater intake of plant-based proteins and lower intake of red meat and saturated fats. Nutrient profiles also improved with higher KHEI scores. These findings suggest that better diet quality, as indicated by higher KHEI scores, is aligned with more sustainable eating behaviors and that that the KHEI may serve as a practical proxy for assessing adherence to the PHD. However, persistent gaps in whole grain, legume, and nut intake, together with excessive red meat consumption, highlight the need for culturally adapted guidelines and strategies to promote sustainable dietary shifts in Korea.",

    "title": "Differential contributions of cardiovascular health-related lifestyle factors to epigenetic ageing: implications for healthy longevity.",
    "abstract": "Lifestyle and cardiovascular health (CVH) are key determinants of the biological ageing process, which is closely linked to healthy ageing and longevity. Multiple CVH factors may interact and exert combined effects on the biological ageing process; however, studies exploring their collective association, particularly in Asian cohorts, remain limited. In this cross-sectional study, we investigated the relative contributions of CVH-related behaviours (diet, sleep, avoidance of nicotine, and physical activity) and clinical indicators (BMI, blood lipids, blood glucose, and blood pressure) to epigenetic age acceleration (EAA), as well as their collective associations. We included 1940 participants from two large-scale prospective cohorts within the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study. We assessed CVH based on the American Heart Association's Life's Essential 8 and measured five EAA (intrinsic EAA (Horvath DNAmAge acceleration), extrinsic EAA (Hannum DNAmAge acceleration), PhenoAge acceleration, GrimAge2 acceleration, and Dunedin Pace of Ageing Calculated from the Epigenome (DunedinPACE)). We employed quantile-based g-computation to delineate the sex-specific relative contributions of CVH to EAA. Better CVH was associated with lower EAA (ψ, the estimates of collective associations, ranged from - 4.29 to - 0.79, depending on the EAA measure). The CVH components contributing most to lower EAA varied by sex. In males, nicotine avoidance and better glucose contributed most to lower EAA, accounting for 91% and 77% of the overall associations of CVH with lower Grim2AA and DunedinPACE, respectively, whereas better blood glucose accounted for 86% and 94%. In females, physical activity and better glucose or BMI were the greatest contributors to lower EAA. Physical activity accounted for 44% of the CVH-Grim2AA association. Better glucose explained 54% and 50% of the association with Grim2AA and DunedinPACE, respectively. Better BMI contributed 46% to lower PhenoAA. Simultaneous improvements in multiple CVH components were associated with lower EAA, with sex-specific differences in the most influential factors. Tailored health strategies-emphasizing smoking cessation and glucose control for males, and physical activity, glucose control, and weight management for females-may help slow ageing. These findings highlight the need for public and clinical interventions that incorporate sex differences in health behaviours and the potential biological mechanisms of ageing.",

This study aimed to investigate the association between food insecurity and CVH in Korean adults. This study included 14,034 adults aged ≥19 years in the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2019-2021. CVH was defined using the American Heart Association's Life's Simple 7 framework, including smoking status, physical activity, diet, body mass index, total cholesterol, blood pressure, and fasting glucose. Participants were categorized into the food secure or food insecure group based on their survey scores. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to calculate the association between food insecurity and poor CVH. Among the participants, 4.0% belonged to the food insecure group and 96.0% belonged to the food secure group, and 15.3%, 61.4%, and 23.3% of the participants had ideal, intermediate, and poor CVH, respectively. In the multivariate analysis, the odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for poor CVH was 1.32 (1.06-1.64) in food insecure group compared to food secure group. The odds for poor CVH increased as food security status aggravated (p for trend <0.05). Moreover, food insecure group had higher odds of poor status in the following CVH components: smoking and blood pressure. Food insecurity is associated with poor CVH in Korean adults. Specifically, it is associated with current smoking and high blood pressure. Improving food insecurity may help prevent poor CVH in Korea.",

Fish consumption was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire and categorized into four groups: < 2, 2-4, 4-7, and ≥ 7 servings/week. CVD mortality was determined from 2001 to 2021 death records provided by Statistics Korea. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to calculate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for mortality across fish consumption. Restricted cubic spline regressions were conducted to examine nonlinear dose-response relationships between weekly fish consumption and CVD mortality. Among women, higher fish consumption was associated with a lower risk of CVD mortality (≥ 7 servings/week vs. < 2 servings/week: HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.54-1.07, P trend = 0.029). By CVD subtypes, higher fish consumption showed a significant inverse association with the risk of cerebrovascular disease mortality in women. Among men, fish consumption was not significantly associated with mortality risk related to CVD or its subtypes. A significant nonlinear inverse association with overall CVD mortality was observed in women and women with older ages and higher intake of fruits and vegetables showed a stronger association with overall CVD mortality compared to their counterparts. We found that higher fish consumption is associated with a reduced risk of CVD mortality in Korean women. Sex-specific dietary strategies may be necessary for the effective prevention and management of CVD.",

    "abstract": "Many studies have shown that dietary fibre lowers cholesterol levels; however, to our knowledge, no study has examined the relationship between dietary fibre intake and remnant cholesterol, which are known risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Therefore, we aimed to investigate the association between dietary fibre intake and remnant serum cholesterol levels in older Korean adults. We used data from the 2016 to 2021 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, which included 8212 older adults. Serum remnant cholesterol levels were calculated by subtracting the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels from the total cholesterol level. Hyperremnant cholesterolaemia was defined as a serum remnant cholesterol level of ≥ 30 mg/dL. Dietary fibre intake was classified on the basis of adequate intake (AI). A multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the association between dietary fibre intake and remnant serum cholesterol levels. The odds ratio of hyper-remnant cholesterol aemia was 1.26 times higher in older adults with fibre intake below AI than in those with fibre intake above AI (95% confidence interval 1.06-1.48, p < 0.01). This study revealed that dietary fibre intake was inversely associated with serum remnant cholesterol levels in older Korean adults. Therefore, dietary fibre can be considered a novel therapeutic strategy for lowering remnant cholesterol and may benefit older adults at risk of CVD in terms of the prevention and inhibition of progression.",

    "abstract": "Studies suggest a positive association between ultra-processed food (UPF) intake and type 2 diabetes risk. However, studies were primarily conducted in Western populations with diets and disease profiles different from populations living elsewhere. In addition, the dose-response relationship needs to be further elucidated. We conducted an individual-level pooled analysis of three Korean prospective cohorts (n = 72,776). UPF intake (in the percentage of g/d as the main UPF unit) was assessed using validated food frequency questionnaires and categorized according to Nova classification. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We subsequently conducted a meta-analysis of prospective studies, including recent studies from both Western and non-Western populations, to assess the dose-response relationship. In a pooled analysis of Korean cohorts (up to 18 years of follow-up), the highest (vs. lowest) quartile of UPF intake was associated with an increased type 2 diabetes risk (pooled HR [95% CI] = 1.11 [1.02, 1.21] , p-trend = 0.03). The positive association persisted after additional adjustment for BMI, nutritional factors (fiber, sodium, and carbohydrate intakes), or diet quality score. Among individual UPF subgroups, processed meats, ready-to-eat/heat mixed dishes, and ice cream were positively associated with diabetes risk. In a meta-analysis of 17 prospective cohorts, every 10% (of g/d) increment in UPF intake was associated with a 10% (summary RR [95% CI] = 1.10 [1.08, 1.12] ) higher risk in a dose-response fashion. Our meta-evidence supports that higher UPF intake may monotonically increase type 2 diabetes risk.",

    "title": "A higher intake of white-edible-colored fruits and vegetables is associated with lower gastrointestinal cancer risk among Korean adults in a prospective cohort study.",
    "abstract": "Although fruits and vegetables were studied botanically in previous studies, few have examined their associations with gastrointestinal (GI) cancer risk based on color classification. Color is familiar to the public and translates phytochemical science into dietary guidance. We hypothesized that the intake of fruits and vegetables would be differently associated with GI cancer risk by color. This cohort study investigated the association between fruit and vegetable colors and GI cancer risk in 11,286 participants from the Cancer Screenee Cohort, who underwent health check-ups at the National Cancer Center between 2007 and 2021. Dietary data were collected through food frequency questionnaires. A Cox proportional hazards regression model evaluated the association between fruit and vegetable color groups (green, orange/yellow, red/purple, and white) and GI cancer risk. Over a mean follow-up of 8 years, 214 GI cancers (esophageal, gastric, small intestine, liver, pancreatic, and colorectal) were identified. Higher total fruit and vegetable intake was associated with reduced GI cancer risk (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.57, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.38-0.88, P for trend = .013). Among color groups, white-colored fruits and vegetables (HR = 0.64, 95% CI: 0.41-0.99, P for trend = .021), and white-colored fruits (HR = 0.59, 95% CI: 0.38-0.92, P for trend = .021) were associated with a lower risk of GI cancer after fully adjusting for demographic variables, dietary factors, and comorbidities. Findings were consistent across subgroup analyses. No significant associations were found for green, orange/yellow, or red/purple groups. These results suggest that white-colored fruits and vegetables may contribute to GI cancer prevention.",

    "abstract": "Shift work is associated with irregular dietary habits and poor nutritional intake, increasing the risk of chronic diseases. This study aimed to assess dietary quality and nutritional intake according to shift work status among Korean adult workers. Data from 15 121 adult workers aged ≥20 years from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) conducted between 2013 and 2021 were analyzed. Dietary quality was evaluated using the Korean Healthy Eating Index (KHEI), and shift work status was determined by self-reported working hours. Associations between shift work and dietary quality were assessed using multivariable logistic regression, accounting for the complex survey design. Stratified analyses by gender were also conducted. Shift workers showed no significant difference in overall dietary quality compared with day workers (odds ratio [OR] = 0.91; 95% CI, 0.80-1.04). However, shift workers more frequently skipped breakfast (OR = 0.78; 95% CI, 0.68-0.89) and consumed fewer fresh fruits (OR = 0.86; 95% CI, 0.75-0.98), vegetables excluding kimchi/pickles (OR = 0.89; 95% CI, 0.79-0.99), and protein-rich foods (OR = 0.87; 95% CI, 0.77-0.99). Conversely, shift workers had better adherence to recommended sodium intake (OR = 1.19; 95% CI, 1.06-1.34). Gender-stratified analysis revealed lower fruit intake among male shift workers and more frequent breakfast skipping and lower fruit/protein intake among female shift workers. Among Korean adult workers, shift work was associated with unfavorable dietary patterns, characterized by increased breakfast skipping and lower intake of fruits, vegetables, and protein-rich foods. Tailored strategies to improve meal regularity and dietary balance are recommended for managing the health of shift workers.",

    "title": "Relationship Between Autonomous Motivation for Dietary Self-Care Behaviors and Quality of Life in People with Type 2 Diabetes: A Structural Equation Modeling Approach.",
    "abstract": "Diabetes has the most detrimental impact on the dietary freedom of people with type 2 diabetes (T2D), and it is important to facilitate dietary self-care behaviors in people with T2D without impairing quality of life (QOL). Autonomous motivation to perform dietary self-care behaviors could lessen their psychological burden and maintain their QOL. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to identify the relationship between autonomous motivation for dietary self-care behaviors and QOL in people with T2D by establishing a hypothetical model using competence and implementation levels of dietary self-care behaviors as mediating variables. This cross-sectional study recruited participants and collected data from August 2022 to January 2023 using questionnaires assessing autonomous motivation for dietary self-care behaviors, competence and implementation levels of dietary self-care behaviors, and QOL directed toward people with T2D at the outpatient diabetes department of a university hospital. The authors tested the hypothetical model using structural equation modeling (SEM). A total of 223 participants completed the questionnaires. The hypothetical model was modified based on testing the model using SEM. The final model showed a good fit, χ Given that the final model was exploratory due to modifications from the hypothetical model, further validation, including cross-validation using independent samples, should assess the replicability and robustness of the model structure. Based on such validation, interventions to increase autonomous motivation for dietary self-care behaviors in people with T2D may need to be developed and evaluated to improve their QOL.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to explore an association between platelet count and moderate to severe cerebral white matter hyperintensities (MS-cWMH), a key imaging marker of cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD), in individuals with cardiovascular risk factors, hypothesizing that higher platelet counts are associated with increased CSVD severity. A retrospective cross-sectional study analyzed data from 1,011 participants aged ≥45 years at CHA Bundang Medical Center in Seoul, Korea, between 2008 and 2014. Participants were selected based on predefined criteria, including cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., hypertension, hyperlipidemia, smoking) and no history of stroke, and underwent brain MRI and MRA as part of the study protocol. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) was performed to exclude participants with large vessel disease, such as intracranial or extracranial arterial stenosis. A multivariable logistic regression model was constructed to assess the association between platelet count and MS-cWMH, incrementally adjusting for demographic characteristics, cardiovascular risk factors, and imaging features. The study revealed a significant association between platelet count and MS-cWMH. Each increase of 100×10^9/L in platelet count was associated with a 1.37-fold increase in the risk of MS-cWMH (95% CI: 1.06-1.77, p = 0.0168). The association was more pronounced in females, elderly individuals aged 68-85 years, and patients with diabetes and remained robust in multiple sensitivity analyses. Higher platelet counts are significantly associated with an increased risk of MS-cWMH, particularly in specific high-risk populations such as females, elderly individuals aged 68-85 years, and patients with diabetes. Platelet count may serve as a potential biomarker for assessing the risk of CSVD, aiding in the early identification of high-risk individuals for preventive interventions. This finding highlights the potential clinical significance of monitoring platelet counts in high-risk populations. Strategies to reduce high platelet counts, such as antiplatelet therapy (e.g., clopidogrel, aspirin) or lifestyle interventions (e.g., diet and exercise), may help mitigate the risk of MS-cWMH. Further longitudinal studies are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of these interventions in reducing MS-cWMH risk. Additionally, future research should investigate the biological mechanisms linking platelet count to CSVD, particularly the roles of platelet activation, inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of this association.",

    "abstract": "To assess the safety and efficacy of early oral refeeding (ERF) versus delayed refeeding (DRF) in patients with mild post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography pancreatitis (PEP). Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the ERF or DRF group. Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the ERF or DRF group. In the ERF group, feeding began 24 hours after the diagnosis of PEP; in the DRF group, feeding commenced once normal bowel sounds returned and pain had decreased to a visual analog scale score of <2. The diet was advanced from clear fluids to soft foods according to patient tolerance. Refeeding was temporarily halted if the visual analog scale score reached ≥5 points or if intake was refused due to pain. Resumption required normal amylase/lipase levels, pain relief, and bowel movement restoration. Discharge criteria included patient well-being >24 hours post-diet. The primary outcome was PEP hospitalization duration, and secondary outcomes were the incidence of severe acute pancreatitis, readmission rate (<30 days), and PEP-related mortality rate. A total of 80 patients (40 in each ERF and DRF group) were enrolled across nine referral centers. Baseline characteristics, procedural parameters and initial PEP severity were not significantly different between the two groups. Four ERF and three DRF patients had refeeding interruptions. ERF significantly reduced PEP hospitalization duration compared to DRF (2.93±1.59 days vs 3.78±1.97 days: relative risk, 0.75; 95% confidence interval, 0.59 to 0.97; p=0.026). Rates of severe acute pancreatitis, readmission, and mortality/morbidity related to PEP were similar between the two groups. ERF effectively shortens hospitalization in mild PEP patients without increasing safety risks (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT04750044).",

A total of 48,007 individuals from the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study dataset were included in the GWAS. Dietary intake was evaluated using a food frequency questionnaire. To identify genomic loci that interact with specific nutrients influencing hyperuricemia risk, we conducted a GWAS followed by gene-nutrient interaction analyses of genome-wide significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Two SNPs with significant gene-nutrient interactions for specific nutrients were identified: rs113206751 in the Membrane-Associated Ring-CH-Type Finger 1 (MARCH1) gene and rs9393235 in the Neuroblastoma-Associated Transcript 1 (NBAT1) gene near the prolactin (PRL) gene.

This study aimed to characterize the metabolomic profiles and nutrient intake associated with MetS and to examine their relationships in the Ansan-Ansung cohort of the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study (KoGES). Data from 2,306 middle-aged adults (1,109 men and 1,197 women) in the KoGES Ansan-Ansung cohort were analyzed. Plasma metabolites were measured using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, identifying 135 metabolites. Nutrient intake was assessed using a validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire covering 23 nutrients. MetS-associated metabolites and nutrients were identified using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, logistic regression, partial least squares-discriminant analysis, and group least absolute shrinkage and selection operator analysis. Pathway enrichment analysis identified key metabolic pathways, and fixed-effects models were applied to assess metabolite-nutrient relationships based on MetS status. Eleven metabolites, including hexose (FC = 0.95, P = 7.04 × 10 This comprehensive metabolomic analysis of the KoGES Ansan-Ansung cohort revealed distinct metabolic profiles and nutrient intake patterns associated with MetS, highlighting altered metabolite-nutrient relationships and disrupted metabolic pathways. These findings provide new insights into potential associations between metabolic phenotypes and dietary intake, which may help inform individualized dietary approaches related to MetS, such as branched-chain amino acids-restricted diets (valine, isoleucine, leucine), reduced intake of hexose-rich carbohydrates, and modulation of niacin-rich protein sources according to individual metabolic profiles.",

    "abstract": "Chronotype and ultra-processed food (UPF) intake are individually associated with metabolic risk, but their combined effect remains unclear. This study examined the interaction between chronotype and UPF intake in relation to insulin resistance, assessed by the triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index. Data were obtained from 542 adults in the Gangwon Obesity and Metabolic Syndrome (GOMS) Study. Chronotypes were classified into morning, intermediate, and evening types using Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire-based clustering. UPF intake was assessed using a food frequency questionnaire and classified according to the Korean-adapted NOVA classification system. Intake was expressed as a percentage of total energy and divided into quartiles. General linear models were used to examine the interaction between chronotype and UPF intake in relation to the TyG index, with adjustments for relevant covariates. An additional analysis examined the association between TyG quartiles and diabetes prevalence. A significant interaction between UPF intake and chronotype was observed only in the evening-type group ( The association between UPF intake and the TyG index varied by chronotype, with evening types showing greater vulnerability. These findings suggest that biological rhythms may modify the metabolic impact of diet, highlighting the need for personalized prevention strategies.",

These lifestyle-related conditions are intricately linked to sleep patterns, dietary behaviors, and physical activity. This study aimed to examine how sleep duration, energy intake, and physical activity levels-key lifestyle factors-are associated with metabolic syndrome based on the presence or absence of obesity and hypertension among working Korean adults. We analyzed 6,503 working Korean adults aged 20-59 years using cross-sectional data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey covering 2016-2018. This study divided the participants based on their obesity and hypertension status. We assessed the participants' sleep duration on weekdays and weekends, their total dietary energy consumption and macronutrient intake using a 24-h dietary recall method conducted by trained interviewers, and occupational and recreational physical activities, and movement levels in MET min/week. We evaluated metabolic syndrome components using standard criteria and examined between-group differences using two-way analysis of variance and Bonferroni  Individuals with hypertension had significantly shorter weekday sleep ( This study concludes that hypertension and obesity may reinforce each other through reduced sleep duration, lower physical activity levels, and increased energy intake, thereby exacerbating metabolic syndrome. To prevent metabolic syndrome in working adults, multiple aspects of sleep, nutrition, and physical activity that match their unique risk profiles must be considered.",

RPL is a common medical condition among reproductive-age women, with approximately 23 million cases reported annually worldwide. Up to 5% of pregnant women may experience two or more consecutive pregnancy losses. Previous studies have investigated risk factors for RPL, including maternal age, uterine pathology, genetic anomalies, infectious agents, endocrine disorders, thrombophilia, and immune dysfunction. However, RPL is a disease caused by a complex interaction of genetic factors, environmental factors (e.g., diet, lifestyle, and stress), epigenetic factors, and the immune system. In addition, due to the lack of research on genetics research related to RPL, the etiology remains unclear in up to 50% of cases. Platelets play a critical role in pregnancy maintenance.

    "abstract": "It has been hypothesized that vitamin C may have antidepressant effect through its antioxidant property. However, evidence is still scarce to ascertain the effect of dietary vitamin C on depressive symptoms. We conducted 5.9 years (median) follow-up on 91,113 Koreans who responded to Food Frequency Questionnaire and Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) scale as items of health check-up. They were categorized into four quartile groups based on dietary vitamin C intake and two groups based on the use of vitamin supplements. Incident depressive symptoms were determined by the identification of CES-D ≥16 for follow-up. Cox proportional hazards model was used to calculate the multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for depressive symptoms (multivariable-adjusted HR [95% CI]) according to quartiles of dietary vitamin C intake. Subgroup analysis was conducted by sex and physical activity. In the analysis of all participants, there was no significant association between dietary vitamin C intake quartile groups and the risk of depressive symptoms (quartile 1: reference, quartile 2: 1.01 [0.96-1.06], quartile 3: 0.99 [0.93-1.05], and quartile 4: 1.00 [0.93-1.08]). No significant association was identically observed in both men and women. Vitamin supplementation was associated with the slight increase in the risk for depressive symptoms in all participants (1.08 [1.04-1.12]), men (1.06 [1.01-1.12]), and women (1.10 [1.04-1.16]).

    "abstract": "Cataracts are a major cause of vision impairment in older adults and pose a growing concern in aging societies. This study examined the association between dietary macronutrient intake and the odds of having cataracts among 1,619 Korean adults aged ≥ 60 years using data from the 2015-2017 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Cataracts were present in 51.8% of participants. Dietary intake was assessed via 24-hour recall and macronutrient intake was categorized by quartiles and energy ratios. After adjusting for covariates, individuals in the highest quartile of carbohydrate-to-energy intake (> 80%) had 41% higher odds of having cataracts (odds ratio [OR], 1.41; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.99-2.01), with a significant trend (p for trend = 0.022). In contrast, the highest quartile of protein intake (Q3: 12%-15% energy) was associated with significantly lower odds of having cataracts in women (OR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.40-0.88). Likewise, fat intake exceeding 18% of total energy was associated with reduced odds of having cataracts (OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.49-0.97). Saturated and monounsaturated fat intake also showed inverse associations with the odds of having cataracts. These results suggest that excessive carbohydrate intake, particularly when replacing fats and proteins, may increase the odds of having cataracts in older adults, especially among women. Dietary adjustments aimed at reducing the proportion of carbohydrates and increasing high-quality protein and fat intake may help prevent cataracts in aging populations. Further longitudinal studies are needed to clarify causal relationships and to inform nutritional guideline development.",

We conducted an epigenome-wide association study to identify differential DNA methylation patterns associated with body mass index (BMI)-defined and abdominal obesity and explore their relationships with dietary intake among Korean adults (n = 1,526). We identified 23 and 1931 DMPs associated with abdominal obesity and severe BMI-defined obesity, respectively, with four CpG sites common to both phenotypes. The most significant associations were at cg10323433 and cg10501210 in serotonin receptor 2 A (HTR2A) for abdominal obesity (Δβ = -0.023) and BMI-defined obesity (Δβ = -0.021), respectively. Most DMPs (> 75%) exhibited hypomethylation in obesity with progressive changes correlating with obesity severity. Hierarchical clustering revealed distinct dietary associations: WHR-related DMPs correlated with traditional fermented foods, whereas BMI-related DMPs showed stronger associations with fruit consumption. Sites with hypomethylation in obesity consistently demonstrated positive correlations with fat intake but negative correlations with carbohydrates. The distinct associations between methylation patterns and dietary components suggest that different foods may influence epigenetic modifications that are specific to overall adiposity or fat distribution, providing potential targets for nutritional interventions to modify obesity-related epigenetic signatures.",

    "abstract": "The prevalence of dyslipidemia has increased in recent years; however, it remains a modifiable condition through diet and gut microbiome modulation. Yet, evidence from population-based studies remains limited. This study aimed to investigate the relationships among a low-carbohydrate diet (LCD), macronutrient intake, and the gut microbiome, and to evaluate their interaction effects on dyslipidemia in a Korean population. Data were drawn from two population-based studies: the Korean Microbiome Study (KMS) and the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES). We included 2,178 participants aged 20–80 years from the KMS (2017–2019) and 12,938 participants from the KNHANES (2017–2019). The LCD score and percentage of energy intake from macronutrients were calculated using either a food frequency questionnaire or a 24-hour dietary recall. Dyslipidemia was assessed based on fasting blood tests. Gut microbiota was profiled by sequencing the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene in the KMS. Multivariate logistic regression models including interaction terms were used to evaluate the joint effects of diet and the gut microbiome on dyslipidemia. A higher LCD score was associated with lower odds of atherogenic dyslipidemia and low high–density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterolemia in both studies. Although both studies showed a positive trend for fat intake and a negative trend for carbohydrate intake in relation to hypercholesterolemia, the level of significance differed slightly. We identified 38 microbial genera associated with LCD score and macronutrient intake. Notably, fat intake showed beneficial associations with triglyceride and HDL cholesterol levels in individuals carrying  These findings provide population-based evidence for the interactive role of fat and carbohydrate intake with gut microbiota in influencing dyslipidemia among Koreans.

In this study, we examined sex differences in the association between dietary quality and elevated liver enzyme levels in Korean adults. This study included a nationwide sample of 15,997 males and 22,300 females in South Korea. Dietary assessment was performed using the Korean Healthy Eating Index (KHEI), an evidence-based dietary quality index that quantitatively reflects adherence to Korean dietary guidelines (range 0-100). Serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were measured, with individuals classified as having elevated AST or ALT levels when values were ≥40 IU/L or ≥35 IU/L, respectively. Logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the association between the KHEI and elevated AST or ALT levels stratified by sex. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were determined. Among the males, a 10-point increase in the KHEI score was inversely associated with the likelihood of having elevated AST (OR: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.85-0.96) and ALT (OR: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.92-1.00) levels, respectively. Among the females, there was no clear association between the KHEI and elevated AST (OR: 0.98; 95% CI: 0.91-1.05) or ALT (OR: 1.00; 95% CI: 0.95-1.05) levels. Further research is warranted to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of the observed sex-specific associations and guide the development of targeted dietary interventions for liver health in males and females.",

The study assessed eating window, diet composition, and obesity. The eating window was defined from the first energy intake after waking up to the last before bed. Diet composition was linked to respective national food databases. Both countries saw increased snack consumption and body mass index (BMI) over 14 years. Korean adults showed the lowest obesity rates with an 8-9 hour eating window, while U.S. adults had the lowest rates with an 8-11 hour window. Macronutrient analysis revealed Korean breakfasts were carbohydrate-rich, while dinners included higher protein and alcohol intake. Koreans have shorter eating windows and lower BMI than U.S. adults. This suggests the potential benefits of time-restricted eating but highlights the need for personalized interventions and further research on individual, cultural, and environmental factors.",

    "title": "High-Intensity Interval Training Improves Memory Deficits in Obese Mice by Enhancing Osteocalcin-Driven Astrocytic BDNF Expression and Stimulating Hippocampal Neurogenesis.",
    "abstract": "Obesity contributes to cognitive disorders, particularly memory impairment. Physical exercise is a non-pharmacological approach for enhancing weight management and promoting brain health. Especially, high-intensity interval training (HIIT) yields results comparable to or even exceeding those of traditional aerobic exercises. However, its nootropic effects and underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study aims to investigate the cognitive-enhancing effects of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) in the context of neurotoxicity induced by a high-calorie diet, with particular emphasis on the role of osteocalcin (OCN)/GPR158 signaling in adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Mice were fed a high-fat, high-sucrose diet (HFHSD) for 12 weeks. They then participated in an 8-week HIIT program, with the training intensity determined based on their pre-assessed maximal running capacity (MRC). HIIT efficiently regulated body weight and feeding behavior while improving MRC. It also ameliorated HFHSD-induced memory deficits, as demonstrated by the modified Y-maze test, by promoting adult hippocampal neurogenesis, which was primarily localized to the dorsal hippocampus. Moreover, HIIT markedly increased astrocytic OCN/GPR158 signaling and significantly elevated BDNF expression in astrocytes within the dentate gyrus. Activation of the AKT/GSK3β pathway was also detected in OCN-positive astrocytes. This study collectively suggests a HIIT-specific mechanism, indicating that astrocytic OCN/GPR158 may contribute significantly to memory improvement in HFHSD-fed mice through its proneurogenic effects. Therefore, HIIT could serve as an effective strategy for combating the cognitive decline associated with metabolic disorders.",

    "abstract": "This cross-sectional study examined the association between diet quality, measured by the Korean Healthy Eating Index (KHEI), and medical expenditures among Korean adults. We used data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2016-2021). Adults aged ≥20 years with complete data on diet, sociodemographics, and healthcare use were included. Medical costs were estimated from self-reported service use and converted to USD. KHEI scores were categorized into quartiles. Multivariable linear regression was used to assess the association between KHEI quartiles and log-transformed costs. Subgroup analyses were conducted by age (<57 vs. ≥57 years), and sensitivity analyses treated KHEI as a continuous variable. A two-part model addressed skewed, zero-inflated cost data. Compared to Q1, participants in Q4 had significantly lower inpatient (β = -0.080; 95% CI: -0.139 to -0.020) and total costs (β = -0.086; 95% CI: -0.144 to -0.027). In the younger group, Q4 was associated with lower total costs (β = -0.115; 95% CI: -0.198 to -0.031). Higher continuous KHEI scores were also linked to lower costs.

    "abstract": "Access to nutritious and well-balanced food is essential for well-being. We investigated the relationship between food insecurity (FI) and cardiovascular health (CVH). This cross-sectional analysis included a nationwide sample consisting of 12,369 Korean adults. The 18-item Household Food Security Survey Module was employed to evaluate FI, with categories ranging from none, to mild, to moderate-to-severe. CVH was assessed through the \"Life's Essential 8\" (LE8) framework established by the American Heart Association. This framework includes four health behaviors (diet quality, exercise, tobacco use, and sleep) and four biometric factors (body mass index, blood lipids, blood glucose, and blood pressure). Overall, CVH was scored on a scale from 0 to 100 and categorized into ideal (LE8 score: 80-100), intermediate (LE8 score: 50-79), and poor CVH (LE8 score: 0-49). Multivariate linear and logistic regression models were used to determine the association of FI with CVH status. Within the sample, 3.7% and 0.8% experienced mild and moderate-to-severe FI, respectively. Compared with those without FI, individuals with mild (β: -2.92; 95% CI [confidence interval]: -4.37, -1.48) or moderate-to-severe (β: -7.71; 95% CI: -11.22, -4.20) FI had lower LE8 scores. Additionally, those with mild or moderate-to-severe FI were more likely to have poor CVH status (OR [odds ratio]: 2.14; 95% CI: 1.33, 3.66 for mild FI and OR: 4.83; 95% CI: 1.64, 14.17 for moderate-to-severe FI). FI is negatively associated with CVH in Korean adults. These findings underscore the need for comprehensive policy interventions to enhance food access and promote CVH in this at-risk population.",

    "abstract": "Hyperuricemia is increasingly recognized not only due to its globally increasing prevalence trend but also its correlation with several metabolic disorders. Despite dietary and nutritional factors as contributors to hyperuricemia, the role of meal timing, particularly breakfast consumption, remains understudied. We aimed to investigate the association between breakfast skipping and hyperuricemia in Korean adults. This study included 36,274 Korean adults aged ≥ 19 years from nationally representative data. Participants were classified based on self-reported weekly breakfast consumption frequency into two groups: non-breakfast skippers (≥ 5 days/week) and breakfast skippers (< 5 days/week). Hyperuricemia was defined as serum uric acid levels > 7.0 mg/dL in men and > 6.0 mg/dL in women. Multivariate logistic regression models and Poisson regression analyses were employed to evaluate the association between breakfast skipping and hyperuricemia after adjusting for demographic, lifestyle, and clinical variables. Breakfast skippers demonstrated a significantly higher risk of hyperuricemia compared to non-breakfast skippers (adjusted odds ratio: 1.220; 95% confidence interval: 1.118-1.319; p < .001). A dose-response relationship was observed between breakfast frequency and hyperuricemia risk, with prevalence decreasing progressively with increasing breakfast consumption (from 17.5% in non-consumers to 10.5% in frequent consumers). Poisson regression analyses confirmed a significant inverse association between breakfast frequency and serum uric acid levels (estimate: -0.0088; 95% confidence interval: -0.0133--0.0047; p = .0002). This study identified an association between breakfast skipping and a higher prevalence of hyperuricemia. Thus, regular breakfast intake (≥ 3-4 times/week) showed an inverse association with hyperuricemia in this study, suggesting further longitudinal studies to clarify this correlation.",

    "abstract": "The global incidence of atopic dermatitis (AD) has risen significantly in recent decades, with trends showing spatial and temporal coupling with dramatic changes in dietary habits during industrialisation. Although the Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII), a tool to quantify the inflammatory potential of diet, has made breakthroughs in the study of chronic inflammatory diseases, large-scale cross-sectional evidence for its association with AD is still lacking. Based on large-scale population-based cross-sectional data from Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey(KNHANES)2017-2023, the association between DII quartiles and AD risk was analysed using weighted multivariate logistic regression, with adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% CIs calculated, stratified by sex (male/female) and age (≤54 vs >54); interactions were assessed by the Wald test, and the association between dietary index and risk was assessed using the Restricted cubic spline(RCS) models (with nodes set at the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles of DII) were used to explore non-linear associations, with models adjusted for covariates such as sex, age, and education. Higher DII scores showed a significant association with AD prevalence. Participants in the highest DII quartile had a 73% higher risk than those in the lowest quartile (aOR = 1.73, 95% CI = 1.45-2.07).and the sex interaction was significant (interaction p<0.05), with stronger associations in the female group; RCS analyses showed a possible linear association between DII and AD risk (non-linear p>0.05). High dietary inflammatory index was significantly and positively associated with high prevalence of AD, especially in female and younger age groups; Notably, higher intake of dietary fiber and carotene is associated with a lower prevalence of AD.",

To conduct this study, the daily plant protein intake of 4254 older adults aged 65 years and older who participated in the dietary survey (24-h recall method) of the 2016~2018 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) was divided into quintiles. And the association among plant protein quintiles and general characteristics, health-related behaviors, dietary habits, nutrient intakes, and Korean Healthy Eating Index (KHEI) was examined. For the energy contribution of protein, more than 90% of all groups from Q1 through Q5 were in the Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range (AMDR, 7-20%) for protein. In the case of food security, the proportion tended to increase by about 11 percentage points from Q1 (43.4%) to Q5 (54.4%) according to plant protein quintiles, and while food insecurity was above 50% from Q1 to Q3, the percentage tended to decrease as the plant protein quintile increased from Q4 (48.3%) to Q5 (45.3%). Overall, the low plant protein intake group, especially the Q1 to Q3 group, was found to have an inadequate intake of nutrients, including total protein, compared to the recommended intake. In addition, among the components of the KHEI score, the score for the item \"consumption of multigrain rice\" was found to be very low. Based on these findings, dietary education or guidelines are needed to increase individual awareness, as well as the development of dietary content at government level to support this.",

    "abstract": "The global increase in obesity highlights the need for accurate tools to assess body composition and monitor treatment efficacy. Traditional metrics, including body mass index and waist circumference, offer limited precision for fat quantification. Imaging-based techniques capable of visualizing internal structures are increasingly being recognized for their ability to provide comprehensive fat assessment. This review outlines the principles, strengths, and limitations of key modalities, including dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), CT, MRI, and bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). DXA is cost-effective and accessible for population-level screening, whereas CT and MRI offer higher precision, particularly for visceral fat assessment. BIA is a practical, low-cost alternative, but it is limited by variability and lack of standardization. Regulatory agencies, including the US Food and Drug Administration and the Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety, are increasingly supporting imaging-based endpoints in clinical trials of anti-obesity drugs because these methods capture fat mass reduction beyond total weight loss. Recent phase III trials of semaglutide and tirzepatide have underscored the utility of DXA and CT in quantifying fat loss and preserving lean mass. Selecting appropriate imaging modalities based on technical capabilities and regulatory considerations can improve the evaluation of obesity treatments and strengthen the design of anti-obesity drug trials.",

    "abstract": "The worldwide obesity prevalence is increasing, affecting around 4 million individuals annually. This research critically evaluated the anti-obesity efficacy of the Korean mudflat halophyte herb Suaeda japonica (Suaeda japonica Makino). In the obese mice model, the administration of 200 mg/kg b.w. of S. japonica extract (SJE) significantly mitigated obesity by modulating body and organ weight, food efficiency ratio, energy expenditure, multiple blood chemistry parameters, lipid accumulation, adipose tissue hypertrophy, and various gene expressions associated with lipogenesis and thermogenesis. The significant obesity control (80%) of the aforementioned concentration of SJE treatment in mice mimics the plant-derived commercial anti-obesity drug Garcinia cambogia (Garcinia gummi-gutta) (80%, 245 mg/kg) b.w. Since SJE has not been extensively studied for obesity management, this study demonstrated that it might influence physiological, biochemical, and molecular pathways to combat obesity and related metabolic illnesses.",

    "abstract": "Despite the widespread use of ephedra in various forms, including food supplements and herbal prescriptions, comprehensive studies reviewing its efficacy and safety across different countries are lacking. We systematically searched 5 electronic databases and conducted a meta-analysis of 16 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on ephedra-containing oral medications (EOMs), performing a dose-response analysis for weight loss. The meta-analysis results revealed a statistically significant reduction in the body mass index (BMI) (MD: 1.5 kg/m2; 95% CI: -2.46 to -0.54) and secondary outcomes like body weight (BW) and waist circumference (WC). The dose-response analysis indicated a correlation between ephedra and weight reduction. The safety analysis showed no significant difference in adverse effects between the treatment and control groups (RR = 0.99, 95% CI = 0.80 ∼ 1.21, and p = 0.90). In conclusion, EOMs demonstrated effectiveness in promoting weight loss, and the dose-response analysis indicated a correlation between ephedra and weight reduction. However, additional research is necessary due to the limited number of studies and inconsistent results among the assessment criteria. Moreover, if prescribed by traditional medicine physicians within the permissible daily ephedrine dosage range of 150 mg set by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and monitored by healthcare professionals, the risk of severe adverse events is likely to be minimal. https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=387895, identifier CRD42023387895.",

    "title": "Is Chronic Ice Water Ingestion a Risk Factor for Gastric Cancer Development? An Evidence-Based Hypothesis Focusing on East Asian Populations.",
    "abstract": "This article introduces a novel risk factor for gastric cancer (GC) by analyzing available epidemiological data from East Asian populations. A significantly higher age-standardized GC rate was observed in Japanese and Korean populations than in Chinese populations, despite nearly identical ethnicity, food habits, obesity rates, and alcohol consumption. Given the pivotal role of environmental factors in GC development, particularly for the intestinal type, a thorough evaluation of the lifestyles of these three populations was conducted to identify commonalities and disparities. It was observed that Japanese and Korean individuals prefer consuming ice water, while Chinese individuals tend to drink warm water, potentially influenced by traditional Chinese medicine disciplines. Considering the key features of GC development, a literature review was conducted to investigate the mechanisms through which the consumption of ice water might contribute to GC initiation and progression. Mechanistically, exposing gastric cells to hypothermia can increase the risk of carcinogenesis through multiple pathways. This includes the promotion of Helicobacter pylori colonization, prolonged gastric inflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction in gastric cells. Furthermore, drinking ice water can enhance the survival, proliferation, and invasion of GC cells by releasing cold shock proteins, increasing gastric acid secretion, and delaying gastric emptying. Additionally, hypothermia can boost the immune evasion of cancer cells by weakening the antitumor immune system and activating different components of the tumor microenvironment. This paper also explores the association between exposure of GC cells to hypothermia and current insights into cancer hallmarks. These findings may partially elucidate the higher incidence of GC in Japanese and Korean populations and provide a clue for future experimental studies.Graphical abstract available for this article.",

It also compared the direct financial costs between the two intervention groups. In this controlled randomized educational study, 90 overweight or obese adults from four family physician clinics in Shiraz, Iran were randomly allocated to three training groups: SMS-based education, group-based education, and a control group. The participants' weight, body mass index (BMI), and waist circumference were measured at baseline, and the Physical Activity Scale questionnaire was completed. Group-based training was conducted in 1-hour weekly sessions. The SMS group received a text message each morning. The control group received routine care from a family physician. The intervention lasted 12 weeks. All participants were re-examined for the studied variables. Additionally, the direct costs were estimated, calculated, and compared. The mean weight, BMI, and waist circumference changed significantly after 3 months compared to baseline in each group. The mean weight change differed significantly among the three groups (P-value=0.04), and the mean BMI changes were near significant (P-value=0.06). A post hoc comparison of changes in weight and BMI showed a significant difference between the control and SMS groups. SMS education incurred much lower costs for patients and healthcare services than group-based education. The study showed that SMS is an effective and cost-saving educational method for weight loss compared to group-based education, especially in developing countries.",

This study was conducted to examine the associations of feeding characteristics with dietary patterns and obesity in children. This study utilized data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey conducted between 2013 and 2017. In total, 802 toddlers were included, with information on their demographic characteristics, feeding practices and duration, and 24-hour recall obtained from their parents. Feeding characteristics were categorized into feeding type, duration of total breastfeeding, duration of total formula feeding, duration of exclusive breastfeeding, and age when starting formula feeding. Dietary patterns were identified based on factor loadings for the food groups for 3 major factors, with \"vegetables & traditional,\" \"fish & carbohydrates,\" and \"sweet & fat\" patterns. Overweight/obesity was defined as ≥85th percentile in body mass index based on the 2017 Korean National Growth charts for children and adolescents. Multiple regression analysis was conducted to examine associations between feeding characteristics and dietary patterns. The association between dietary patterns and obesity was analyzed using multivariable logistic regression analysis. The early introduction of formula feeding was inversely associated with the \"vegetables & traditional\" pattern (β=-0.18; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.34 to -0.02). A higher \"vegetables & traditional\" intake was associated with a lower risk of obesity (odds ratio, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.24 to 0.95). Feeding characteristics are associated with dietary patterns in later childhood, and dietary patterns were shown to have a potential protective association against obesity.",

We aimed to compare the effects of a low-glycemic diet representing the Korean traditional balanced diet (Low-GID) and westernized diet as a control diet (CD) on anthropometry, serum metabolites, and fecal bacteria in a randomized clinical trial according to enterotypes. We recruited 52 obese women aged 30-50 years, and they consumed Low-GID and CD meals for 1 month, with a 1-month washout period, in a crossover randomized clinical trial. The Low-GID was mainly composed of whole grains with fish, vegetables, seaweeds, and perilla oil, whereas CD contained refined rice, bread, noodles, meats, and processed foods. Serum lipid profiles, metabolomics, serum short-chain fatty acids, and fecal bacteria were analyzed.

Conventional treatments for metabolic syndrome have limitations due to their nonselectivity, drug resistance, and low bioavailability. The brown seaweed Laminaria japonica (LJP) is a traditional medicine and food in Asia that has shown pharmacological and biochemical properties favorable to the prevention and treatment of lifestyle-related diseases. We will systematically review randomized controlled trials and in vivo preclinical studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of LJP as a useful treatment for metabolic syndrome. The following databases will be searched from inception to September 2021: MEDLINE (via PubMed), EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science. Randomized controlled trials and in vivo preclinical studies that analyzed LJP for the prevention and treatment of metabolic syndromes will be included. The outcome measures will include body composition, dietary habit scores, serum lipid profiles, daily nutrient intake, quality of life, number of microbiomes, gastrointestinal symptoms, and bowel function. Studies comparing LJP with any type of control intervention will be included. Data extraction using Review Manager version 5.3 and risk of bias assessment using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias will be performed by 2 independent assessors. This systematic review will provide evidence confirming the efficacy and safety of LJP in the treatment of metabolic syndrome.

    "abstract": "Sargassum serratifolium (C. Agardh) C.Agardh, a marine brown alga, has been consumed as a food and traditional medicine in Asia. A previous study showed that the meroterpenoid-rich fraction of an ethanolic extract of S. serratifolium (MES) induced adipose tissue browning and suppressed diet-induced obesity and metabolic syndrome when orally supplemented. Sargahydroquinoic acid (SHQA) is a major component of MES. However, it is unclear whether SHQA regulates energy homeostasis through the central nervous system. To examine this, SHQA was administrated through the third ventricle in the hypothalamus in high-fat diet-fed C57BL/6 mice and investigated its effects on energy homeostasis. Chronic administration of SHQA into the brain reduced body weight without a change in food intake and improved metabolic syndrome-related phenotypes. Cold experiments and biochemical analyses indicated that SHQA elevated thermogenic signaling pathways, as evidenced by an increase in body temperature and UCP1 signaling in white and brown adipose tissues. Peripheral denervation experiments using 6-OHDA indicated that the SHQA-induced anti-obesity effect is mediated by the activation of the sympathetic nervous system, possibly by regulating genes associated with sympathetic outflow and GABA signaling pathways. In conclusion, hypothalamic injection of SHQA elevates peripheral thermogenic signaling and ameliorates diet-induced obesity.",

    "abstract": "Diet plays a crucial role as a modifiable risk factor related to the development of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and its cluster. Constitution type of traditional Korean medicine has shown accuracy to predict the risk for MetS. We attempted to examine the association between nutritional status, pre-MetS, and its cluster in Korean adults by their constitution type.Participants aged 30 to 55 years who had no cancer or cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) were assigned to join in the present study. Pre-MetS was defined as ≥2 of the following factors: abdominal obesity; elevated triglycerides (TG); reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C); elevated blood pressure (BP); and elevated fasting plasma glucose (FPG). Constitution type was categorized into Tae-Eumin (TE) or non-TE. Dietary assessment of the subjects were surveyed using a short-form of the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and the nutrition quotient (NQ), which uses 4 factors, namely, balance, diversity, moderation, and dietary behavior.A total of 986 subjects were evaluated by constitution type with MetS status. Of these subjects, 48.6% had pre-MetS, 89.5% were obese and had the highest waist circumference (WC) in Pre-MetS TE. BP, FPG, TG were higher, while HDL-C was lower, than normal TE or non-TE both in Pre-MetS TE and non-TE. The prevalence of pre-MetS was positively associated with lower status of dietary behavior (odds ratio [ORs]: 2.153, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.179-3.931) while negatively related to higher vegetables and fruits intakes (ORs: 0.594, 95% CI: 0.359-0.983) in TE. Lower status of NQ had about 2 times higher risk of Pre-MetS (ORs: 1.855, 95% CI: 1.018-3.380) and abdominal obesity (ORs: 2.035, 95% CI: 1.097-3.775) in TE compared with higher status of NQ after controlling for covariates.Poor diet was a key contributor to the development of Pre-MetS and abdominal obesity in Korean adults with TE. Customized nutrition care and integrated medicinal approaches are strongly suggested to conduct optimal preventive care for people who are vulnerable to health risk.",

    "abstract": "The management of post-stroke complications plays an important role in the quality of life. Di-Tan Decoction (DTD; ) is a widely used traditional Chinese medicine. This study incorporated systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy of DTD in post-stroke neurological disorders. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) were searched from English, Chinese and Korean electronic medical databases, by including the keywords \"Di-Tan Tang\", \"Di-Tan Decoction\", \"Scour Phlegm Decoction\", \"stroke\", and \"RCT. Each RCT included control (placebo, conventional therapy, or Western medicine) and experimental (DTD treatment) groups. For patients inflicted with stroke for 1-6 weeks, the outcomes of post-stroke neurological disorders were measured by scales for post-stroke symptoms and were classified as \"completely healed\", \"markedly effective\", \"effective\" and \"ineffective\". Totally, 11 RCTs (n = 490 controls and n = 502 DTD subjects) were selected from 210 articles identified in the initial search. A meta-analysis of evaluation criteria in post-stroke symptoms revealed that the overall odds ratio (ORs) for alleviating post-stroke neurological disorders were 0.30-fold lower (95% CI = 0.21-0.43) in the DTD group than the control (Western medicine) group (P < 0.000 01). Moreover, regardless of the type of stroke diagnostic scale applied (including NFA, HDS, and NIHSS), the overall post-stroke symptoms determined were less severe in the DTD group (n = 219) than the control group (n = 217). No adverse effects of DTD were observed in the 11 RCTs reviewed. All 11 studies used an appropriate method for randomization of subjects to evaluate the risk of bias (ROB), and 7 studies included allocation concealment as well as blinding of patients and practitioners. High-risk ROB was included in 6 RCTs. No significant publication bias was derived from the funnel plot. Our results indicate that the administration of DTD alone, and DTD in combination with Western medicine, exert greater efficacy for post-stroke complication therapy, than Western medicine administered alone. More rigorous and regulated studies are required to confirm the therapeutic efficacy of DTD for post-stroke neurological disorders. disorders.",

We determined that chungkookjang made with Sunchang Research Center for Fermentation Microbes 100730 and 100731 strains of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens(SRCM100730; CKJ730) and SRCM100731(CKJ731) protected against ischemic stroke and post-stroke hyperglycemia in Mongolian gerbils with ischemic stroke induced by transient occlusion of the carotid arteries. Gerbil fed 4.5% cooked soybeans (CSB), CKJ730, CKJ731, or cellulose (negative-control) in 40 energy% fat diets for 3 weeks, and then had artery occlusion for 8 min and continued taking the assigned diet for 5 weeks. CKJ730 and CKJ731 had thrombolytic activity and prevented neuronal cell death. Consequently, they improved short-term memory and spontaneous alteration compared to the negative-control. CKJ730 and CKJ731 improved neurological symptoms including drooped eyes, crouched posture, flexor reflex, and walking patterns the most among the stroke-induced gerbils. CKJ730 and CKJ731 increased active time, grip strength, and blood flow measured by Doppler compared to the negative-control. CKJ730 protected against post-stroke glucose dysregulation by restoring β-cell mass in the gerbils with transient artery occlusion. Serum tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β levels were lower in CKJ730 and CKJ731 than the negative-control. CSB also improved glucose metabolism and suppressed inflammatory cytokines, but less than CKJ730 and CKJ731. Clostridia increased, and Bacteriodia slightly decreased in the negative-control group, compared to the normal-control. CKJ730 and CKJ731 changed the amounts of Bacteriodia and Clostridia to be similar to normal-control. In conclusion, the daily intake of chungkookjang fermented with B. amyloliquefaciens improved the gut microbiome, increased blood flow to the brain, suppressed systemic inflammation, and may reduce the susceptibility to injury from ischemic stroke in gerbils subjected to ischemic injury.",

    "abstract": "A brief episode of transient ischemia (TI) can confer cerebral ischemic tolerance against a subsequent severer TI under standard condition. The brain under obesity's conditions is more sensitive to ischemic injury. However, the impact of a brief episode of TI under obesity's conditions has not been fully addressed yet. Thus, the objective of this study was to determine the effect of a brief TI in the hippocampus of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese gerbils and related mechanisms. Gerbils were maintained on HFD or normal diet (ND) for 12 weeks and subjected to 2 min TI. HFD gerbils were heavier, with higher blood glucose, serum total cholesterol, triglycerides, and leptin levels. Massive loss of pyramidal neurons occurred in the hippocampal cornu ammonis 1 (CA1) field of HFD animals at 5 days after 2 min of TI, but 2 min of TI did not elicit death of pyramidal neurons in ND gerbils. The HFD group showed significantly increased levels of oxidative stress indicators (dihydroethidium and 4-hydroxynonenal) and proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β) and microglial activation in pre- and/or post-ischemic phases compared to the ND group. Levels of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and phosphorylated-mTOR in the CA1 field of the HFD group were also significantly higher than the ND group. On the other hand, inhibition of mTOR activation by rapamycin (an allosteric mTOR inhibitor) significantly attenuated neuronal death induced by HFD, showing reduction of HFD-induced increases of oxidative stress indicators and proinflammatory cytokines, and microglia activation. Taken together, a brief episode of TI can evoke neuronal death under obesity's conditions. It might be closely associated with an abnormal increase of mTOR activation-mediated, severe oxidative stress and neuroinflammation in pre- and/or post-ischemic phases.",

    "abstract": "Yangkyuksanwha-tang (YST) is an herbal medicine based on Sasang constitutional medicine (SCM) and is widely used in Korean traditional medicine. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of YST on obesity in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice. We induced obesity in C57bl/6 J mice using a HFD, and then orally administered 300 mg/kg YST for 6 weeks. We measured body weight, food efficiency, organ and fat weight, serum biochemical parameters, and obesity-related gene expression, and carried out histological analysis at the end of the experimental period. YST significantly reduced the absolute body weight and food efficiency ratio. The serum, aminotransferase, glucose, total cholesterol, triglyceride, and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels were significantly lower in the YST-treated group than in the control group, whereas the high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol level in the YST-treated group was significantly higher. The YST-treated group also showed a significant reduction in regional fatty tissues and the absolute weight of various organs. We also observed a significantly reduced expression of AP2/FABP4, C/EBP-β, leptin, and SREBP1c/ADD1 mRNA, and significantly increased expression of UCP-2 and adiponectin mRNA in adipose tissue in the YST-treated group. YST also decreased the lipid droplet size and lipid accumulation in the liver, as well as adipocyte size in epididymal adipose tissue. At the dose tested, YST was non-toxic to the liver and kidneys of the mice. The results imply that YST has anti-obesity effects in obesity-induced mice. Although the number of experimental animals was limited and the drug effects concern mice, rather than humans, which have different constitutions, the study has valuable implications with respect to the general effects of YST.",

Ojayeonjonghwan, OJa, is a traditional Oriental medicine that is used for both male and female reproductive health and has a long history of safe use. We evaluated the effectiveness of two variations of OJa (OJa1 and OJa2) for treating menopausal symptoms in ovariectomized (OVX) rats. Both OJa preparations were effective for relieving indicators of hot flashes and depression, and for preventing loss of bone mineral density and lean body mass. Only OJa 2 prevented memory dysfunction. These results show that the traditional Oriental medicine, Ojayeonjonghwan, has the potential to relieve menopausal symptoms in women and should be further evaluated in human clinical trials as an alternative to convention therapies in women for whom conventional therapies are not indicated or found to be ineffective.",

    "abstract": "Cornus kousa the Korean dogwood has been traditionally used in East Asia as therapeutic traditional medicine however biological activities of Cornus kousa have not been investigated previously. The aim of the present study was to evaluate anti-obesity activities coupled with anti-angiogenic activities of anthocyanins rich fraction of ethanolic leaf extract of Cornus kousa (ELECk) in HUVECs and 3T3- L1 cells. Dried plants leaves were extracted with 70% ethanol and anthocyanin fraction (AnT Fr) was obtained by eluting the ethanolic extract through non-polar macroporous resin and further purification by HPLC. Antiangiogenic activities were determined by antiproliferative effect of AnT Fr on HUVECs. In the presence of various concentrations of AnT Fr, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were induced to differentiate. Lipid accumulation in differentiated adipocytes were quantified by Oil-Red O staining. AnT Fr significantly suppressed angiogenesis by inhibiting proliferation and tube formation of HUVECs via downregulating VEGRF 2, PI3K, β-catenin, NF-kB, and Akt1 in a dose dependent manner. AnT Fr inhibited lipid accumulation by down-regulating adipogenesis and lipogenesis promoting signaling proteins, PPARγ, CCAAT, C/EBPα, aP2, FAS, and LPL, however enhanced AMPK activation to p-AMPK in 3T3 cells quantified and expressed by western blotting. AnT Fr inhibit lipid accumulation by regulating adipogenesis and lipogenesis related genes and signaling proteins. The anti-obesity activities exerted by Cornus kousa are associated with antiangiogenic activities of anthocyanins rich fraction of Cornus kousa. Hence the presence of bioactive anthocyanins, Cornus kosa, is a good candidate for nutraceutical and pharmaceutical formulation for treating or controlling obesity.",

    "abstract": "Blue honeysuckle (BH, Lonicera caerulea) is used as a traditional medicine in Russia, Japan and China, but is not commonly considered as an edible berry in Europe, USA or Korea. BH has been revealed to decrease serum cholesterol and triacylglycerol (triglyceride or TG) levels through the activation of AMP‑activated protein kinase (AMPK), thus it is expected to be a health functional food and pharmaceutical agent for the prevention of non‑alcoholic liver damage, in addition to effects as a suppressor of hyperlipidemia and as an anti‑obesity agent. In the present study, the pharmacological activity of BH extract (BHe) was observed in high‑fat diet (HFD)‑fed mice. Significant increases in fat pad weight, body weight, fat accumulation (body and abdominal fat density, and thickness of the periovarian and abdominal wall) and serum biochemical levels (aspartate transaminase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase, γ‑glutamyltransferase, total cholesterol, low‑density lipoprotein and TG, with the exception of high‑density lipoprotein) were observed in HFD‑fed mice. In addition, increases in adipocyte hypertrophy, the area of steatohepatitis and hepatocyte hypertrophy were observed, whereas decreased zymogen content was identified upon histopathological observation. Increased deterioration of the endogenous antioxidant defense system (liver catalase, glutathione and superoxide dismutase) and hepatic lipid peroxidation was observed. In addition, there were decreases in hepatic glucokinase activity, AMPKα1 and AMPKα2 mRNA expression, adipose tissue uncoupling protein 2 expression, and adiponectin mRNA expression, increases in phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glucose‑6‑phosphatase activity, hepatic acetyl‑CoA carboxylase 1 mRNA expression, and the expression of leptin, CCAAT/enhancer‑binding protein (C/EBP) α, C/EBPβ and sterol‑regulatory‑element‑binding protein 1c mRNA in the periovarian tissue. Furthermore, non‑alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and obesity were significantly inhibited by the continuous administration of BHe for 84 days. These results revealed that BHe may be a promising novel drug or functional food candidate for the treatment of obesity and NAFLD.",

    "abstract": "Recently, Korean traditional fermented soybean paste, called Doenjang, has attracted attention for its protective effect against diet-related chronic diseases such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Long-term fermented soybean pastes (LFSPs) are made by fermentation with naturally-occurring microorganisms for several months, whereas short-term fermented soybean pastes (SFSPs) are produced by shorter-time fermentation inoculated with a starter culture. Here, we demonstrate that administration of LFSP, but not SFSP, protects high-fat diet (HFD)-fed obese mice against non-alcohol fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and insulin resistance. LFSP suppressed body weight gain in parallel with reduction in fat accumulation in mesenteric adipose tissue (MAT) and the liver via modulation of MAT lipolysis and hepatic lipid uptake. LFSP-treated mice also had improved glucose tolerance and increased adiponectin levels concomitantly with enhanced AMPK activation in skeletal muscle and suppressed expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in skeletal muscle and the liver. LFSP also attenuated HFD-induced gut permeability and lowered serum lipopolysaccharide level, providing an evidence for its probiotic effects, which was supported by the observation that treatment of a probiotic mixture of LFSP-originated Bacillus strains protected mice against HFD-induced adiposity and glucose intolerance. Our findings suggest that the intake of LFSP, but not SFSP, offers protection against NAFLD and insulin resistance, which is an effect of long-term fermentation resulting in elevated contents of active ingredients (especially flavonoids) and higher diversity and richness of Bacillus probiotic strains compared to SFSP.",

    "abstract": "The leaves of Aster yomena (Kitam.) Honda have long been used as a traditional herb for treating disorders including coughs, asthma, and insect bites. According to recent studies, A. yomena leaf extracts have several pharmacological properties, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-asthmatic activities. However, little information is available regarding their anti-obesity effect. In this study, we investigated the inhibitory effect of the ethanol extracts of A. yomena leaves (EEAY) on adipocyte differentiation and adipogenesis using 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. When 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were treated with various concentrations of EEAY (ranging from non-toxic), the number of lipid droplets, lipid content, and triglyceride production, the typical characteristics of adipocytes, were suppressed in a concentration-dependent manner. During this process, EEAY significantly reduced the expression of adipogenic transcription factors, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α and β, and sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c. In addition, EEAY was also found to potently inhibit the expression of adipocyte-specific genes, including adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein and leptin. In particular, EEAY treatment effectively enhanced the activation of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway; however, the co-treatment with compound C, an inhibitor of AMPK, significantly restored the EEAY-induced inhibition of pro-adipogenic transcription factors and adipocyte-specific genes. These results indicate that EEAY may exert an anti-obesity effect by controlling the AMPK signaling pathway, suggesting that the leaf extract of A. yomena may be a potential anti-obesity agent.",

    "abstract": "Traditional medicines have been leveraged for the treatment and prevention of obesity, one of the fastest growing diseases in the world. However, the exact mechanisms underlying the effects of traditional medicine on obesity are not yet fully understood. We produced the transcriptomes of epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT), liver, muscle, and hypothalamus harvested from mice fed a normal diet, high-fat-diet alone, high-fat-diet together with green tea, or a high-fat-diet together with Taeumjowitang, a traditional Korean medicine. We found tissue-specific gene expression patterns as follows: (i) the eWAT transcriptome was more significantly altered by Taeumjowitang than by green tea, (ii) the liver transcriptome was similarly altered by Taeumjowitang and green tea, and (iii) both the muscle and hypothalamus transcriptomes were more significantly altered by green tea than Taeumjowitang. We then applied integrated network analyses, which revealed that functional networks associated with lymphocyte activation were more effectively regulated by Taeumjowitang than by green tea in the eWAT. In contrast, green tea was a more effective regulator of functional networks associated with glucose metabolic processes in the eWAT. Taeumjowitang and green tea have a differential tissue-specific and pathway-specific therapeutic effect on obesity.",

    "title": "Korean red ginseng (Panax ginseng) inhibits obesity and improves lipid metabolism in high fat diet-fed castrated mice.",
    "abstract": "Korean red ginseng (Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer, Araliaceae) has been historically used as a traditional drug for the prevention and treatment of most ageing-related diseases, such as obesity, dyslipidemia, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Elderly men with testosterone deficiency are strongly associated with many of the aforementioned metabolic diseases. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of ginseng on obesity and lipid metabolism in a mouse model of testosterone deficiency (castrated C57BL/6J mice). The effects of ginseng extract (GE) on obesity and lipid metabolism in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed castrated C57BL/6J mice were examined using hematoxylin and eosin staining, serum lipid analysis, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The effects of GE, ginsenosides, and testosterone on adipogenesis were measured using Oil Red O staining, XTT assay, and real-time PCR. Compared with HFD mice, mice receiving HFD supplemented with GE (HFD-GE) for 8 weeks showed decreased body weight, adipose tissue mass, and adipocyte size without affecting food intake. Serum levels of triglycerides and total cholesterol were lowered in HFD-GE mice than in HFD mice. GE also markedly reduced HFD-induced hepatic lipid accumulation. Concomitantly, HFD-GE decreased mRNA expression of adipogenesis-related genes (SREBP-1C, PPARγ, FAS, SCD1, and ACC1) in visceral adipose tissues compared with HFD alone. Consistent with the in vivo data, GE and major active ginsenosides (Rb1 and Rg1) decreased lipid accumulation and mRNA expression of PPARγ, C/EBPα, and SCD1 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes compared with control. Similarly, testosterone also decreased lipid accumulation and mRNA levels of PPARγ, C/EBPα, and SCD1. These inhibitory effects were further increased by co-treatment of GE or ginsenosides with testosterone. Our results demonstrate that ginseng can inhibit obesity and dyslipidemia in HFD-fed castrated mice, possibly by inhibiting adipogenic gene expression. In addition, our results indicate that ginseng may act like testosterone to inhibit adipogenesis, suggesting that ginseng may be able to prevent obesity, hyperlipidemia, and hepatic steatosis in men with testosterone deficiency.",

    "abstract": "Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are ubiquitous contaminants found worldwide, including in South Korea. As a result, they are frequently detected in Koreans. However, there is limited representative data and information on potential sources in Korea. Therefore, we measured the serum concentrations of ten PFASs in nationally representative samples of the Korean population (n=1874, 18-69 years) and evaluated the factors associated with their exposure. Serum PFOS, PFDA, PFOA, and PFNA were detected in nearly all participants (83.1-99.9%). However, serum PFPA, PFHxA, and PFHpA were almost undetected (<0.5% of participants). PFOS had the highest population-weighted geometric mean of 10.23ng/mL (95% CI: 9.99-10.47), which was followed by PFOA with 2.85ng/mL (95% CI: 2.73-2.97) and PFDA with 2.17ng/mL (95% CI: 2.12-2.23). PFNA, PFDA, PFHxS, PFOA, and PFOS concentrations were higher in males (p<0.001) and older adults (p<0.001). PFNA was higher in those who used wax, polish, and water-resistant materials (adjusted proportional change=1.14; 95% CI: 1.08-1.22), and those who ate cooked fish (1.16; 95% CI: 1.03-1.31) compared to those who ate nearly no fish. PFDA was higher in those who used herbicides and pesticides (1.05; 95% CI: 1.02-1.09), those who drank beverages in a plastic bag on a daily basis (1.10; 95% CI: 1.03-1.19), and those who ate raw fish (1.15; 95% CI: 1.03-1.29) or cooked fish (1.13; 95% CI: 1.05-1.23) compared to those who ate nearly no fish. PFHxS was higher in those who used traditional Korean health supplement foods (1.08; 95% CI: 1.01-1.15). PFOA was higher in those who used plastic wrap in a microwave daily or weekly (1.08; 95% CI: 1.00-1.16), and those who used disposable paper cups (1.07; 95% CI: 1.01-1.13). PFOS was lower in underweight participants (0.84; 95%CI: 0.75-0.93) compared to those who were obese, and higher in those who exercised regularly (1.08; 95% CI: 1.03-1.14) or irregularly (1.06, 95% CI: 1.01-1.12) compared to those who did not exercise. Subjects who used severely damaged Teflon appliances had lower concentrations of PFOA (0.78, 95% CI: 0.65-0.95), while regular use of Gore-Tex goods was related to higher PFNA (1.15, 95% CI: 1.03-1.28) and PFDA (1.11; 95% CI: 1.02-1.20) levels. These findings suggest that most Koreans are frequently exposed to PFASs, and that serum concentrations of PFASs vary with age, sex, and exposure factors.",

    "abstract": "The cortex of Cinnamomum cassia Presl (Cinnamomi Cortex: CC) has commonly been used for weight control in traditional medicines, but without a scientific basis. Therefore, this study was undertaken to investigate the anti-obesity effect of CC extract in a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mouse model and in C2C12 mouse skeletal muscle cells. Male C57BL/6 mice were fed a normal diet or a HFD for 16 consecutive weeks, and orally administered CC extract (100 or 300[Formula: see text]mg/kg) or metformin (250[Formula: see text]mg/kg; positive control) daily for 16 weeks. CC extract administration significantly decreased body weights, food intakes, and serum levels of glucose, insulin, total cholesterol and ALT levels, prevented oral glucose tolerance and insulin resistance, inhibited the protein expressions of MyHC and PGC1[Formula: see text] and the phosphorylation of AMPK, suppressed lipid accumulation in liver, decreased adipocyte size and increased muscle mass in obese mice. For this in vitro study, C2C12 myoblasts were differentiated into the myotubes for five days, and then treated with CC extract (0.1 or 0.2[Formula: see text]mg/ml) for 24[Formula: see text]h. CC extract significantly increased ATP levels by increasing the mRNA expressions of mitochondrial biogenesis-related factors, such as, PGC1[Formula: see text], NRF-1, and Tfam, and the phosphorylations of AMPK and ACC. Our results suggest CC extract controls weight gain in obese mice by inhibiting lipid accumulation and increasing energy expenditure, and that its action mechanism involves the up-regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis in skeletal muscle cells.",

    "abstract": "GuiZhi-ShaoYao-ZhiMu decoction (GSZD), a traditional Chinese herbal medication for the management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), has a long history of use and modern scientific research support for efficacy, but the studies have not been systematically evaluated. Therefore, this study systematically reviewed the efficacy of GSZD using the available human clinical trials and conducted a meta-analysis. The available databases were searched using proper languages of English, Korean, and Chinese. The key erms used for searching were \"GSZD,\" \"Cassia Twig,\" \"Guizhi,\" \"Paeonia lactiflora,\" \"Shaoyao,\" \"Anemarrhena Rhizome,\" \"Zhimu,\" \"rheumatoid arthritis,\" \"randomized,\" \"controlled trial,\" and \"clinical trial.\" Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) using GSZD were included in the review and meta-analysis. According to heterogeneity, odds ratio and confidence intervals in the pooled RCTs were assessed by a fixed or random model in meta-analysis. Risk of bias was evaluated for all included studies. Thirteen RCTs met the inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. All studies evaluated the efficacy of GSZD for treating RA, but the herbal formulations varied since some studies added herbs to the basic GSZD formulation. However, all formulations contained the essential herbs: Guizhi, Shaoyao, and Zhimu. Each RCT included an experimental group (GSZD with or without Western-style medicine) and a control group (either standard Western-style medicines or placebo). When compared to placebo, the GSZD treatment was found to be three to six times more effective than standard Western drugs for some symptoms. Furthermore, only two studies reported any adverse events associated with the GSZD group, whereas several reported serious adverse events in the control groups. The Traditional Chinese Medicine, GSZD, may have equal or superior effectiveness and safety for treating RA compared to Western RA drugs. It should be considered a viable alternative to Western medicine. However, more long-term research is needed in larger patient groups to better establish its safety and efficacy.",

    "abstract": "The fruit of Lycium chinense Miller (Solanaceae) is used as a functional food and a medicinal herb for treating many specific health concerns. Weight gain induced by estrogen deficiency is a problem for post-menopausal women around the globe. The present study investigates the effects of aqueous extract of L. chinense (LC) on post-menopausal obesity. Female C57BL/6 mice were ovariectomized and fed on high-fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks to induce post-menopausal obesity. LC extract (1[Formula: see text]mg/kg and 10[Formula: see text]mg/kg) was orally administrated for 6 weeks with continuous HFD feeding. Ovarian adipose tissues and uterus were weighed. Serum triglyceride, cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and fasting glucose levels were analyzed. The expressions of adipocyte-specific factors and estrogen receptors (ERs) were investigated. Additionally, lipid accumulation was confirmed in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Increased body weight due to post-menopausal obesity was ameliorated about 14.7% and 17.76% by treatment of 1[Formula: see text]mg/kg and 10[Formula: see text]mg/kg LC, respectively. LC treatment reduced both of serum lipid and fasting blood glucose levels. Adipocyte hypertrophy and fatty liver were ameliorated in LC-treated groups. In LC-treated adipocyte cells, lipid accumulation was significantly inhibited. The expression of perilipin in adipose tissues was decreased by LC. In addition, expression of PPAR-[Formula: see text] protein was down-regulated in adipose tissues and differentiated adipocytes, while GLUT4 expression was increased in adipose tissues by LC treatment. Moreover, LC treatment up-regulated the expressions of ER-[Formula: see text]/[Formula: see text] accompanied with increased uterine weight. These results showed the ameliorative effects of LC on overweight after menopause. Post-menopausal obesity may be improved by LC treatment.",

The present study was designed to investigate the effect and mechanism of CTJ tea extract on body weight gain using C57BL/6J-Lep ob/ob mice and 3T3-L1 adipocytes, respectively. The effects of CTJ on cell viability, lipid accumulation, and expression of protein and mRNA were measured in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by using 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, oil red O staining, Western blotting, and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analyses. C57BL6J-Lep ob/ob mice were administered with CTJ (200 or 400 mg/kg body weight) for ten weeks. Then, body weight, food intake, total cholesterol, and triglyceride were measured in ob/ob mice. CTJ tea extract treated at 250 μg/mL (CTJ250) significantly suppressed lipid accumulation in the differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Likewise, CTJ250 significantly decreased the protein expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptorγ (PPARγ), CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α, and adipocyte lipid-binding protein, and regulated the mRNA expression of PPARγ, sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c gene, fatty acid synthase, adipocyte lipid-binding protein, hormone-sensitive lipase, carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1, cluster of differentiation 36, and acetyl-CoA carboxylase in the differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Mice administered with CTJ showed dose-dependent decrease in body weight gain, starting from week 4 of the experiment. CTJ tea extract administered at 400 mg/kg body weight significantly decreased fat mass, food efficacy ratio, and levels of plasma triglyceride and total cholesterol. CTJ attenuated weight gain in ob/ob mice and regulated the activity of the molecules involved in adipogenesis and lipolysis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. CTJ is a potentially valuable herbal therapy for the prevention of obesity and/or obesity-related disorders.",

    "abstract": "Anthocyanin-rich black soybeans have been used in traditional East Asian medicine to cure diseases related to oxidative stress and carcinogens, but not obesity. Our objective was to investigate the effects of anthocyanin-rich black soybean testa extracts (BBT), Glycine max (Chongja No. 3), on obesity. In total, 63 participants defined as overweight or obese by their body mass index (BMI >23) or waist circumference (WC >90 cm for males, >85 cm for females) were sorted into two groups: 32 receiving the trial medication (BBT, 2.5 g/d) and 31 receiving the placebo (starch, 2.5 g/d). Participants completed an 8-week, randomized, double-blinded, and placebo-controlled clinical trial. There were no significant differences between the two groups at the beginning of the trial, and both required the same safety assessments. Significant decreases in abdominal fat, described according to WC and hip circumference, and lipid profiles such as triacylglycerols (TG), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLc), and non-high density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDLc) were observed in the BBT group at the conclusion of the clinical trial. The indicators for arteriosclerosis such as total cholesterol (TC)/HDLc and LDLc/HDLc were significantly decreased in the BBT group, but had not changed in the placebo group. With no difference between the two groups in energy-adjusted dietary intakes and physical activity, BBT was shown to strongly improve plasma lipid profiles, related to the reduction of WC (an indicator of abdominal fat) as long as high dietary fiber and low cholesterol diets were maintained. In conclusion, BBT can potentially be developed as a functional food for preventing abdominal obesity with high fiber and low cholesterol diets.",

CSE inhibited adipocyte differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and decreased expression of the adipogenic transcription factors, SREBP1c and PPARγ, and their target genes. Six-week-old obese (ob/ob) mice were fed a high-fat diet and treated with CSE (50 or 100 mg/kg/day) by oral gavage for 6 weeks. Body fat mass (epididymal and perirenal white adipose tissues) in the CSE-treated groups was significantly lower than that in the high-fat diet control (HFD) group, whereas average daily food intake was not significantly different among the groups. Plasma and hepatic triglyceride levels and plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level were also significantly lower in the CSE groups compared to the HFD group. These results suggest that CSE which decreases body fat mass and improves lipid profiles in plasma and liver, represents a potential treatment option for obesity and associated metabolic disorders, including hyperlipidemia.",

    "title": "Instant noodles, processed food intake, and dietary pattern are associated with atopic dermatitis in an adult population (KNHANES 2009-2011).",
    "abstract": "The incidence of atopic dermatitis (AD) is continuously increasing in industrialized countries, possibly due to dietary and lifestyle changes. However, the association between processed food intake and AD has not been studied in a large adult population. We investigated the association between dietary habits and AD in 17,497 adults in the 2009-2011 Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES). We identified 4 dietary patterns using principal components analysis of a 63-item food frequency questionnaire: the \"traditional dietary pattern\", rich in rice and kimchi; the \"processed food pattern\", with more meat, instant noodles, soda, and processed foods; the \"healthy dietary pattern\", high in grains, vegetables, fruits, and seaweeds; and the \"drinking dietary pattern\", mainly drinking coffee and alcohol. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for AD were calculated according to dietary patterns after adjusting for potential confounders with incorporation of sample weights for the complex sample design. The \"meat and processed food\" pattern was associated with a significant 1.57 fold higher OR for atopic dermatitis than the low consumption group. Further analysis revealed that the increased atopic dermatitis was most closely associated with instant noodles. In contrast, the groups with high intake of rice and kimchi exhibited lower ORs, 0.38 and 0.43 folds, compared to the low intake group. Consuming instant noodles, meat and processed foods was associated with increased prevalence of atopic dermatitis, whereas consuming rice and kimchi, and coffee was associated with decreased prevalence of atopic dermatitis. 背景与目的：特应性皮炎的发生率在工业化国家持续增加，可能是由于饮食 和生活方式的改变。然而，加工食品与特应性皮炎的关系还没有在大人群中研 究过。方法与研究设计：我们研究了2009-2011 年韩国全国健康和营养调查中 17,497 名成年人饮食习惯与特应性皮炎的关系。结果：我们采用主成分法分析 了含有63 个条目的食物频率问卷，确定了4 个膳食模式：“传统膳食模式”： 富含大米和泡菜；“加工食品模式”：更多的肉、方便面、饮料、加工食品； “健康膳食模式”：高谷物、蔬菜、水果和海藻；“饮用膳食模式”：主要饮用咖 啡和酒精。校正掺入复杂样本设计的样本权重等潜在混杂因素，根据膳食模式 计算校正的比值比（ORs）。“肉和加工食品”模式高摄入组比低摄入组特应性 皮炎的OR 值高1.57 倍。进一步分析显示：特应性皮炎的增加与方便面关系 最密切。相反，大米和泡菜高摄入组与低摄入组相比，OR 值较低，分别为 0.38 和0.43。结论：方便面、肉类和加工食品的摄入与特应性皮炎的患病率增 加有关，而大米、泡菜和咖啡的摄入与特应性皮炎的患病率降低有关。.",

    "abstract": "Chungkookjang is a Korean representative fermented soybean food. In this study, we investigated the effect of Korean traditional Chungkookjang compared with placebo on body composition, dyslipidemia and risk factors for atherosclerosis in overweight/obese subjects. This double-blind, randomized, controlled crossover trial was conducted on 120 overweight/obese subjects, aged 19-29 years. Subjects were randomly divided into a Chungkookjang (n=60) or a placebo (n=60) group. After 12 weeks, the groups were crossed over for an additional 12 weeks. During the intervention period, subjects were asked to maintain their usual diet and activity and not to take any functional foods or dietary supplements. The anthropometric measures, lipid profiles and atherogenic indices were determined at baseline and at the end of each 12-week period. The anthropometry measurements, percentage body fat, lean body mass, waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio of women in the Chungkookjang group were significantly improved compared with the placebo group. Lipid profiles and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein of women in Chungkookjang were significantly improved. The atherogenic indices of apolipoprotein B/apolipoprotein A1 decreased in both the placebo and the Chungkookjang group, and it also decreased below 0.55 for all the men and women in the Chungkookjang group. In conclusion, these results suggest that supplementation with Chungkookjang may improve body composition and risk factors for cardiovascular disease in overweight and obese adults.",

    "abstract": "The Korean traditional hot sauce gochujang has been reported to have biological activities. Different kinds of gochujang products were prepared based on combinations of a fungal rice koji with two kinds of bacterial soybean mejus. Diets that included gochujang products were fed to rats and anti-obesity effects were investigated. Gochujang products reduced body weight gains, epididymal fat weights, and triglyceride levels in the serum and the liver. Effects were exerted by the diet that included the non-fermented gochujang mixture, increased using a fungal rice koji, and further enhanced using a bacterial soybean meju. Dietary effects were apparently induced via inhibition of the lipogenic enzymes fatty acid synthase, malic enzyme, and lipoprotein lipase by gochujang products in epididymal adipose tissues, and inhibition of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase in the liver. High levels of capsaicin and genistein in gochujang products are considered to contribute to anti-obesity effects.",

    "title": "Meat and milk intake in the rice-based Korean diet: impact on cancer and metabolic syndrome.",
    "abstract": "Over a few decades, Korean diet has changed from traditional diet, mainly composed of rice and vegetables, to Westernised diet rich, in meat and milk, along with the economic development and globalisation. Increasing prevalence of diet-related chronic diseases such as cancer and metabolic syndrome (MetS) is becoming a heavy burden to society and requires further attention. In this review, the association of meat and milk consumption with cancer and MetS among Koreans was discussed. Previous meta-analyses showed that meat intake was positively associated with increased risk of cancers, especially colon, as well as obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus, and that the intake of milk and dairy products was negatively associated with colorectal cancer, obesity, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, based on studies conducted mostly in Western countries. In Korea and other Asian countries, the association of meat and milk intake with cancers were inconclusive and varied by types of cancers. Conversely, milk intake was negatively associated with MetS risk as reported in Western countries. The difference in results between Korea and Western countries might come from the differences in dietary patterns and study designs. Most Koreans still maintain traditional dietary pattern, although rapid change towards Westernised diet is underway among the younger age group. Randomised clinical trials or prospective cohort studies with consideration of combined effects of various dietary factors in Korea and other Asian countries are needed to elucidate the impact of meat and milk or related dietary patterns in their diet.",

    "abstract": "Schisandra chinensis (Turcz.) Baill. (SC) is a traditional Chinese herbal medicine with diverse pharmacological activities for treatment of various human diseases. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is associated with the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). In this study, we investigated the protective effects of methanol extract of Schisandra chinensis (SC extract) against ER stress-induced NAFLD in vitro and in vivo. The protective effects of SC extract were examined in tunicamycin- or palmitate-treated HepG2 cells in vitro, and in tunicamycin-injected mice or high fed diet (HFD) obese mice in vivo. Expression of ER stress markers including glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78), C/EBP homolog protein (CHOP), and X-box-binding protein-1 (XBP-1), and triglyceride accumulation were measured in HepG2 cells and in the liver of mice. SC extract significantly inhibited expression of tunicamycin-induced ER stress markers in tunicamycin-treated HepG2 cells and in the liver of tunicamycin-injected mice, and it also inhibited tunicamycin-induced triglyceride accumulation. Similar observations were made under physiological ER stress conditions such as in palmitate-treated HepG2 cells and in the liver of HFD obese mice. In addition, SC extract repressed the expression of inflammatory genes and lipogenic genes in palmitate-treated HepG2 cells. Schisandrin, an abundant bioactive lignan in SC extract, inhibited the expression of ER stress markers in tunicamycin-or palmitate-treated HepG2 cells, whereas Gomisin J did not affect ER stress markers. SC attenuates ER stress and prevents development of NAFLD. SC may be useful as a pharmacological agent for protection against ER stress-induced human diseases.",

In our previous works, Allomyrina dichotoma larvae (ADL) inhibited differentiation of adipocytes both in vitro and in vivo. However, the anorexigenic and endoplasmic reticulum(ER) stress-reducing effects of ADL in obesity has not been examined. In this study, we investigated the anorexigenic and ER stress-reducing effects of ADL in the hypothalamus of diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. Intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of ethanol extract of ADL (ADE) suggested that an antagonizing effect on ghrelin-induced feeding behavior through the mTOR and MAPK signaling pathways.

SA reduced the body weight, visceral fat mass, serum levels of leptin, TNFα, IFNγ, IL-6 and MCP-1, insulin resistance, hepatic lipid content, droplets and early fibrosis, whereas it elevated the circulation of adiponectin. SA down-regulated lipogenic genes (Cidea, Pparγ, Srebp-1c, Srebp-2, Hmgcr, Fasn) and inflammatory genes (Tlr4, Myd88, NF-κB, Tnfα, Il6), whereas it up-regulated fatty acid oxidation genes (Pparα, Acsl, Cpt1, Cpt2) in the liver. SA also decreased hepatic lipogenic enzyme activities and elevated fatty acid oxidation enzyme activities relative to the HFD group. These findings suggested that dietary SA possesses anti-obesity, anti-inflammatory and anti-steatotic effects via the regulation of lipid metabolic and inflammatory genes.

    "title": "Understanding the molecular aspects of oriental obesity pattern differentiation using DNA microarray.",
    "abstract": "Human constitution, the fundamental basis of oriental medicine, is categorized into different patterns for a particular disease according to the physical, physiological, and clinical characteristics of the individuals. Obesity, a condition of metabolic disorder, is classified according to six patterns in oriental medicine, as follows: spleen deficiency syndrome, phlegm fluid syndrome, yang deficiency syndrome (YDS), food accumulation syndrome (FAS), liver depression syndrome (LDS), and blood stasis syndrome. In oriental medicine, identification of the disease pattern for individual obese patients is performed on the basis of differentiation in obesity syndrome index and, accordingly, personalized treatment is provided to the patients. The aim of the current study was to understand the obesity patterns in oriental medicine from the genomic point of view via determining the gene expression signature of obese patients using peripheral blood mononuclear cells as the samples. The study was conducted in 23 South Korean obese subjects (19 female and four male) with BMI ≥25 kg/m(2). Identification of oriental obesity pattern was based on the software-guided evaluation of the responses of the subjects to a questionnaire developed by the Korean Institute of Oriental Medicine. The expression profiles of genes were determined using DNA microarray and the level of transcription of genes of interest was further evaluated using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Gene clustering analysis of the microarray data from the FAS, LDS, and YDS subjects exhibited disease pattern-specific upregulation of expression of several genes in a particular cluster. Further analysis of transcription of selected genes using qRT-PCR led to identification of specific genes, including prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase 2, G0/G1 switch 2, carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 3, cystein-serine-rich nuclear protein 1, and interleukin 8 receptor, alpha which were highly expressed in LDS obesity constitution. Our current study can be considered as a valuable contribution to the understanding of possible explanation for obesity pattern differentiation in oriental medicine. Further studies can address a novel possibility that the genomic and oriental empirical approaches can be combined and implemented in systematic and synergistic development of personalized medicine. This clinical trial was registered in Clinical Research Information Service of Korea National Institute of Health ( https://cris.nih.go.kr/cris/index.jsp ). KCT0000387.",

    "abstract": "Dietary patterns are a risk factor for metabolic syndrome (MetS). The prevalence of MetS has increased in Korea, and this condition has become a public health issue. Therefore, the present cross-sectional study aimed to identify the associations between dietary patterns and the risk of MetS among Korean women.The data of 5189 participants were analyzed to determine dietary intake and lifestyle. A principal components analysis was employed to determine participant dietary patterns with regard to 106 food items. MetS was diagnosed using the National Cholesterol Education Program, Adult Treatment Panel III. Logistic regression analyses were applied to evaluate the associations between dietary pattern quintiles and MetS and to generate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) after adjusting for potential confounders.Three dietary patterns were identified: \"traditional,\" \"western,\" and \"prudent.\" The \"prudent\" dietary pattern consisted of a high intake of fruits and fruit products as well as nuts, dairy, and a low consumption of grains; this pattern was negatively associated with the risk of MetS. The highest quintile of the \"prudent\" dietary pattern was significantly less likely to develop MetS (OR: 0.5, 95% CI: 0.36-0.68, P for trend <0.001) compared with the lowest quintile. This pattern was also negatively associated with all of the MetS diagnostic criteria: abdominal obesity (OR: 0.52, 95% CI: 0.41-0.65), blood pressure (OR: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.59-0.87), triglycerides (OR: 0.67, 95% CI: 0.52-0.85), fasting glucose (OR: 0.64, 95% CI: 0.43-0.95), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (OR: 0.53, 95% CI: 0.42-0.68).

A total of 11,801 20- to 64-year-old adults (age 42.9 ± 11.8 yrs [mean ± standard error of the mean]; male 41.1%, female 58.9%) in 2007-2009 Korean National Health and Nutrition Survey data were divided into 5 groups based on breakfast types in a 24-hr dietary recall: rice with 3 or more side dishes (Rice3+, 35.3%), rice with 0-2 side dishes (Rice0-2, 34.73%), noodles (1.56%), bread and cereal (6.56%), and breakfast skipping (21.63%). Daily nutrient intakes and the risk of metabolic syndrome were compared among five groups. Compared with Korean Recommended Nutrient Intake levels, the breakfast-skipping group showed the lowest intake level in most nutrients, whereas the Rice3+ group showed the highest. Fat intake was higher in the bread and noodle groups than in the other groups. When compared with the Rice3+ group, the odds ratios for the risk of obesity and metabolic syndrome were increased in the breakfast skipping, Rice0-2, and noodle groups after controlling for confounding variables. The rice-based breakfast group showed better nutritional status and health outcomes when eating with 3 or more side dishes. Nutrition education is needed to emphasize both the potential advantage of the rice-based, traditional Korean diet in terms of nutritional content and the importance of food diversity.",

    "abstract": "Doenjang, Korean traditional fermented soybean paste has been reported to have an anti-obesity effect. Because adipose tissue is considered a major source of inflammatory signals, we investigated the protective effects of Doenjang and steamed soybean on oxidative stress and inflammation in adipose tissue of diet-induced obese mice. Male C57BL/6J mice were fed a low fat diet (LF), a high-fat diet (HF), or a high-fat containing Doenjang diet (DJ) or a high-fat containing steamed soybean diet (SS) for 11 weeks. Mice fed a DJ diet showed significantly lower body and adipose tissue weights than those in the HF group. Although no significant differences in adipocyte size and number were observed among the HF diet-fed groups, consumption of Doenjang alleviated the incidence of crown-like structures in adipose tissue. Consistently, we observed significantly reduced mRNA levels of oxidative stress markers (heme oxygenase-1 and p40(phox)), pro-inflammatory adipokines (tumor necrosis factor alpha and macrophage chemoattractant protein-1), macrophage markers (CD68 and CD11c), and a fibrosis marker (transforming growth factor beta 1) by Doenjang consumption. Gene expression of anti-inflammatory adipokine, adiponectin was significantly induced in the DJ group and the SS group compared to the HF group. The anti-oxidative stress and anti-inflammatory effects observed in mice fed an SS diet were not as effective as those in mice fed a DJ diet, suggesting that the bioactive compounds produced during fermentation and aging may be involved in the observed health-beneficial effects of Doenjang. Doenjang alleviated oxidative stress and restored the dysregulated expression of adipokine genes caused by excess adiposity. Therefore, Doenjang may ameliorate systemic inflammation and oxidative stress in obesity via inhibition of inflammatory signals of adipose tissue.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the effect of the vinegar, which is made of 4-year-old mountain-cultivated ginseng ripened into 4-year-matured persimmon vinegar, on the blood lipids level and inflammatory cytokines concentration in obese female adolescents. Subjects ingested the vinegar, so-called 'mountain-cultivated ginseng persimmon vinegar (MPV)', without meals every day for 6 weeks with activities control. Subjects were grouped into control (CON), persimmon vinegar (PV), and MPV with 10 people in each group. Blood lipids, triglyceride (TG), total-cholesterol (TC), and high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) were analyzed. Also, glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT) and glutamate pyruvate transaminase (GPT) were analyzed for the hepatotoxicity. Blood cytokines, interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFκB) were analyzed. Subjects showed a high reduction in body weight and body fat. Their blood lipid level was effectively improved, and the secretion of inflammatory cytokine was suppressed as well, except for TNF-α. However, the change ratio of the cytokines was high in PV and MPV. Such results were similar to those from research subjects who took persimmon vinegar only (PV), but the effect of the vinegar (MPV) was more remarkable. Besides, this mixture was found to have no effect on the hepatotoxicity. The significance of this study is that all the experiments were conducted without controlling research subjects' daily lives, and it is suggested that the vinegar may be recommended as a kind of health supplement food to suppress obesity. Especially, since these two products are traditional foods of Korean people, which have been taken for ages, it is expected that the fusing of two foods may be better applied to ordinary people who are concerned about obesity.",

    "abstract": "Zanthoxylum schinifolium is widely used as a food flavoring in east Asia. Although this plant has also been used in traditional oriental medicine for the treatment of the common cold, toothache, stomach ache, diarrhea and jaundice, its anti-obesity activity remains to be elucidated. The present study investigated the effects of ethanol extract from the leaves of Z. schinifolium (EEZS) on adipocyte differentiation, and its underlying mechanism, in 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes. The results demonstrated that EEZS effectively suppressed intracellular lipid accumulation at non-toxic concentrations, and was associated with the downregulation of several adipocyte-specific transcription factors, including peroxisome proliferation-activity receptor γ (PPARγ), CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP)α and C/EBPβ, in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, it was observed that EEZS markedly inactivated the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) and phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathways, which act upstream of PPARγ and C/EBPs in adipogenesis. These results suggested that EEZS inhibited lipid accumulation by downregulating the major transcription factors involved in the pathway of adipogenesis, including PPARγ, C/EBPα and C/EBPβ, via regulation of the ERK and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways in 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation. This indicated the potential use of EEZS as an anti-obesity agent.",

    "title": "Dietary patterns of Korean adults and the prevalence of metabolic syndrome: a cross-sectional study.",
    "abstract": "The prevalence of metabolic syndrome has been increasing in Korea and has been associated with dietary habits. The aim of our study was to identify the relationship between dietary patterns and the prevalence of metabolic syndrome. Using a validated food frequency questionnaire, we employed a cross-sectional design to assess the dietary intake of 1257 Korean adults aged 31 to 70 years. To determine the participants' dietary patterns, we considered 37 predefined food groups in principal components analysis. Metabolic syndrome was defined according to the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III. The abdominal obesity criterion was modified using Asian guidelines. Prevalence ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the metabolic syndrome were calculated across the quartiles of dietary pattern scores using log binomial regression models. The covariates used in the model were age, sex, total energy intake, tobacco intake, alcohol consumption, and physical activity. The prevalence of metabolic syndrome was 19.8% in men and 14.1% in women. The PCA identified three distinct dietary patterns: the 'traditional' pattern, the 'meat' pattern, and the 'snack' pattern. There was an association of increasing waist circumference and body mass index with increasing score in the meat dietary pattern. The multivariate-adjusted prevalence ratio of metabolic syndrome for the highest quartile of the meat pattern in comparison with the lowest quartile was 1.47 (95% CI: 1.00-2.15, p for trend = 0.016). A positive association between the prevalence of metabolic syndrome and the dietary pattern score was found only for men with the meat dietary pattern (2.15, 95% CI: 1.10-4.21, p for trend = 0.005). The traditional pattern and the snack pattern were not associated with an increased prevalence of metabolic syndrome. The meat dietary pattern was associated with a higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome in Korean male adults.",
