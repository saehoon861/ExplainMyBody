    "title": "Current Affairs of the Heart: Hydration Status in Cardiac Patients Assessed by Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis.",
    "abstract": "Fluid management in patients with cardiovascular disease and after cardiac surgery remains clinically challenging because of the interplay of surgical trauma, effects of anesthesia, and cardiopulmonary bypass. Both restrictive and liberal fluid management strategies are associated with adverse outcomes. At the same time, current methods for assessing hydration status are limited by invasiveness, operator dependence, or poor reliability. Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) offers a rapid, noninvasive, and cost-effective alternative for evaluating hydration and body composition. Through the measurement of resistance and reactance, BIA provides estimations of total, intracellular, and extracellular water, as well as the degree of overhydration, using BIA-derived indices. Bioelectrical impedance vector analysis and phase angle provide further insights into hydration status, cellular integrity, and prognosis. Evidence supports the value of BIA for detecting overhydration, monitoring decongestion, and predicting outcomes such as mortality, rehospitalization, and cardiac cachexia in congenital and chronic heart failure. In acute heart failure, BIA-derived indices are associated with biomarkers, imaging, and clinical improvements while adding diagnostic and prognostic value. In cardiac surgery, perioperative BIA detects shifts in fluid compartments, helps predict postoperative complications, and is associated with intensive care unit and overall hospital length of stay, as well as mechanical ventilation duration. Despite concerns regarding interference with implantable cardiac devices, multiple studies demonstrate its safety in this population. Overall, BIA represents a promising adjunct to conventional monitoring, offering objective and dynamic fluid assessment that may improve individualized management and risk assessment in cardiovascular care.",

    "title": "The trajectories of bioelectrical impedance analysis-derived raw variables (phase angle and impedance ratio) in healthy Italian children and adolescents: a retrospective observational study.",
    "abstract": "There is a growing interest for bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA)-derived raw variables such as phase angle (PhA) and impedance-Z ratio, since they are considered proxy indicators of body cell mass and muscle structure. So far, limited information is available on the trajectories of PhA and IR during the first two decades of life. Anthropometry was measured with standardized procedures. For the whole body, PhA was measured at 50 kHz, while IR was calculated as the ratio of Z at 250 kHz/Z to that 5 kHz. Fat-free mass (FFM) and percentage body fat (%BF) were estimated by BIA. Segmented linear regression was applied to assess whether the relationships between PhA or IR and age showed discontinuities with time. Healthy children and adolescents were enrolled (302 boys and 278 girls aged 6-16 yrs). Independent predictors of PhA were body weight, height, FFM and %BF in boys and age, body weight, height and FFM in girls. Similar findings were observed for IR. PhA increased similarly in both sexes from 6 to 11 yrs. In the second decade the slope was ten times steeper in boys and three times in girls, with a breakpoint around 12 yrs in both sexes. A breakpoint was also detected for IR which was significant in boys only. This study provides a comprehensive description of the trajectories of PhA and IR in healthy children and adolescents. Changes of both variables were associated with age, with breakpoints observed around 11-12 yrs of age, followed by more marked variations with time. What is known: • In children and adolescents, BIA-derived raw variables, such as phase angle and impedance ratio, have been related to muscle strength and cardiorespiratory fitness and were considered as a marker of outcome in hospitalized paediatric patients. • A limited number of papers described the trajectory of these variables in paediatric population. What is new: • There are very clear age-related differences in BIA-derived variables over the first two decades of life, with a variability related to variation in fat-free mass. • For both variables, breakpoints were observed particularly in boys around 12 yrs of age.",

    "abstract": "Total hip arthroplasty (THA) in obese patients (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m²) is technically more demanding and associated with a higher risk of postoperative morbidity. Its realization seems more complex by the direct anterior approach. The hypothesis was that muscular mass would have a stronger impact than BMI on intraoperative difficulty during anterior THA. The study objectives were; 1. To assess the influence of body composition and BMI on intraoperative difficulty, 2. To determine the influence of body composition on early complications (< 3 months) and short-term functional outcomes. A total of 162 anterior approach THAs without traction table were included. Body composition (muscle and fat mass) was assessed preoperatively by bioelectrical impedance analysis of the operated limb and trunk. Subgroup analyses were performed according to BMI (< 30, 30-35, or ≥ 35) and muscle mass (threshold set at 67%). Intraoperative difficulty was evaluated based on operative time in minutes and total blood loss in mL, calculated using the OSTHEO formula. Perioperative complications, early complications (< 3 months), and 3-month functional outcomes (Oxford Hip Score and Forgotten Joint Score) were assessed. In univariate analysis, operative time (+19 min) and total blood loss (+615 mL) were significantly higher in patients with BMI ≥ 35 compared to those with BMI < 30 (p <  0.001). Operative time was also longer (+6 min) in muscular patients (≥ 67%) (p =  0.009), with no significant difference in total blood loss. No significant differences were observed in perioperative or early postoperative complications, nor in 3-month functional outcomes between obese/non-obese or muscular/non-muscular groups. In multivariate analysis, BMI and total muscle mass were independently associated with intraoperative difficulty: Operative time (min) = 22.2 + 0.25 × total muscle mass (kg) + 1.1 × BMI (R² = 0.24, p <  0.001) Total blood loss (mL) = -692.6 + 13.3 × total muscle mass (kg) + 31.1 × BMI (R² = 0.29, p <  0.001) CONCLUSION: BMI and total muscle mass are two preoperative factors associated with greater intraoperative difficulty, as reflected by increased operative time and total blood loss in anterior approach THA. These factors can be anticipated through a more detailed assessment of body composition. Despite the increased surgical complexity, they do not appear to be associated with a higher risk of early postoperative complications. In this cohort, muscle mass did not demonstrate a stronger impact than BMI on operative difficulty, contrary to the initial hypothesis. II; Prospective comparative study.",

    "abstract": "Rapid weight loss with restricted diets can cause muscle mass decline. The aim of this work is to evaluate a new method for representing the raw electrical values obtained in the bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) in patients with obesity and osteoarthritis undergoing a meal-replacement diet. We conducted a 1-group intervention study with meal-replacement diet for 3 months in patients with osteoarthritis prior to orthopedic surgery. Anthropometry and BIA was registered at baseline (B) and 3 months (3M) after the intervention. We have calculated traditional estimations of body composition over the raw electrical parameters of BIA parameters and a new bioelectrical impedance vector analysis (BIVA) based method to detect nutrition (NP), hydration (HP) and fat (FP) parameters without estimation. A total of 272 patients (23.16% men; 76.84% women) were analyzed. There was a correlation between NP and body composition estimates (body cell mass [BCM] standardized by height (BCM/h): men: 0.96; p<0.01; women: 0.88; p<0.01). The correlation coefficient between HP and estimated total body water was 0.769 for men and 0.63 for women (p<0.01 in both cases). The correlation coefficient between FP and estimated fat mass (FM) standardized by height was 0.83 for men and 0.89 for women (p<0.01). There was a significant decrease in body weight (B: 99.33(15.0)kg; 3M: 92.03(16.0)kg; p<0.01); and FM (B: 49.93(6.67)kg; 3M: 44.22(9.08)kg). There was no difference in BCM and fat free mass. In new parameters a decrease in NP (B: +0.50(0.31); 3M: +0.42(0.42); p=0.03) and FP (B: +0.49(0.17) was reported; 3M: +0.38(0.16); p<0.01), although there was no difference in HP. The new interpretation of BIVA as NP and HP have a high correlation with the body composition parameters estimated by regression models, and they report changes in body composition after a partial meal-replacement diet such as regression equations.",

The SG participated in a regimen consisting of 45 min of conventional physiotherapy combined with 30 min of telerehabilitation-based aerobic exercise, conducted 3 times per week for 8 weeks. The CG received only conventional physiotherapy with the same frequency and duration. Pre- and post-treatment measurements were taken, including body composition (muscle mass, body fat percentage, body weight) assessed through bioelectrical impedance analysis, physical performance evaluated via the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), muscular endurance measured with the 30-s stand-and-sit test, and treatment satisfaction assessed using the visual analog scale.ResultsThe SG demonstrated significant improvements in physical performance (p = 0.01) and muscular endurance (p < 0.001) compared to the CG. However, there was no superority of SG compared to the CG for body composition parameters. (p > 0.05, for all) Within-group comparisons revealed that SG showed significant improvements in body composition measurements (p < 0.001), while no significant changes were observed in the CG for either all parameters. (p > 0.05, for all).ConclusionTelerehabilitation-based aerobic exercise proves to be an effective intervention for enhancing physical fitness in individuals with epilepsy.",

This retrospective study was conducted between January 2018 and January 2023 and included 159 TGD adolescents (109 TGD males) aged ≤21 years and treated with gender-affirming hormones. Body composition was assessed by bioelectrical impedance analysis. Anthropometric measurements, treatment dose, and hormone levels were extracted from medical files. The outcome measures were estradiol and testosterone levels in correlation with indices of adiposity and muscle adjusted for treatment dose and duration. Peak testosterone blood levels, adjusted for dose and treatment duration, correlated negatively with body mass index z-score ( Our results demonstrate an association between both adipose and muscle mass and testosterone levels. This is of special importance, as TGD youth exhibit a higher frequency of differing weight status and body composition. These findings enable a more individualized approach to medication dosing for TGD adolescents. Body surface area may be a potential indicator for determining the appropriate testosterone dose in cases where data on body composition are unavailable.",

    "title": "Body Composition Analysis Methods in Adolescent Athletes: A Systematic Review.",
    "abstract": "Body composition analysis in adolescent athletes is critical for assessing fat mass percentage and fat-free mass. However, measurement inaccuracies can compromise results. Additionally, there is a lack of reliable reference methods to evaluate the accuracy of field measurement techniques. This review evaluates the reliability and validity of methods in adolescent athletes and provides evidence-based recommendations for best practice. The search (Pubmed and Scopus) followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and PICO criteria related to adolescent athletes in bioelectrical impedance analysis, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, air displacement plethysmography and skinfold thickness measurements. Thirty-one studies out of 4,408 records met the eligibility criteria. Estimating fat mass percentage and fat-free mass in adolescent athletes is moderately reliable and valid. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry is often regarded as the criterion standard particularly for validating equations in bioelectrical impedance analysis and skinfold measurements. Its assumptions regarding tissue density and confounding factors limit precision. Air displacement plethysmography and hydrostatic weighing are limited in athletes with extreme body mass or atypical fat distribution. Recent calculation formulas validated for adolescents are rare and inadequate for athletes. In summary, two- and three-compartment models reflect reduced accuracy in adolescent athletes, making four-compartment models preferable. Field methods like bioelectrical impedance analysis and skinfolds require further validation due to the lack of reliable reference methods in this specific population.",

    "title": "Identification of Sarcopenic Obesity by Fat-to-Muscle Ratio in Older Adults: A Cohort Study.",
    "abstract": "The diagnosis of sarcopenic obesity has been established in Europe and Japan, but screening tools remain inconsistent and lack standardization. The fat-to-muscle ratio (FMR) is a potential screening measure for sarcopenic obesity; however, its diagnostic accuracy compared with other tools has not been evaluated. This study compared the diagnostic performance of several screening tools for sarcopenic obesity. This cross-sectional analysis used data from the National Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology Study of Geriatric Syndromes (NCGG-SGS), a national cohort study conducted in Japan. In total, 7916 community-dwelling older adults (mean ± standard deviation age 73.5 ± 6.2 years, 54.8% females) were included. Sarcopenic obesity was diagnosed by the Japanese Working Group on Sarcopenic Obesity (JWGSO) criteria. The FMR and phase angle (PhA) were measured using the bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). Logistic regression analysis indicated that most screening tools, treated as continuous variables, were independently associated with sarcopenic obesity after adjustment for covariates; FMR (female: per 1-SD odds ratio [OR] = 3.06, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.53-3.71; male: OR = 3.09, 95% CI = 2.67-3.58), BMI (female: OR = 2.85, 95% CI = 2.35-3.58; male: OR = 1.43, 95% CI = 1.26-1.62), waist circumference (WC) (female: OR = 2.26, 95% CI = 1.86-2.74; male: OR = 1.24, 95% CI = 1.08-1.41) and PhA (female: OR = 1.12, 95% CI = 0.93-1.34; male: OR = 0.65, 95% CI = 0.56-0.76). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis showed moderate predictive ability for each screening tool: FMR (female: area under the curve [AUC] = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.79-0.85; male: AUC = 0.81, 95% CI = 0.79-0.84), BMI (female: AUC = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.72-0.79; male: AUC = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.51-0.59), WC (female: AUC = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.66-0.75; male: AUC = 0.53, 95% CI = 0.49-0.57) and PhA (female: AUC = 0.63, 95% CI = 0.58-0.69; male: AUC = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.67-0.74). The findings suggest that the FMR is a more effective screening tool for identifying sarcopenic obesity than BMI, WC or PhA among community-dwelling older adults. Longitudinal studies are needed to confirm its predictive value across broader populations.",

    "abstract": "Monitoring body composition is crucial for optimizing performance and preventing injuries in young athletes during a competitive season. This study evaluated changes in body composition and bioelectrical impedance vector analysis (BIVA) in 15 male U17 Italian national handball players (age: 16.44±0.60 years). Bioelectrical parameters were analyzed across four time points: end of the season (T0), pre-season (T1), season onset (T2), and winter break (T3), using repeated measures mixed models, while Mahalanobis' tests track vector shifts and ellipse distances (D). Statistical significance was set at P<0.05. The vector significantly lengthened from T0 to T1 (D=1.95), then shortened from T1 to T2 (D=1.63) and T2 to T3 (D=0.88). Stature-adjusted resistance significantly decreased at T2 (262.9 Ω/m±26.1) compared to T1 (275.6 Ω/m±27.8) and at T3 (249.7 Ω/m±21.4) compared to T0 (269.7 Ω/m±27.9), T1, and T2. Stature-adjusted reactance significantly increased at T1 (39.00 Ω/m±3.7) compared to T0 (35.3 Ω/m±3.6) then decreased at T2 (36.2 Ω/m±3.2) and T3 (35.7 Ω/m±3.4) compared to T1. From T0 to T3, phase angle, total body water, and fat-free mass increased significantly from 7.4°±0.5 to 8.1±0.6°, 59.9±3.6% to 61.1±3.7%, and 82.0±4.5% to 84.0±5.1%, respectively.

Miscarriage is also relatively common in dialysis patients. However, there are no established guidelines regarding dialysis initiation or fluid management in pregnant women with renal failure. CASE REPORT A 41-year-old Japanese woman had been diagnosed with IgA nephropathy at age 17 following abnormal urinalysis, but subsequently discontinued medical follow-up. Later, she became pregnant and was diagnosed with CKD stage G4 at 6 weeks of gestation (estimated glomerular filtration rate: 28.2 mL/min/1.73 m²). Despite being informed of her high-risk status, she strongly wished to continue the pregnancy. Management included salt restriction, antihypertensive therapy, and close monitoring. At 31 weeks, worsening renal function and hypertension prompted the initiation of hemodialysis. Body fluid status was assessed using bioelectrical impedance analysis and the amniotic fluid index. Dialysis parameters were adjusted to avoid fetal compromise. Vaginal delivery occurred at 36 weeks. Hemodialysis was discontinued on postpartum day 6 following improvement in renal function, and both mother and infant were discharged without complications. CONCLUSIONS This case illustrates that individualized fluid control and close inpatient monitoring can enable both the continuation of pregnancy and successful dialysis withdrawal in patients with advanced CKD. Body composition monitoring may serve as a useful tool for managing fluid balance during pregnancy-related dialysis. This report contributes to the limited literature on dynamic dialysis decision-making in pregnant CKD patients.",

    "abstract": "Water plays a vital role in muscle function, and its distribution between intracellular (ICW) and extracellular (ECW) compartments serves as a key indicator of muscle quality. Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) quantifies body water (BW), while myotonometry measures muscle mechanical properties; however, the relationship between these measures remains underexplored. This study aimed to assess the association between BW compartments and the resting mechanical properties of lower limb muscles. A total of 158 healthy adults (97 men, 61 women; mean age 20.8 years) participated. BW compartments, including total body water (TBW), ICW, and ECW, were measured using a multi-frequency body composition analyser (TANITA MC-780 MA). A MyotonPRO® device assessed the mechanical properties (e.g. tone, stiffness) in the tibialis anterior, peroneus longus, and gastrocnemius muscles. Spearman's rank correlation and multiple linear regression models were used to analyse the relationships between BIA and myotonometry. The analysis revealed a consistent bipolar pattern of associations. Absolute hydration volumes (TBW, ICW, ECW expressed in kilograms) were positively correlated with muscle tone and stiffness, with correlations ranging from weak to high (r ≈ 0.30-0.70, p < 0.001). ICW was the strongest determinant. In contrast, relative ECW (expressed as a percentage) showed moderate negative correlations with tone and stiffness. This pattern was consistent across all muscles and between limbs. In healthy young adults, the resting mechanical properties of lower limb muscles are significantly associated not only with TBW but, more importantly, with its compartmental distribution. Higher ICW corresponds to greater muscle tone and stiffness, whereas a high ECW proportion is linked to lower values.",

    "title": "Safety of bioelectrical impedance analysis in patients with cardiac implantable electronic devices: A systematic review.",
    "abstract": "Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is widely used to assess body composition. However, its safety in patients with cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) remains uncertain owing to potential electromagnetic interference (EMI). This study aimed to evaluate potential complications associated with clinical-grade BIA use in patients with CIEDs, based on currently available evidence. We conducted a systematic review of studies published up to December 26, 2024, identified through PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library. The primary outcome was the occurrence of adverse events, including EMI, device malfunction, or arrhythmias. Of 3668 records, 6 cohort studies (n = 531 patients) met the inclusion criteria. These included patients with pacemakers (n = 175), implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (n = 268), and cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillators (n = 154). BIA protocols varied in frequency (5-500 kHz) and current intensity (typically ≤0.8 mA). No study reported clinically significant EMI, device malfunctions, or BIA-induced arrhythmias. Device parameters (eg, lead impedance, pacing thresholds) remained stable before and after BIA exposure. Risk of bias was rated as good in 1 study and fair in 5. Current evidence suggests that clinical-grade BIA is safe in patients with CIEDs, with no reported adverse effects or device interferences. These findings contribute to informing and potentially updating previous recommendations that discouraged BIA in this population. However, further high-quality studies are needed to confirm safety across different BIA protocols and device types. Importantly, these findings apply to clinical-grade BIA and should not be extrapolated to consumer-grade wearables, which may present a theoretical risk of CIED interference.",

    "abstract": "Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) is a metabolically active visceral fat depot contributing to coronary atherosclerosis, yet the molecular mechanisms underlying EAT-related coronary artery disease (CAD) in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) remain unclear. Previously, we identified novel circulating miRNAs targeting fatty acid metabolism in T2DM-CAD. This study aimed to investigate whether EAT may explain the association between dysregulated hsa-miR-4505, hsa-miR-4743-5p, hsa-miR-4750-3p and CAD in T2DM patients and whether it can detect diabetic atherosclerosis alone or in a multi-modal combination. Seventy-six patients with T2DM and/or CAD along with eighteen healthy controls were enrolled in the study. All participants underwent transthoracic echocardiography to assess EAT thickness on the free wall of the right ventricle at end-systole and bioelectrical impedance analysis for body composition determination. Spearman's rank correlation and multivariate linear regression accounting for relevant clinical confounders were used to explore the associations between EAT and miRNAs. To further investigate whether EAT acts as an intermediary between miRNA and CAD in T2DM, causal mediation analysis was employed. The receiver operating characteristics curves were generated to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the combined models built using multivariate logistic regression. The median EAT thickness was significantly higher in T2DM-CAD patients compared to T2DM subjects and controls (p < 0.0001). The bivariate analysis showed a positive correlation between triglyceride concentration and EAT thickness, and a negative one with hsa-miR-4750-3p expression. After multivariable adjustment, hsa-miR-4750-3p (β = - 0.445, p = 0.003) emerged as a standalone predictor of EAT thickness. Logistic regression analysis identified enlarged EAT, up-regulated hsa-miR-4505, hsa-miR-4743-5p and down-regulated hsa-miR-4750-3p to be independently associated with higher CAD risk in T2DM. Adding miRNAs to EAT improved CAD detection in T2DM (AUC = 0.988), outperforming both EAT (AUC = 0.869), clinical factors (AUC = 0.829), and their combination (AUC = 0.901). The mediation analysis revealed that EAT accounted for 48.79% of the total effect of hsa-miR-4750-3p on CAD in T2DM. These findings suggest that the proposed miRNA-EAT regulatory axis may be involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic atherosclerosis, with EAT appearing to partially mediate the relationship between hsa-miR-4750-3p and CAD. The integrated approach linking EAT and miRNAs holds potential for CAD risk stratification in T2DM.",

    "abstract": "Frailty is increasingly recognized in schizophrenia and is linked to adverse outcomes such as fall. However, mechanisms connecting body composition to frailty and fall risk in psychiatric inpatients remain insufficiently understood. This study aimed to examine (1) the association between fat-free mass and frailty; (2) the relationship between frailty and fall in the past 12 months; and (3) which frailty components most strongly relate to fall among inpatients with schizophrenia. In this cross-sectional study, 195 hospitalized adults (≥40 years; mean age 65.9 years) with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder were assessed. Frailty was defined using the Japanese version of the Cardiovascular Health Study (J-CHS) criteria. Body composition was measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis to compute fat-free mass index (FFMI) and fat mass index (FMI). Frailty prevalence was 32.8% (prefrail 54.9%; robust 12.3%). Higher FFMI was independently associated with lower odds of being frail. Frailty was strongly associated with fall history (OR = 9.85 vs. prefrail/robust). Across individual frailty components, slowness (reduced gait speed) showed the strongest relationship with fall. Frailty is highly prevalent among inpatients with schizophrenia and strongly predicts fall risk. Among the individual frailty components, slowness was the key driver of fall, pointing to gait impairment as a critical focus for intervention. Routine gait assessment, combined with physiotherapy, nutritional support, and careful medication review, may help reduce frailty and prevent fall in this population. Prospective studies are needed to confirm these associations and to establish effective strategies for fall prevention in schizophrenia.",

    "title": "Relationship Between Salivary Metabolites and Skeletal Muscle Index in Older Male Patients: A Retrospective Observational Pilot Study to Identify Potential Biomarkers.",
    "abstract": "Nutritional assessment during the perioperative period is critical, particularly for older patients at high risk for complications. Bioelectrical impedance analysis (e.g., InBody) is commonly used to assess skeletal muscle mass via the skeletal muscle index (SMI). However, its use is limited in patients with contraindications, including implantable cardiac devices. Therefore, this study explored a noninvasive alternative: assessing the relationship between salivary metabolites and SMI to identify potential biomarkers associated with muscle mass. This retrospective study analyzed data from male preoperative patients who had both InBody analysis and salivary metabolomics data collected between January 2021 and March 2024. Salivary metabolites, including butyrate and hexanoate, were quantified using capillary electrophoresis time-of-flight mass spectrometry (CE-TOF MS). Body composition parameters, including SMI, and blood nutritional indicators, were obtained. Volcano plot analysis identified metabolites significantly differing between patients with SMI ≥ 7.0 and < 7.0 kg/m Patients with low SMI were significantly older than those with high SMI. While body composition indices differed significantly, general nutritional blood markers remained comparable. Volcano plot analysis showed significantly higher salivary butyrate and hexanoate levels in patients with SMI ≥ 7.0 kg/m This exploratory study suggests that salivary metabolites, particularly butyrate and hexanoate, along with age, may serve as potential indicators for discriminating SMI status. These findings suggest the potential utility of salivary metabolites as noninvasive biomarkers for assessing muscle mass in the perioperative setting. This could enable early sarcopenia detection and enhanced nutritional management in older patients, particularly those with contraindications. ",

    "abstract": "Sarcopenia, marked by muscle loss and weakness, is common in cirrhotic patients undergoing liver transplantation and is associated with poor postoperative outcomes. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of pre-transplant sarcopenia, assessed through handgrip strength (HGS), skeletal muscle indices (SMIs), bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), and the 6-min walk test (6MWT), on post-transplant mortality and hospital length of stay (LOS). This retrospective cohort study was conducted on 127 cirrhotic patients who underwent liver transplantation between 2022 and 2023. Pre-transplant assessments included 6MWT, BIA, HGS, and SMI, and their associations with post-transplant outcomes, including LOS and mortality, were analyzed using Cox and linear regression models. In the fully adjusted model, a 6-min walk distance (6MWD) greater than 450 m was associated with a 76% reduction in the risk of mortality (HR = 0.24, p-trend = 0.049). Higher lean body mass to fat mass (LBM/FM) and stronger HGS were linked to reduced mortality (HR = 0.33, 95% CI 0.1-0.99 and HR = 0.17, 95% CI 0.04-0.73, respectively). SMI at T12 and L3 levels was associated with shorter LOS (p = 0.047 and p = 0.035, respectively). Pre-transplant muscle function and quality were linked to post-transplant outcomes. Higher LBM/FM and stronger HGS were associated with lower mortality, while higher T12 and L3 SMIs correlated with shorter hospital stays, emphasizing the importance of muscle assessments in pre-transplant evaluations. Our data indicate that sarcopenia is a strong predictor of liver transplant prognosis; management of sarcopenia before liver transplantation may reduce mortality.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to assess the accuracy of bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) in estimating fat-free mass in growing pigs using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) as the reference method. A longitudinal evaluation was conducted on thirty-nine immunocastrated Landrace × Large White male pigs, with initial and final body weights of 23.1 ± 1.5 kg and 127.4 ± 10.5 kg, respectively, across four growth stages. Lean and fat-free mass were determined by DXA using the Lunar enCORE software (version 8.10.027), whereas BIA measured body resistance (Rs) and reactance (Xc), from which fat-free mass was predicted using established models. The agreement between methods was assessed using Pearson correlations, ANOVA, and mean square prediction error (MSPE) decomposition into errors of central tendency (ECT), regression (ER), and disturbance (ED). Furthermore, non-significant differences (P > 0.05) indicate that the models are in agreement and provide no evidence of predictive bias, supporting the reliability of the predictions. All BIA models exhibited a high correlation with the DXA-derived values (r > 0.93), although the predictive accuracy varied. The Swantek, Marchello, Tilton, and Crenshaw (1999) model demonstrated the best performance for lean and fat-free mass (P > 0.05), with MSPE values up to 45 % lower than those of the other available models, indicating superior predictive reliability for lean and fat-free mass estimation. For protein + water, the Swantek, Crenshaw, Marchello, and Lukaski (1992) model was the most accurate (P > 0.05), with MSPE values 69 % lower than those of Swantek et al. (1999) and over 96 % lower than those of Marchello, Berg, Swantek, and Tilton (1999), suggesting enhanced predictive reliability for protein + water estimation. To our knowledge, this is the first longitudinal study to evaluate multiple BIA models in pigs across a wide weight range. These findings demonstrate that BIA is a practical and non-invasive method for estimating body composition in swine, reinforcing the need for updated prediction equations.",

FFM to FM ratios increased significantly in both groups, with surgical patients maintaining a higher ratio throughout: the FFM to FM ratios in the surgery group were 1.8 (95% CI, 1.8-1.8) at 6 months, 2.1 (95% CI, 2.1-2.1) at 12 months, and 2.0 (95% CI, 2.0-2.1) at 24 months; the FFM to FM ratios in the GLP-1RA group were 1.4 (95% CI, 1.4-1.4) at 6 months, 1.5 (95% CI, 1.4-1.5) at 12 months, and 1.5 (95% CI, 1.5-1.6) at 24 months. Similar trends were observed in stratified analyses by sex, race, baseline BMI, baseline diabetes status, and GLP-1RA treatment duration, although men showed better FFM preservation than women, especially after GLP-1RA treatment. In this single-center cohort study, both bariatric surgery and semaglutide or tirzepatide treatment were associated with substantial FM loss, moderate FFM loss, and improved FFM to FM ratio. These findings provide evidence to guide interventions aimed at preserving FFM while promoting fat loss.",

    "abstract": "This review provides a comprehensive synthesis of validated prediction equations for body composition assessment using single- and multi-frequency bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), covering studies published between 2000 and April 2025. While traditional models for estimating compartments such as total body water (TBW) and fat-free mass (FFM) have long been established, they often fail to reflect current populations and technologies. The review includes 43 studies that developed 98 unique equations for TBW, FFM, extracellular water (ECW), intracellular water (ICW), body cell mass (BCM), and bone mineral content (BMC), derived using reference methods such as deuterium dilution, DXA, or multi-component models. Most equations targeted FFM and TBW, with a noticeable lack of models for ECW, ICW, and BMC. The review identifies a geographic and demographic imbalance in study populations and emphasizes the need for updated, population-specific models. It also highlights the growing use of multi-frequency BIA devices to improve estimation accuracy. The findings support the continued refinement of BIA-based prediction models for broader clinical applicability and underscore the importance of external validation across diverse populations and health conditions.

    "abstract": "Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is common among adolescent athletes, particularly baseball players; however, its association with body composition remains unclear. To investigate the relationship between body composition parameters and the presence of CLBP in high-school baseball players. Retrospective cohort study. Male high-school baseball players were recruited and divided into the CLBP and non-CLBP groups. CLBP was defined as low back pain rated ≥3 on the numerical rating scale (NRS) and lasting >12 weeks. Body composition was measured using bioelectrical impedance analysis in the first year of high school. Logistic regression was used to identify the factors associated with CLBP. Ninety male baseball players participated (mean age: 16.8±0.4 years, during second year). The CLBP group (n=31) showed significantly higher percentage body fat (PBF), body fat mass (BFM), BFM index, and trunk fat mass compared with the non-LBP group (n=59). Logistic regression analysis identified first-year NRS scores (odds ratio [OR]: 2.10; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.46-3.21) and PBF (OR: 1.26; 95% CI: 1.05-1.51) as significant predictors of CLBP. Elevated body fat percentage and elevated pain intensity in early high-school years were associated with the development of CLBP among high-school baseball players. Regular monitoring of body composition and early intervention based on pain levels may effectively prevent CLBP in adolescent baseball players, thereby supporting better long-term athletic performance and health outcomes. 3b.",

    "abstract": "Reference data for bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) parameters remain limited in youth, making sarcopenia assessment challenging. This study aimed to establish BIA reference values and determine sarcopenia cutoff points and prevalence in youth. This cross-sectional study analyzed 1451 youth aged 10-25 years who underwent BIA using data from a nationwide survey. Reference values for body composition were established using the least mean squares method, which estimates age-specific percentiles. Sarcopenia was defined using skeletal muscle mass index (SMI), fat-free mass-to-fat ratio (FFM-MFR), and appendicular skeletal muscle mass-to-fat ratio (ASM-MFR) with age- and sex-specific cutoff values. Muscle-related parameters, including fat-free mass, fat-free mass index, ASM, and SMI, increased during puberty in both sexes, with a more pronounced increase in males, followed by a plateau or gradual increase after adolescence. Fat-related parameters, including fat mass, fat mass index, and percentage body fat, decreased until age 14 years in males before increasing, whereas in females, they increased until adolescence and declined after early adulthood. The prevalence of sarcopenia was 2.05% in males and 1.04% in females based on SMI, 5.21% in males and 6.38% in females based on FFM-MFR, and 5.06% in males and 5.79% in females based on ASM-MFR. This study established BIA-based body composition reference values for youth using nationally representative data, identified age- and sex-specific sarcopenia cutoff points and prevalence estimates, and highlighted age- and sex-specific differences. These findings provide a valuable resource for the early identification and management of sarcopenia in youth.",

    "abstract": "Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) measures a parameter known as Phase Angle (PhA) which reflects the cellular health. This study assessed changes in PhA and association with anthropometric and body composition parameters in children with severe acute malnutrition (SAM). A longitudinal observational follow-up study was conducted among hospitalized children aged 12-59 months with SAM, treated at a Nutrition Rehabilitation Centre. Anthropometry and BIA, including PhA data and analyses, were performed at admission, at discharge, and 11-weeks post-discharge follow-up. Of the 141 children enrolled, 136 were successfully discharged following treatment of medical complications and stabilization. Of these, 106 (75.2%) completed nutritional rehabilitation and follow-up of 11 weeks. The median (q1, q3) hospital stay was 10 (6, 14) days with mean (SD) daily weight gain of 3.50 (- 1.8) g/kg/day. Lower PhA values were observed in children aged 24-59 months, with edema, and those from low-income households. PhA positively correlated with weight-for-height (WHZ) and body-cell-mass-index, and negatively with extracellular water. There was no significant difference in PhA (at baseline or follow-up) between those who achieved complete cure (30.2%), partial cure (51.9%) or remained SAM (17.9%). A multivariable linear regression model (R PhA can be a complementary marker of cellular health and nutritional recovery in SAM children.

    "abstract": "Bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy (BIS) is a valuable tool for assessing body composition in patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD), as body composition can significantly change during long-term PD treatment. We aimed to clarify the relationship between time-dependent changes in the extracellular-to-intracellular water ratio (EIR) and all-cause mortality in patients undergoing long-term PD. A single-center, retrospective cohort study. This study enrolled adult PD patients who underwent body composition measurements from our bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy-aided fluid management program from May 1, 2012, to April 30, 2023. Patients were followed up until death, withdrawal from PD, or the end of the study. EIR and its covariates. All-cause mortality. Time-dependent Cox proportional hazards, restricted cubic splines, and propensity score matching analyzed risk factors and mortality. Among the 468 PD patients, the median follow-up period was 2.0 (interquartile range [IQR] 0.6-4.3) years. Three distinct temporal EIR trajectories are found after grouping baseline EIR (bEIR) into quartiles ( The study had a retrospective design. The EIR, regarded as either a time-independent or time-dependent variable, is a crucial predictor of mortality in PD patients under regular monitoring of fluid status. Our results also suggest that an EIR of ≥0.87 would be a useful target for predicting the long-term mortality of PD patients in clinical practice. Fluid overload-induced cardiovascular disease has long been one of the leading causes of mortality in dialysis patients. In this study, we used time-dependent Cox proportional hazards regression analysis and found that the extracellular-to-intracellular water ratio (EIR), as measured by bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy, can predict the mortality risk in peritoneal dialysis patients. Over the course of dialysis, the bEIR quartile groups exhibited 3 distinct trajectories. Except for the fourth bEIR quartile (Q4) group, which showed an initial decrease in EIR due to intervention for fluid overload, the other two groups demonstrated an upward trend, with the first bEIR quartile (Q1) group showing the greatest increase.",

    "abstract": "Reliable normative references for adolescent body composition are essential for screening and surveillance, yet Brazilian data at national scale remain scarce and heterogeneous across methods and devices. To generate age- and sex-specific reference curves for phase angle (PhA), skeletal muscle mass index (SMMI), and muscle-to-fat ratio (MFR) in Brazilian adolescents, and to present device- dependent body fat percentage (%BF) percentiles as secondary, interpretation- cautioned outputs. We analyzed a frozen, de-identified extract of routine multi- frequency bioimpedance assessments (10.00-19.99 years) spanning all five Brazilian macro-regions and multiple recruitment contexts (schools, clinics/primary care, private practices, gyms/fitness centers, community programs). The extract is produced by a vendor privacy/QA pipeline compliant with LGPD; upstream cleaning logs are not accessible to the authors. Prespecified plausibility and deduplication rules (anthropometry and impedance thresholds; robust BIVA on R/H and Xc/H) were re- applied and yielded no additional exclusions. Sex-specific age curves were modeled with GAMLSS (LMS) to estimate smoothed percentiles (P3, P10, P25, P50, P75, P90, P97). %BF, derived from a proprietary embedded equation, is reported as secondary. The analytic cohort comprised 59,000 adolescents from all macro-regions and diverse contexts. Median PhA, SMMI, and MFR increased with age in boys and showed the expected attenuated or plateauing patterns in girls across mid- to late adolescence. Percentile spreads widened with age for muscle-related indices, indicating growing interindividual variability. Device-dependent %BF percentiles exhibited age- and sex- specific trajectories consistent with physiological expectations but should be interpreted with caution pending external validation. We provide national reference percentiles for PhA, SMMI, and MFR that are immediately useful for clinical and public- health applications and less sensitive to device-specific assumptions. %BF curves are offered as secondary and require independent validation against a criterion method before routine use. Future work should confirm regional representativeness and cross-device portability.",

    "abstract": "Sleeve gastrectomy (SG) is an effective bariatric procedure but often results in rapid fat-free mass (FFM) loss during the early postoperative period, which may impair recovery and metabolic stability. This study evaluated the effects of different protein supplements low-BCAA soy peptide-based (LBP), whey protein-based (WP), and compound protein-based (CP) on FFM preservation one month after SG. A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 200 SG patients categorized by postoperative protein supplementation strategy. Body composition was assessed using bioelectrical impedance analysis before and one month after surgery. Primary outcomes included changes in total and regional FFM, with subgroup analyses based on age, sex, and baseline FFM. Covariate-adjusted comparisons controlled for age, sex, and baseline BMI. At one month postoperatively, the LBP group demonstrated significantly lower percentage FFM loss from total weight loss (%FFML/WL) and smaller reductions in absolute FFM compared to the CP and WP groups (p < 0.05). These differences remained significant after adjustment. Subgroup analysis indicated greater FFM preservation in female patients, those under 30 years of age, and patients with baseline FFM ≤ 50 kg. Low-BCAA soy peptide supplementation was associated with superior early FFM preservation after SG, particularly in younger and leaner patients. These findings suggest that LBP may be an effective component of early postoperative nutritional care to minimize muscle loss and highlight the combined importance of adequate protein intake and physical activity in optimizing lean mass preservation.",

    "abstract": "The present study aimed to investigate the effects of specially designed training program based on multicomponent and stability exercises on body composition, physical fitness, and functional movement capability in active older women. Thirty active older women (age 69.37 ± 3.66 years; body height 162.59 ± 6.14 cm; body mass 71.25 ± 8.08 kg) were divided into an intervention group (IG, n = 15) and a control group (CG, n = 15). The IG performed 14 weeks of a specially designed training program. Body composition parameters (muscle mass, fat mass, body mass, basal metabolic rate, and visceral fat mass) were assessed using Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis. Physical fitness was measured with Single-Leg Stance (SLS), 8-ft-up-and-go test (8UG), 30-s chair stand test (30-s CST), and Handgrip strength test left/right hand (HGS L/R). The functional movement capability was measured with a Functional Movement Screen (FMS). After 14 weeks IG significantly improved (p < 0.001) parameters of body composition (muscle mass, fat mass, body mass, body mass index) and physical fitness (8UG, 30-s CST, SLS, HST-R) compared to CG. The improvements in all FMS tests (Deep Squat, Hurdle Step, In-Lune Lunge, Shoulder mobility, Active Straight Leg Raise, Trunk Stability Push-Up, and Rotary Stability) were greater in the IG compared to the CG (p < 0.001). In addition, IG showed higher Total FMS score compared to CG (p < 0.001). The combination of multicomponent and stability exercises as a novel approach is a convincing strategy that can improve body composition, physical fitness, and functional movement capability among active older women.",

    "abstract": "This investigation evaluated the relationships between skeletal muscle mass (SMM), fat-free mass (FFM), and hydration status measured through saliva osmolality (SOSM). It was hypothesized that SMM and FFM would positively associate with SOSM. A cross-sectional, observational study. Laboratory and field collection. Seventy-two adults (42 men, 30 women; 29.3 ± 10.6 years, 171 ± 9 cm, 78.8 ± 15.0 kg, 28.7% ± 8.1% body fat). Skeletal muscle mass and FFM were measured through bioelectrical impedance analysis. Saliva osmolality was measured using the MX3 Hydration Testing System, a portable, noninvasive osmometer. Participants presented 2 saliva samples 3 to 5 minutes apart. Fluid intake was avoided for at least 5 minutes before sampling. Linear regression analysis showed a nonsignificant association between SMM and SOSM (unstandardized B = 0.44, P = 0.144), as well as FFM and SOSM (unstandardized B = 0.23, P = 0.172). The adjusted analysis including covariates (age, sex, past 4-hour fluid intake, and time of sampling) showed nearly no effect, with insignificant associations between SMM and SOSM (unstandardized B = 0.98, P = 0.146) and FFM and SOSM (unstandardized B = 0.44, P = 0.173) remaining. Similarly, Spearman correlation coefficients between SMM and SOSM [ρ(72) = 0.10, P = 0.427] as well as FFM and SOSM [ρ(72) = 0.08 P = 0.487] were positive but nonsignificant and small. Despite growing evidence that urinary hydration biomarkers naturally vary with SMM and FFM, these 2 body composition variables seem to be insignificantly associated with hydration status according to SOSM. This may be related to relatively small concentrations of muscle metabolites (eg, creatinine, uric acid, urea) found in saliva.",

    "abstract": "The global increase in obesity highlights the need for accurate tools to assess body composition and monitor treatment efficacy. Traditional metrics, including body mass index and waist circumference, offer limited precision for fat quantification. Imaging-based techniques capable of visualizing internal structures are increasingly being recognized for their ability to provide comprehensive fat assessment. This review outlines the principles, strengths, and limitations of key modalities, including dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), CT, MRI, and bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). DXA is cost-effective and accessible for population-level screening, whereas CT and MRI offer higher precision, particularly for visceral fat assessment. BIA is a practical, low-cost alternative, but it is limited by variability and lack of standardization. Regulatory agencies, including the US Food and Drug Administration and the Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety, are increasingly supporting imaging-based endpoints in clinical trials of anti-obesity drugs because these methods capture fat mass reduction beyond total weight loss. Recent phase III trials of semaglutide and tirzepatide have underscored the utility of DXA and CT in quantifying fat loss and preserving lean mass. Selecting appropriate imaging modalities based on technical capabilities and regulatory considerations can improve the evaluation of obesity treatments and strengthen the design of anti-obesity drug trials.",

    "abstract": "Military fluid replacement guidelines highlight the importance of hydration assessment prior to training and combat operations. Urine specific gravity (USG) is a commonly used assessment method to estimate hypohydration, typically based on a threshold of ≥1.020. However, recent evidence has suggested that this USG threshold may be influenced by body composition, primarily fat-free mass (FFM), thus a more liberal USG threshold (i.e., ≥1.025) may be warranted. The purpose of this exploratory study was to determine if there is a relationship between USG and FFM, a proxy for skeletal muscle, and compare FFM between those with and without elevated USG (≥1.020 and ≥1.025). A sample of 346 military personnel provided urine samples for analysis via refractometer and had FFM estimated via bioelectrical impedance analysis ( Regardless of USG threshold, male military personnel were proportionally more likely to be considered hypohydrated. There was a significant positive, albeit weak, correlation between USG and FFM ( These results suggest that USG is partially influenced by FFM and indicate that the liberal USG threshold for determining hypohydration may be the most appropriate for military personnel and other populations with higher FFM (e.g., strength and power-based athletes).",

    "abstract": "Ongoing evidence indicates increased risk of sarcopenic obesity among children and young people (CYP) with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), often beginning early in treatment, persisting into survivorship. This review evaluates current literature on body composition in CYP with ALL during and after treatment. This study adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelinesand was registered at the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) (CRD42023480732). Three databases (PubMed, MEDLINE (OVID), and CINAHL) were searched until March 2024. Studies with individuals aged 0-21 years with ALL during or after treatment were included. The Joanna Briggs Institute checklist was used to assess the bias risk. Of the 126 studies, 13 were included (eight cross-sectional and five prospective). Eight studies used dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, three used bioelectrical impedance analysis, two used air-displacement plethysmography, and one applied the four-compartment model. Fat mass (FM) increased early (T2-T3 ≈ +1standard deviation score [SDS]), and remained elevated at treatment end, and was above reference at follow-up (T5 ≈ +0.7 SDS). Fat-free mass (FFM) declined during therapy (lowest at T4 ≈ -0.7 SDS) with partial recovery by T5 (confidence interval crossing 0). Body mass index was elevated in the ALL groups versus controls. Heterogeneity was substantial, reflecting variation in age, assessment timing, and methodology. Despite methodological limitations, this review demonstrates persistent increases in FM and a reduction in FFM during and after treatment. Large, international studies using standardized body composition methodologies and clinically relevant cut-offs are needed to define long-term risks.",

    "abstract": "Appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM), a core parameter for sarcopenia diagnosis, is difficult to measure in primary care facilities lacking specialized equipment. This study was conducted to develop and validate an ASM prediction equation based on simple anthropometric and demographic indices. Cross-sectional study. The study included 5016 community-dwelling older adults (mean age, 71.0 ± 5.6 years; women, 55.9%). Anthropometric and demographic data were collected by uniformly trained medical staff. ASM was measured through bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). The participants were randomly divided (4:1) into a development group (n = 4013) and a validation group (n = 1003). Stepwise multivariate linear regression was performed to establish the ASM prediction equation. The equation for predicting ASM was as follows: ASM (kg) = 0.232 × height (cm) + 0.128 × weight (kg) + 0.128 × calf circumference (cm) - 2.039 × sex (men: 1, women: 2) - 0.021 × age (years) - 27.129. It exhibited an adjusted R Our equation appears to have high predictive power. With rapid and simple measurement of anthropometric and demographic indices, the equation can be used to evaluate ASM in primary care facilities lacking specialized equipment.",

    "abstract": "We aimed to assess the sex-specific associations of different measures of body size, composition, and fat distribution with data from an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and to compare their effect sizes in a population-based study. sCross-sectional data of 3628 (1898 women, 52 %) subjects aged between 20 and 84 years were taken from the Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP-Trend-0). We investigated associations of markers from body anthropometry, bioelectrical impedance analysis, and magnetic resonance imaging with markers from an OGTT including fasting glucose, fasting insulin, the homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance index, 2-h post-load (glucose and insulin) and glucose tolerance categories. For this, we used linear and multinomial logistic regression models stratified by sex and adjusted for confounding. All body composition markers were significantly associated with all OGTT parameters in both sexes. In women, visceral adipose tissue and liver fat content were most strongly associated with the OGTT parameters, while in men, the waist-to-height ratio showed the strongest association. Relative fat-free mass was the only marker, which was inversely associated with the OGTT parameters in both men and women. Overall, the associations of all body composition markers wee more pronounced in men than in women. Our study highlights that associations between body composition markers and OGTT parameters differ between men and women with a tendency of stronger associations in men than in women. Sex-specific body composition markers may have to be considered in clinical practice to predict future prediabetes and type 2 diabetes.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to explore whether changes in extracellular water distribution and phase angle can serve as early markers of muscle loss in patients with severe sarcopenia. A 12-month prospective study enrolled 128 severe sarcopenia patients (72 M, 56F; mean age 74.3 ± 6.8y), with regular multi-frequency bioelectrical impedance analysis (5-500 kHz) and phase angle measurement at 50 kHz. Body composition, physical function, and inflammation markers were periodically assessed. Of the 128 enrolled participants, 112 (87.5%) completed the study. Muscle mass decreased significantly over 12 months, with the most rapid loss occurring between months 3-6. Phase angle also declined consistently, and a drop of ≥ 0.3° over three months effectively predicted accelerated muscle loss. Changes in bioimpedance parameters appeared nearly three weeks before detectable muscle loss. The extracellular water-to-total body water ratio rose progressively and correlated strongly with muscle mass reduction. Limb regions showed more notable deterioration than the trunk. Multi-frequency bioelectrical impedance analysis combined with phase angle measurement offers a non-invasive and sensitive approach for early detection of muscle mass loss in severe sarcopenia. Shifts in electrical parameters and water distribution precede measurable muscle decline, highlighting a potential window for timely intervention.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the effect of leucine-rich high protein supplementation on body composition, muscle function and gene expression among older adults with or at risk of sarcopenia residing in Klang Valley, Malaysia. A total of 47 participants were recruited into this 12-week double-blinded, randomized controlled trial. Intervention group consumed 2 sachets of high protein supplement daily contributing to 50.6 g of protein/day and 6 g of leucine/day. Control group received placebo supplement. Body composition was assessed via anthropometry measurements, bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of left mid-thigh. Meanwhile, muscle function was assessed using short physical performance battery (SPPB). A total of 16 ml of full blood was collected pre- and post- study to assess participants' health profiling and changes in gene expression as determined by mitochondrial RNA activity derived from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The measurements were performed at 0, 6, and 12 weeks. Participants were mostly women (89.4%) with a mean age of 69.3 ± 7.1 years. Repeated measures ANOVA showed no significant intervention effect in body composition (anthropometry measurements and BIA) as well as muscle function (SPPB score). However, genes responsible for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production (GBA, MLYCD), cell proliferation (STAT5A) and DNA repair (BRCC3) were significantly up-regulated in intervention group (p < 0.05). Leucine-rich high protein supplementation did not produce significant changes in body composition or muscle function in older adults with sarcopenia. However, it showed potential in improving gene expression. Further studies with a longer supplementation period and a larger sample size might be needed for noticeable changes, particularly for body composition.",

    "abstract": "Malnutrition is common among individuals with intellectual disabilities, and behavioral resistance may limit access to routine oral care. This study examined the association between refusal of oral care and poor nutritional status. In this cross-sectional study, conducted between February and March 2025, we assessed 55 adults with intellectual disabilities living in two designated residential support facilities for persons with disabilities in Fukuoka, Japan. Nutritional status was evaluated using the Mini Nutritional Assessment-Short Form. Oral care refusal was identified from staff records. Functional and body composition data were obtained using the Functional Independence Measure, Barthel Index, and bioelectrical impedance analysis. The at-risk/malnourished group had significantly lower BMI, fat mass, and functional scores, and a higher rate of oral care refusal (p = 0.007). Logistic regression showed that oral care refusal [OR = 9.23 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.10-77.33], lower fat mass [OR = 0.78 (0.66-0.92)] were independently associated with poor nutritional status (FIM-Eating [OR = 0.86 (0.53-1.39)], gender [OR = 0.44 (0.08-2.27)], age [OR = 0.96 (0.90-1.02)]). AUC was 0.90 (0.81-0.98). Oral care refusal may indicate increased risk of malnutrition among adults with intellectual disabilities. Larger, longitudinal studies are needed to confirm these findings.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is increasingly being diagnosed in young adults and is associated with long-term hepatic complications. Early detection remains challenging in asymptomatic individuals, highlighting the need for accurate and non-invasive risk assessment tools. We developed and validated a machine learning (ML)-based model to predict MASLD in adults aged 20-40 years. A total of 13,047 participants from the Gangnam Severance Hospital were included in the training set, and 1,335 participants from the Yongin Severance Hospital were included in the external validation set. MASLD was defined as hepatic steatosis on ultrasonography with at least one cardiometabolic risk factor. Three models were constructed using stepwise variable addition: Model 1 (age, sex), Model 2 (Model 1 + body mass index [BMI], mean blood pressure), and Model 3 (Model 2 + bioelectrical impedance analysis [BIA] metrics, including percentage of body fat [PBF] and skeletal muscle index [SMI]). Logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), and extreme gradient boosting (XGB) were also applied. In internal validation, Model 3 achieved the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC): 0.90 (LR), 0.91 (RF), and 0.91 (XGB), with accuracies up to 0.81. External validation confirmed a strong performance with AUROCs of 0.89 (LR), 0.88 (RF), and 0.88 (XGB). BMI and PBF were the strongest predictors, whereas a higher SMI was unexpectedly associated with greater MASLD risk. Our ML-based model using non-invasive parameters accurately predicted MASLD risk in young adults and may facilitate early screening in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Edema following liposuction can obscure surgical outcomes and increase the risk of complications, emphasizing the need for quantitative evaluation. This study aimed to evaluate the association between postoperative edema severity and changes in weight and body composition, as well as to assess fat reduction efficiency across different edema severity groups in patients undergoing local anesthetic minimally invasive liposuction (LAMS). This study analyzed multicenter cohort data collected in 2024 from 20 branches of the 365MC Hospital in South Korea, including 3832 patients who underwent LAMS. Postoperative edema severity was assessed using a standardized self-report questionnaire and patients were classified into three groups: no edema, mild, and moderate to severe edema. The primary outcome was postoperative changes in body weight and total body water (TBW), using bioelectrical impedance analysis. The Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn’s tests were used to compare changes across edema groups, while multivariable linear regression evaluated associations between aspirated fat volume and postoperative outcomes. Weight reduction efficiency (per 50 cc of aspirated fat) was also assessed. Subgroup analyses were conducted by seven anatomical regions: abdomen, arms, back, buttocks, calves, flanks, and thighs. Of the 3832 patients (3825 females [99.82%]), the majority were classified into the mild edema group (90.34%), followed by moderate to severe (5.61%) and no edema (4.04%). Aspirated fat volume was associated with reductions in body weight across all groups, although the strength of this association declined with increasing edema severity, from an adjusted β of -0.06 (95% CI, -0.07 to -0.05) kg/cc in the no edema group to − 0.05 (-0.09 to -0.01) kg/cc in the moderate to severe group. In contrast, TBW showed the weakest and non-significant association, suggesting that postoperative fluid retention may obscure the weight-reducing effect of aspirated fat. Regional analysis indicated that the buttocks showed the highest efficiency (-11.41 [95% CI, -26.76 to 3.93] kg/50 cc in the no edema group; -5.89 [-17.64 to 5.87] kg/50 cc in moderate to severe), while the thighs showed the lowest (-5.74 [-9.82 to -1.68] kg/50 cc and -2.02 [-3.85 to 0.19] kg/50 cc, respectively). This study investigates the potential association of edema severity on postoperative body composition changes and fat reduction efficiency following LAMS. These findings highlight the clinical impact of edema on surgical outcomes and the importance of tailored postoperative management to enhance recovery and patient satisfaction.

This includes increased fat mass and decreased muscle mass, which can lead to sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity (SO), conditions associated with impaired physical performance and reduced quality of life, among other adverse outcomes. This study investigated the prevalence of sarcopenia and SO in individuals who recovered from the first COVID-19 wave and their association with functional outcomes. Clinical characteristics, body composition (bioelectrical impedance analysis), functional status (handgrip strength [HGS], 6-min walk test [6MWT]), and lung function (spirometry) were collected. 37 individuals (89.2 % Caucasians, 64.9 % females, median age 48 years [IQR: 40; 60], 10.8 % > 65y) were assessed after a median of 189 days (IQR: 169; 201) post-COVID-19 infection. The combined prevalence of sarcopenia/SO was 40.5 %, was identified in 37.8 %, while a single case (2.7 %) of sarcopenia without obesity was found. The sarcopenia/SO group had lower 6MWT and phase angle, and higher prevalence of hypertension. Sarcopenia/SO was negatively associated with 6MWT performance (β: -115.35, 95 % CI: -161.57 to -69.12), COVID-19 symptoms, disease severity, and duration were not associated with sarcopenia/SO diagnosis. A high presence of sarcopenia/SO was identified and was negatively associated with health outcomes in individuals post-COVID-19. Thus, it is important to assess and address conditions associated with abnormal body composition after infectious diseases to better inform strategies for improving long-term outcomes.",

This study evaluated the accuracy of body composition techniques against a 4-compartment (4C) model in individuals with overweight or obesity. N = 75 participants were categorized as having overweight (n = 56, BMI 25-29.9 kg/m ADP demonstrated the smallest overall difference in body fat percentage (BF%; MD = 0.10% ± 1.70%, LoA [-3.23, 3.43], P = 0.620), but its accuracy reduced in individuals with obesity.

Overall, ADP demonstrated the best accuracy, while DXA had the greatest differences compared to the 4C model. This may have resulted from TBW being overestimated by BIA, which would inflate 4C-derived fat-free mass. Although all methods demonstrated strong agreement for group-level BF%, a substantial individual-level variability (up to 5% error) highlights the need for caution when interpreting results in clinical or personalized assessment contexts in individuals with excess body weight.",

    "title": "Post-COVID-19 Changes in Body Composition and Adiposity in Patients With Chronic Liver Disease: A Longitudinal Study From Japan.",
    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic markedly affected lifestyle behaviors and metabolic health worldwide. Patients with chronic liver disease (CLD) are particularly vulnerable to such disruptions; however, how these effects changed after daily life returned to normal remains unclear. This study examined changes in body composition, hepatic steatosis, and liver fibrosis during the with-COVID-19 and after-COVID-19 periods, with a focus on potential sex-specific differences. A total of 187 patients with CLD underwent FibroScan and bioelectrical impedance analysis at three time points: before COVID-19 (2019-2020), during the pandemic (2020-2021), and after the disease was reclassified as Category V in Japan (2023-2024). Changes in obesity, hepatic steatosis, and skeletal muscle mass, as well as their associations with liver stiffness, were evaluated using univariate and multivariate analyses. Obesity and hepatic steatosis worsened during the pandemic but improved in the after-COVID-19 period, particularly in men. Overall skeletal muscle mass remained stable, whereas lower-limb muscle mass increased in women. The skeletal muscle index-to-BMI ratio increased in both sexes, showing relative preservation of muscle mass. In univariate analyses, changes in liver stiffness (ΔLSM) were associated with muscle mass parameters only in women; however, these associations did not remain significant as independent predictors after multivariate adjustment. As lifestyles normalized after the pandemic, patients with CLD showed improvements in obesity and hepatic steatosis. Women demonstrated recovery of lower-limb muscle mass, suggesting greater susceptibility to pandemic-related lifestyle changes. Although muscle mass changes were not independently associated with liver stiffness in multivariate analyses, these findings should be interpreted cautiously; nonetheless, they suggest that sex-specific factors may warrant consideration when supporting comprehensive health management in patients with CLD.",

    "abstract": "Myelofibrosis (MF) is classified among the chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms and presents unique nutritional challenges. Inflammation can trigger metabolic changes that lead to malnutrition and, ultimately, cachexia. Splenomegaly, which may occupy much of the abdomen and compress the stomach, can cause early satiety and further contribute to malnutrition. We investigated associations between nutritional parameters, clinical features, and survival in individuals with MF. Forty-five individuals with MF (21 males, 24 females) were included and compared with a healthy control group of 351 individuals (157 males, 194 females). Body composition (bioelectrical impedance analysis), resting metabolic rate (RMR), and substrate oxidation (indirect calorimetry) were assessed. The mean follow-up was 31 ± 8 months, during which seven deaths occurred. MF was associated with malnutrition; patients exhibited lower bioelectrical phase angle values and higher RMR (32.4 ± 4.2 vs. 28.5 ± 3.6 kcal/kg-fat-free mass/24 h;  Nutritional factors may serve as important predictors of survival in individuals with MF and should be considered in future supportive interventions aimed at improving both survival and quality of life.",

This cross-sectional observational study assessed body composition via bioelectrical impedance (BIA), skin temperature (supraclavicular and abdominal) through IRT, and anthropometric variables such as neck (NC), waist (WC), and hip (HC) circumferences. Calculations included waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) and conicity index (CI). Statistical analyses were performed in SPSS 20.0, with normality checked by the Shapiro-Wilk and homogeneity by Levene tests. Groups (eutrophic, overweight, obese) were compared using Pearson's Chi-square for categorical variables, Kruskal-Wallis, and ANOVA tests for quantitative data. Correlations were analyzed using Spearman's method. The significance level was set at p ≤ 0.05. Of 160 participants, 116 children were analyzed (eutrophic: N = 58; overweight: N = 26; obese: N = 32). Significant differences were noted between the eutrophic and obese groups. Supraclavicular temperature negatively correlated with BIA variables (total body water, fat-free mass, body fat percentage). IRT demonstrated inverse correlations between BAT temperature and BMI, NC, WC, and HC, underscoring its potential in obesity risk analysis. IRT also offers quantitative assessments of BAT activity and may estimate body fat percentages, suggesting its relevance for monitoring adipose tissue function and metabolic effects of physical exercise.",

    "abstract": "Numerous methods are available for measuring body composition in infants, however, there is no consensus on which approach is preferred. The aim of this study was to identify one such method for a clinical and research setting. A systematic search was conducted on PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library to identify studies that investigated the accuracy of body composition methods in full-term infants up to 2 years of age. Thirty out of 6643 identified records were included. Several anthropometric equations were investigated with inconsistent results. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) showed more comparable results to those assessed by air displacement plethysmography (ADP), when applying new techniques. Few studies assessed the accuracy of quantitative magnetic resonance (QMR), isotope dilution, and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIR); nonetheless, they all performed well against reference methods. ADP showed agreement compared to deuterium dilution, 3-compartment-, and 4-compartment-models on group-level; however, there were discrepancies when compared to DXA. Anthropometry, DXA, BIA, and ultrasound showed varying results, highlighting the need for further research. QMR, isotope dilution, and NIR appeared promising, but evidence is limited due to few studies. ADP showed consistently small bias compared to multi-component models and isotope dilution. Accurate body composition assessment in infancy has the potential to improve prophylactic actions against obesity. There is relative consensus on the most accurate body composition assessment in pre-term infants in a research setting, however, this consensus has not been available for full-term infants until now. Measure of anthropometry performs with varying precision, suggesting very low feasibility of the method for body composition assessment. From a research perspective, air displacement plethysmography is an accurate method for measuring body composition in full-term infants. This systematic review identifies research gaps within the scientific field of infant body composition.",

    "abstract": "BMI does not distinguish fat from lean mass, reducing its usefulness in active young adults. This study assessed obesity phenotypes and their associations with lean mass and adipose tissue distribution. A total of 174 male university students (mean age 20.88 ± 0.86 years) underwent anthropometric measurements, including BMI, waist circumference (WC), and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), and body composition assessment using bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). Participants were classified into four phenotypes (MHNW, MHO, MUO, and NWO) based on BMI, body fat percentage (%BF), WC, and WHR. One-way ANOVA with Newman-Keuls post hoc tests was used to assess group differences. A multiple linear regression model was applied to determine the independent predictors of %BF. MHNW was the most prevalent phenotype (66.7%), followed by MHO (19.0%), MUO (8.0%), and NWO (6.9%). Significant differences were observed in body composition and fat distribution among phenotypes. BMI poorly reflected %BF. Multiple regression analysis identified WC and WHR as the strongest independent predictors of %BF, whereas BMI was not significant after adjustment. Higher lean body mass in MHNW and MHO was associated with more favorable fat distribution patterns. BMI alone is insufficient to assess metabolic risk in young, physically active adults. WC and WHR showed superior predictive value for body fatness and should complement BMI in metabolic risk evaluation. Including lean body mass and fat distribution measures improves the identification of individuals at risk of metabolic and cardiovascular disorders.",

    "abstract": "The phase angle (PhA), derived from bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), has gained attention as a non-invasive indicator of cellular health and body composition. However, its relationship with physical fitness development during adolescence remains underexplored. This study aimed to prospectively investigate the longitudinal associations between phase angle and changes in multiple physical fitness components in male adolescents, examining whether PhA serves as a biomarker for fitness development over time. We conducted a repeated-measures study involving 195 male adolescents aged 10-16 years from a school in Campinas, São Paulo, Brazil. Physical fitness and BIA-derived PhA were assessed at three time points across two academic years (2018-2019), yielding 449 observations. Fitness measures included cardiorespiratory fitness (20-m shuttle run), muscular endurance (sit-up), flexibility (sit-and-reach), muscular power (standing long jump, medicine ball throw), speed (20-m sprint), and agility (4-m shuttle run). Phase angle was calculated using single-frequency BIA. Multilevel Bayesian hierarchical models estimated associations between standardized fitness outcomes, age, PhA, and their interaction, incorporating varying intercepts and slopes to account for individual differences. Age showed positive associations with performance in the 20-m shuttle run ([Formula: see text], 68% CI = [0.19, 0.31]), sit-up ([Formula: see text], 68% CI = [0.25, 0.37]), standing long jump ([Formula: see text], 68% CI = [0.30, 0.41]), and medicine ball throw ([Formula: see text], 68% CI = [0.50, 0.64]), indicating improvements in aerobic capacity and muscular fitness. Negative associations were observed for the 20-m sprint ([Formula: see text], 68% CI = [-0.31, -0.22]) and 4-m shuttle run ([Formula: see text], 68% CI = [-0.35, -0.23]), reflecting enhanced speed and agility. Adjustment for body mass and individual variability confirmed these patterns, though the effect of age on medicine ball throw was reduced. Physical fitness improved with age during adolescence, and phase angle demonstrated consistent positive associations with multiple fitness domains over time. These findings suggest that PhA may serve as a practical, non-invasive biomarker for monitoring physical fitness development in adolescents. Given its ease of implementation and cost-effectiveness, PhA could be integrated into school-based health screenings and fitness assessment programs to identify adolescents at risk for poor fitness trajectories and to evaluate the effectiveness of physical activity interventions. Further research should examine these relationships in girls and across diverse populations to establish reference values and intervention thresholds.",

For fat mass, bias was 2.6 kg (LOA:-3.8-9.0 kg) in active disease and 1.5 kg (LOA:-5.0-8.1 kg) in controlled disease.

These changes are important to decide whether transgender should have separate categories of competition. MethodsWe conducted this prospective study, to assess the body composition using bioelectrical impedance analysis muscle strength and serum irisin levels at baseline and at 12 months following gender affirming hormone therapy in transgender individuals. The comparisons were done in both cis mode and trans mode. ResultsA total of 32 transfemales and 22 transmales were included in the study. Among transwomen, there was an increase in total subcutaneous fat (9.2%) and visceral fat (11.3 %) (P<0.001 in both cis and trans mode comparison) and a decrease in muscle mass (7.7%) (P=0.033 and P<0.001 in cis and trans mode, respectively) and muscle strength at all sites (P<0.001). Among transmen, there was a decrease in total subcutaneous fat (5.9%) (P<0.001 for both cis and trans mode comparison) and an increase in muscle mass (7.2 %) (P<0.001 for trans mode only) and muscle strength except shoulder abduction on right side (P<0.001). No significant changes were observed in irisin levels following hormonal therapy. Interpretation & conclusionsGender affirming hormonal therapy leads to body fat redistribution after twelve months of hormone therapy with significant alterations in muscle mass and strength among both transmen and transwomen. Irisin, an adipomyokine produced through muscle contraction, did not correlate with muscle mass or fat mass on follow up.",

    "abstract": "Young adulthood is a period in which long-term lifestyle patterns are established. Barriers such as time constraints, low motivation, and environmental limitations may reduce participation in physical activity and hinder healthy nutritional behaviours. This study examined the relationships among nutritional attitudes, barriers to physical activity, general motivation, and body composition in university students. A cross-sectional design was used with 600 students (M = 21.08 ± 1.85 Students showed moderately positive nutritional attitudes (M = 40.53) and perceived personal factors as the most prominent barriers (M = 30.19). Men scored higher in nutritional attitudes, whereas women reported higher barrier perceptions and higher general motivation levels. Nutritional attitudes were negatively associated with barriers (r = -.332), and general motivation showed a weaker but significant negative association (r = -.189). Nutritional attitudes predicted 11% of the variance in barriers (R² = 0.110), increasing to 12.5% when general motivation was included. Positive nutritional attitudes were associated with higher muscle mass (β = 0.270) and lower fat percentage (β = -0.156), while barrier perceptions showed the opposite pattern. The negative association between barriers and all motivation subscales (including amotivation) indicates that higher barriers correspond to lower overall motivational engagement rather than increased amotivation. Integrating behavioural scales with body composition measures shows that nutritional attitudes, general motivation, and perceived barriers jointly shape students' healthy lifestyle profiles. These findings can inform gender-sensitive, university-based health promotion programs designed to reduce barriers and strengthen students' overall motivational regulation.",

    "abstract": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and obesity increase the risk of infertility, preterm birth and birth of a hypertrophic neonate. Effective weight loss can improve this disorder. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of subcutaneous semaglutide in combination with metformin for the treatment of PCOS patients with obesity and prediabetes. We prospectively enrolled 20 consecutive PCOS patients with obesity and prediabetes, (mean age 32 years) with BMI 34.8 ± 4.3 kg/m2, on combination therapy with metformin 1000 mg daily and subcutaneous semaglutide 0.25-0.5 mg weekly. Patients were followed up for 6 months. All patients were clinically examined and human body composition (lean mass, fat) as well as weight were measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis InBody 370. There was a significant weight reduction after 5 months of therapy (98.4 ± 15.5 vs. 85.5 ± 16.6 kg, p < 0.05), and a reduction was observed in BMI (34.8 ± 4.3 vs. 30.2 ± 4.7 kg/m2, p < 0.05). Similarly, there was also a significant reduction of fat mass (41.3 ± 10.8 vs. 32.3 ± 10.3, p < 0.05), but no impact of therapy on lean mass (31.1 ± 4.5 vs. 29.1 ± 5.1 kg, p = 0.56). Within the follow-up period, a significant improvement in fertility was observed, with 60 % of the patients treated achieving pregnancy. All resulting pregnancies culminated in the delivery of eutrophic neonates. In this study, we demonstrated a significant efficacy of combined treatment with subcutaneous semaglutide and metformin in effective weight reduction and improving fertility in patients with obesity, prediabetes and PCOS.",

    "abstract": "Maintaining optimal body composition and sleep quality (SQ) is essential for preserving combat fitness in military personnel. However, whether body composition independently influences combat fitness components and whether SQ moderates the relationship between body composition and combat fitness remain unclear. Therefore, we examined these relationships to identify the main determinants of combat fitness. This study recruited 92 elite army personnel, including company-grade officers and noncommissioned officers, who achieved the \"Special Class\" standard on the officially authorized army physical fitness test. Body composition was assessed by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), and SQ was evaluated using the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI). Combat fitness was measured through 3 operationally relevant tasks: leg tuck (LT), 240-m shuttle run (SR), and combat performance test (CPT). Partial correlation was used to analyze the independent effects of body composition, although hierarchical regression examined the moderating role of SQ. Body fat percentage (BFP) showed significant correlations with LT (r = -0.58), SR (r = 0.51), and CPT (r = 0.44), whereas skeletal muscle mass (SMM) correlated with LT (r = 0.60), SR (r = -0.50), and CPT (r = -0.46). Moderation analysis revealed that lower SQ strengthened the negative effects of BFP on LT (R2 = 0.41) and SR (R2 = 0.39). In contrast, higher SQ enhanced the positive effect of SMM on CPT (R2 = 0.29). These findings suggest that SQ can function as a moderating factor that either amplifies or mitigates the effect of body composition on combat fitness. Enhancing body composition-by reducing BFP and increasing SMM-and SQ should be considered concurrently to improve military combat performance.",

    "title": "Preliminary evaluation of oxyntomodulin as a biomarker for metabolic risk stratification in adults with obesity.",
    "abstract": "Oxyntomodulin (OXM), secreted by enteroendocrine L-cells, regulates energy and glucose homeostasis and is a dual agonist of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucagon receptors (GCGRs), with anorexigenic, insulinotropic, and energy expenditure-enhancing effects. While synthetic analogues of OXM are under investigation as potential anti-obesity therapies, the physiological role and clinical significance of endogenous OXM in human obesity remain incompletely elucidated. This study aimed to evaluate fasting OXM levels and assess their association with anthropometric and biochemical parameters in individuals with varying degrees of excess weight. The cross-sectional study included overweight (O1, n = 88) and obese (O2, n = 134) individuals, as well as a healthy control group (CG, n = 39). Body composition was assessed using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). Biochemical and hormonal analyses encompassed glucose-insulin homeostasis and lipid profile, with a focus on fasting OXM concentration. Insulin resistance (IR) and β-cell function were evaluated using validated indices. Fasting OXM levels were significantly elevated in the O2 compared to both the O1 and CG (p < 0.0001). OXM positively correlated with several anthropometric parameters, including visceral adipose tissue (VAT) mass and volume in O2. Logistic regression showed that higher OXM was significantly associated with the risk of obesity. Additionally, an increase in the risk of IR and related metabolic complications was observed with an increase in OXM levels, mainly in advanced stages of weight gain. These findings provide preliminary evidence that OXM constitutes a potential biomarker of visceral adiposity and early metabolic dysregulation, serving as a measurable indicator of IR in obesity.",

    "abstract": "Chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, and high CRP are linked to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD); Very low energy ketogenic therapy (VLEKT) shows anti-inflammatory effects in obesity. The primary aim was to evaluate the effects of ketogenic phase of VLEKT on MASLD and the secondary aim was to identify the underlying mechanisms in women with obesity. This prospective outpatient study included 80 women with obesity (mean age 39.25 ± 4.89 years; BMI 37.27 ± 4.58 kg/m2) and MASLD (FLI ≥ 60) who followed ketogenic phase of VLEKT (< 800 kcal/day, with macronutrient composition comprising 13% carbohydrates, 43% proteins and 44% fats at the University Hospital Federico II of Naples. Assessments at baseline and after ketogenic phase of VLEKT included anthropometric measurements, body composition (via bioelectrical impedance analysis), biochemical analyses, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels and the Fatty Liver Index (FLI). After ketogenic phase, significant reductions were observed in BMI, waist circumference, fat mass, total and LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, gamma-glutamyl transferase (γGT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), fasting plasma glucose and Hs-CRP levels (p < 0.001, for all). Weight loss (%Δ weight) showed significant positive correlations with %Δ fat mass (p < 0.001), %Δ total cholesterol (p < 0.001), %Δ LDL cholesterol (p < 0.001), and %Δ γGT (p < 0.001), while %Δ HDL cholesterol showed a significant negative correlation (p < 0.001). Multiple regression analysis identified %Δ hs-CRP as the main predictor of MASLD improvement, explaining 65.9% of the variance (p < 0.001). MASLD improved post-ketogenic-phase of VLEKT in women with obesity, primarily via reduced chronic inflammation.",

    "abstract": "REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a prodromal manifestation of α-synucleinopathies, with most patients converting to Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), or multiple system atrophy (MSA) within 10-15 years. Practical, non-invasive biomarkers for predicting phenoconversion remain limited. To evaluate whether bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) parameters, specifically extracellular water-to-total body water ratio (ECW/TBW) and phase angle (PhA), are associated with phenoconversion risk and motor symptom severity in patients with RBD. We retrospectively analyzed 147 patients with polysomnography-confirmed RBD (2016-2024, Samsung Medical Center). Baseline BIA assessed body composition, including ECW/TBW and PhA. Motor symptoms were systematically evaluated at a 24 ± 3-month landmark visit using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). Phenoconversion to PD, DLB, or MSA was confirmed by two neurologists. Cox regression examined predictors of phenoconversion, and linear regression evaluated associations between BIA indices and UPDRS outcomes, adjusting for age, sex, and MoCA. During a mean follow-up of 4.46 ± 3.15 years, 31 patients (21.1 %) converted to an α-synucleinopathy. Converters showed higher ECW/TBW (38.9 ± 0.5 % vs. 38.6 ± 0.7 %, p = 0.007) and lower PhA (5.0 ± 0.6 vs. 5.3 ± 0.7, p = 0.037). Elevated ECW/TBW independently predicted phenoconversion (HR 6.56, 95 % CI 1.10-39.30, p = 0.039; cutoff 38.4 %, AUC = 0.69). At the landmark visit, higher ECW/TBW (B = 8.72, p = 0.034) and lower PhA (B = -9.97, p = 0.017) were independently associated with greater UPDRS-III motor burden. BIA-derived ECW/TBW and PhA provide complementary insights into prodromal neurodegeneration. ECW/TBW predicted phenoconversion risk, while both indices reflected motor severity. These non-invasive, scalable measures may be useful for risk stratification and disease staging in RBD, warranting prospective validation.",

    "abstract": "Early identification of cancer-related muscle loss is essential to enable timely interventions and mitigate adverse outcomes, including mortality. This scoping review aimed to identify routinely assessed clinical measures associated with low muscle mass or muscle loss to inform future global screening and assessment. Medline Complete, CINAHL Complete and Embase databases were screened from January 2000 to October 2024. Eligible studies investigated factors associated with cancer-related muscle loss, included adults undergoing or previously treated for cancer, and assessed or estimated muscle mass. The search identified 22,270 studies, of which 292 were included. Most involved patients with upper and/or lower gastrointestinal cancers (50 %), undergoing surgery (44 %) or chemotherapy (27 %). Two-thirds (65 %) assessed muscle mass using computed tomography (CT) at the third lumbar vertebra. Other methods included CT-defined muscle mass of single muscles (e.g., psoas) (15 %), bioelectrical impedance analysis or spectroscopy (12 %), dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) (7 %) or other (3 %). As the benchmark for muscle mass assessment in oncology, results focused on CT-defined muscle mass, with comparison to other methods. Twenty factors were identified. Thirteen showed a consistent association in unadjusted and/or adjusted analysis: age, body mass index (BMI), performance status, muscle strength, physical function, arm and leg circumference, body weight, body fat, weight loss, fatigue, energy or protein intake, and physical inactivity. This review identified 13 factors consistently associated with CT-defined muscle loss which may help identify patients with cancer who are at risk and require further assessment and timely referral for evidence-based nutrition and exercise interventions.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this observational, descriptive, and cross-sectional study was to analyze the relationship between phase angle (PhA), determined by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), and body composition parameters in healthy adult individuals. The study included 265 participants (122 women and 143 men) aged 18-77 years, examined at a nutritional outpatient clinic in Prague between April 2022 and December 2023. Segmental multi-frequency BIA was performed using the Tanita MC-780 MA analyzer with eight electrodes and frequencies of 5 kHz, 50 kHz, and 250 kHz. The mean PhA values were significantly higher in men than in women (6.29° vs. 5.57°; p < 0.001). A strong negative correlation between the extracellular water-to-total body water ratio (ECW/TBW) and PhA was observed in men (r = 0.78; p < 0.001), whereas in women, the correlation was moderate (r = -0.33; p < 0.001). Conversely, a strong positive correlation was observed between PhA and intracellular water (ICW) volume in women (r = 0.71; p < 0.001), while in men this association was weaker (r = 0.17; p < 0.05). The data indicate that PhA is significantly correlated with body fluid distribution and body composition. The key determinants differ by sex-fat mass, particularly visceral fat, plays a predominant role in men, while in women, muscle mass appears to be the dominant factor. PhA thus emerges as a valid, non-invasive marker of body composition, sensitive to changes in internal milieu, with potential clinical applications for assessing nutritional status and the patient's physiological condition.

Maximal inspiratory pressure (PImax), and maximal expiratory pressure (PEmax) were evaluated using a spirometer to demonstrate respiratory muscle strength. Upper muscle strength was evaluated by HGS. Skeletal muscle mass was measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis and expressed as a SMM and SMI. The relationships between respiratory muscle strength, HGS and conventional body composition indices were investigated using Pearson's correlation coefficients and multiple linear regression analysis adjusted by age, weekly instrumental practice, number of years of practice, smoking history, and leisure-time physical activity levels. in males, PImax and PEmax showed positive correlations with HGS (r = 0.426) and (r = 0.589), respectively (p < 0.05). PImax also correlated with SMM (r = 0.740, p < 0.05) and BMI (r = 0.580, p < 0.01). However, the female group had no significant correlations with these conventional muscle mass indices. PImax were related to HGS (β = 0.504, p = 0.024), BMI (β = 0.676, p = 0.007) and SMM (β = 0.831, p < 0,001) among males' group in multivariable analysis. PEmax was the only independent factor related to HGS (β = 0,676, p < 0,001). in conclusion, this study reveals the independent relationship between HGS and conventional body composition indices with respiratory muscle strength in instrumental musicians.",

    "abstract": "Nephrotic syndrome (NS) is a clinical condition that results from the renal loss of protein exceeding the body's compensatory abilities. Dysproteinemia in the acute phase of the disease inevitably affects the nutritional status of children. It is unclear whether the situation will fully normalize in remission. The aim of the study was to assess the serum concentrations of retinol binding protein 4 (RBP4) and prealbumin (PA), as well as the body composition parameters in children with NS in remission in comparison to healthy counterparts. Thirty nephrotic children at the age of 11.9 ± 4.6 years were enrolled and compared to healthy counterparts. RBP4 and PA serum concentrations together with selected basic biochemical parameters, were determined. Body composition parameters were determined based on the bioimpedance method using the Tanita MC-980MA device. In NS children the mean RBP4 concentration was 42.6 ± 11.6 mg/l, and mean PA concentration was 540.1 ± 442.1 µg/ml, and those values did not differ significantly from those in the control group (42.0 ± 10.9 mg/l and 372.8 ± 107.9 µg/ml, respectively). RBP4 concentration correlated positively with the age of the studied patients, while PA was not associated with age. Both studied markers did not show significant differences depending on the remission status - maintained with immunosuppressive therapy vs. without active treatment, as well as on the categorization according to the clinical course - steroid-sensitive NS vs. frequently relapsing or steroid-dependent NS. Based on bioimpedance measurements, the parameters characterizing body composition did not differ between NS group and controls. RBP4 and PA, which can be considered as selected biochemical markers of nutritional status, as well as body composition measures based on the bioimpedance, do not indicate differences between children with remission of idiopathic NS and their healthy peers. Successful induction and maintenance of NS remission restores the assessed aspects of nutritional status of these children.",

A descriptive-analytical study included 14 MS patients (7 women, 7 men; median age 46.9 ± 13.5 years) from Granada. Anthropometry and body composition were assessed using bioelectrical impedance analysis (TANITA). Dysphagia risk was evaluated using the Yale Swallow protocol, TWST, and TOMASS protocols, and basic taste perception was examined. Dietary intake was recorded over 3-day (24-hour recall) and food frequency questionnaire (FFQ); data were processed with Dietowin® software. A total of 66.7 % presented with overweight or obesity (median BMI 28.1 kg/m²). The prevalence of mixed dysphagia was 71.4 %, with no significant differences according to disease duration, except for mixed dysphagia (p = 0.018). Over 70 % of patients had insufficient intake of energy, fibre, and micronutrients (calcium, iron, potassium, magnesium).

    "title": "Insomnia and Its Impact on Psychomotor Reactivity, Autonomic Function, and Psychological Well-Being Among Medical Students: A Cross-Sectional Analytical Study.",
    "abstract": "Background Insomnia is a common sleep disorder associated with impaired cognitive function, psychological distress, and adverse health outcomes. Medical students, owing to their demanding academic schedules and lifestyle patterns, are particularly vulnerable to sleep disturbances. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and severity of insomnia among medical students and to explore its associations with cardiac autonomic status, psychomotor vigilance, psychological well-being, and body composition. Methods In this cross-sectional analytical study, a total of 118 second-, third-, and final-year MBBS students were recruited using stratified cluster random sampling. Insomnia severity was assessed using the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Psychological well-being was evaluated with the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Auditory and visual reaction times (RTs) were measured using the RTM-608 Response Analyzer. Short-term heart rate variability (HRV) was analyzed using a 5-minute ECG recording. Anthropometric measures and body composition were assessed using standardized protocols and bioelectrical impedance analysis. Data were analyzed using appropriate parametric and non-parametric tests. Results The prevalence of clinically significant insomnia (ISI ≥10) was 27.1% (95% CI: 19.9%-35.8%). According to ISI classification, 58.5% of participants had no insomnia, 37.3% had subthreshold insomnia, 3.4% had moderate clinical insomnia, and 0.8% had severe insomnia. Compared to participants without insomnia, those with subthreshold insomnia had significantly longer auditory (p < 0.001) and visual RTs (p = 0.002), and higher DASS-21 scores (p < 0.001), but no significant differences in HRV indices or body composition. Correlation analysis showed that ISI scores were positively associated with auditory RT (r = 0.456, p < 0.001), visual RT (r = 0.247, p = 0.007), and DASS-21 scores (r = 0.508, p < 0.001). Conclusions Insomnia was highly prevalent among medical students and was significantly associated with poorer psychomotor performance and greater psychological distress, though not with HRV or body composition. These findings suggest that the cognitive and psychological consequences of insomnia may manifest earlier than autonomic or metabolic alterations in young adults. Early screening and targeted interventions are warranted to promote sleep health in this vulnerable population.",

    "abstract": "People with long-term type 1 diabetes have reduced cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF). We aimed to assess the influence of body composition, energy substrate use, and blood glucose control on cardiopulmonary exercise test performance in subjects with uncomplicated, long-term type 1 diabetes. Observational, cross-sectional study. Subjects with and without type 1 diabetes, paired by sex and age, underwent treadmill cardiopulmonary exercise test, bioelectrical impedance analysis, indirect calorimetry at rest and during exercise. We used the t-pair test; multivariate linear regression models and mediation analysis were used to evaluate determinants of CRF. 54 cases and 54 controls (52% female) were evaluated. The age was 39 (28-46) years, duration of disease 21 ± 10 years. HbA1c 7.9 (7.3-8.7). The baseline physical activity, resting energy expenditure, respiratory quotient and body composition were similar between groups. VO2max was 32 ± 9.2 versus 39 ± 7.9 mL/kg/min (p < 0.01) for cases and controls. Maximum carbohydrate oxidation was 809 (614-1174) versus 1082 (863-1454) (p < 0.01), respectively. In women 73% and 25% of the effect of diabetes status on VO2max were mediated by carbohydrate oxidation and heart rate reserve, respectively. In men 78% and 57% of the effect of diabetes status on VO2max were mediated by carbohydrate oxidation and phase angle, respectively. Type 1 diabetes group had an altered CRF with lower carbohydrate oxidation. This suggests altered metabolic flexibility due to low substrate availability that could explain the earlier fatigue during intense exercise. There were different determinants of VO2max in persons with diabetes according to sex.",

    "abstract": "Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) is a cornerstone of functional assessment in congenital heart disease (CHD), yet there are additional important contributors to exercise limitation that are not directly measured by CPET. This narrative review highlights the complementary utility of spirometry, body composition analysis, and evaluation of handgrip strength in augmenting our understanding of functional capacity in CHD. Spirometry provides insights into restrictive lung disease patterns prevalent in post-surgical CHD populations; body composition analysis, especially lean mass assessment, can reveal sarcopenia not apparent using BMI alone; and handgrip strength serves as a validated surrogate for overall muscular function and frailty. We propose routine integration of all three testing techniques as complements to CPET protocols to enhance clinical assessment, guide rehabilitation, and support prognostication in pediatric CHD patients. This review advocates for broader adoption and standardization of these measures in clinical settings to improve risk stratification and long-term outcomes.",

To review evidence from the literature on the association between FI and body composition. Observational studies investigating the relationship between FI and body composition in individuals of any age group were eligible. The searches took place on July 7, 2024, in the MEDLINE, Web of Science, Embase, and LILACS databases, in addition to the grey literature accessed through Google Scholar. Two independent reviewers selected the studies based on eligibility criteria. Titles and abstracts were analyzed, and the selected studies were then read in full. The risk of bias was assessed using the tools recommended by the JBI. The systematic review and meta-analysis are reported according to the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. A descriptive summary of the data was conducted, and a meta-analysis was performed, using random effects models. A total of 19 studies were included in the systematic review and 4 in the meta-analysis. Most studies used a cross-sectional approach. Percentage of body fat (BF%) was the most commonly assessed indicator of body composition. In the meta-analysis, there was no association between FI and BF% in the overall analysis (pooled mean difference [MD] = 0.09; 95% CI, -0.05 to 0.22). In the subgroup analyses, there was an association when stratified by sex (MD = 0.43; 95% CI, 0.18-0.69), method of assessing BF% (MD = 0.43; 95% CI, 0.20-0.66), and degree of FI (MD = 0.42; 95% CI, 0.0-0.76).

    "abstract": "Accurate diagnosis of obesity relies on valid body composition assessment methods. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) is the clinical gold standard for assessing body composition. Still, it is costly, leading to the widespread use of bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) scales, which often yield values that differ from those obtained with DEXA. This study aimed to: (a) quantify the error between anthropometric variables measured by BIA and DEXA; (b) identify variables with the highest and lowest errors, including sex- and body mass index (BMI)- specific analyses; and (c) propose a percentile-based calibration and ordinary least squares (OLS) linear regression method to reduce measurement error. Sixty-one participants (33 men, 28 women; aged 24-63 years) underwent height, weight, BMI, and body composition assessments using BIA and DEXA. A mirrored dataset was created using both methods. A linear-percentile calibration and OLS approach was used to align empirical quantiles, adjusting BIA measurements to DEXA standards. After calibration, the variables showed the highest predictive accuracy, while the trunk and limb BFM variables performed the worst, with trunk FFM (fat-free mass) improving only by the OLS method. Calibration reduced errors in most BMI and sex groups, except for trunk FFM and leg FFM, for which calibration showed no benefit. BIA demonstrates systematic measurement errors compared to DEXA. However, calibration through percentile alignment led to notable improvements, with the regression models showing a significant improvement in agreement between methods within this sample. offering a practical strategy to enhance the accuracy of BIA-based assessments in clinical and research contexts.",

    "abstract": "Limited reports have highlighted the protective role of Healthy Nordic Food Index (HNFI) score against several chronic diseases like cancers and cardiovascular disorders. However, its beneficial role in obesity-related cardiometabolic risk factors is not well understood. In the current work, we examined the adherence to Nordic diet by estimating HNFI score and its association with metabolic syndrome and its components among Iranian population. In the current cross-sectional study, 339 individuals with obesity aged 20-50 years were recruited. Dietary intake was assessed by a validated food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Enzymatic methods were used to assess serum lipids and glycemic markers. Blood pressure was measured by sphygmomanometer and body composition with bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). No significant differences were found in age, sex distribution, waist circumference, body mass index categories, socioeconomic status score, fat mass percentage, fat-free mass, basal metabolic rate across quartiles or physical activity of HNFI (all P > 0.05). Also, higher energy, saturated fatty acids, sugar, fiber, β-carotene, yogurt, milk, and potatoes was shown in higher HNFI categories (P < 0.05). Higher adherence to Nordic diet was accompanied with lower systolic blood pressure (SBP, P < 0.001), total cholesterol (P,0.047) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentrations (P, 0.034) after adjusting for age, body mass index (BMI), physical activity level). In multinomial logistic regression analysis, HNFI showed no significant association with most obesity-related cardiometabolic risk factors. After adjustment for age and sex, participants in the third HNFI quartile had lower SBP, DBP, TC compared to participants in first HNFI quartile (P < 0.05). No significant associations were observed for FBS, TG, insulin, HOMA-IR, α-MSH, and AgRP (OR > 0.05). According to our results, higher adherence to Nordic diet was associated with favorable cardio-metabolic risk factors among apparently healthy adults with obesity. Further researches are warranted to better clarify these findings.",

    "abstract": "Osteoporosis, a disease characterized by decreased bone strength and increased risk of fracture, represents a significant health concern in older adults. Primary osteoporosis prevention requires increasing bone mass (BM) to its peak at a young age. The estrogen-like effect of equol has been reported to suppress bone loss in postmenopausal women. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between BM and the urinary equol concentration, body mass, skeletal muscle mass, exercise habits, and menstrual abnormalities in younger women. Of a total of 395 female university students recruited, the final analysis included 275 participants after excluding those taking hormonal agents, those who did not undergo an equol test, and those who did not respond to the questionnaire. The mean age of the 275 participants was 20.1 years (± 1.1). BM was measured in the right calcaneus using an ultrasonic bone densitometer. BM was assessed using the osteo-sonoassessment index of the right calcaneus. Body composition was measured via the bioelectrical impedance method, using a multifrequency body composition analyzer. Hormone use, menstrual cycle, current exercise habits, and daily soy intake were assessed using self-administered questionnaires. Urinary equol concentration was measured using a Soy-Check system. Multiple regression analysis, using the forced-entry method, was performed with BM as the objective variable; and age, body mass index, skeletal muscle mass index, soy intake, exercise habits, menstrual cycle, and urinary equol concentration as the explanatory variables. In our multiple regression analysis with osteo-sonoassessment index as the objective variable, the significantly associated factors were determined to be urinary equol concentration (β = 0.11,  Young women with higher urinary equol concentration, exercise habits, and skeletal muscle mass index had higher levels of BM. The acquisition of maximal BM at a young age is protective against osteoporosis; therefore, increased urinary equol concentration at a young age may be associated with better bone health and could potentially contribute to osteoporosis prevention.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is one of the most common nutritional and metabolic disorders worldwide, affecting all age groups. Multiple regression models can be used to predict bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) variables in various populations. These models incorporate a set of anthropometric and simple measures to improve the accuracy of predicting BIA variables. The goal was to develop and internally validate multiple regression models to predict BIA variables using simple clinical and anthropometric measurements in children aged 6-12 years. This study employs an observational cross-sectional design. Body mass, height, body composition through BIA, anthropometric circumferences, and skinfolds were evaluated. Anthropometric indices were calculated. Statistical analyses were performed using R software. Non-parametric statistical tests were applied after a normality test. Pearson's correlation coefficients were calculated to assess linear associations between each pair of variables. The multiple regression models were adjusted using a stepwise method with the Akaike information criterion. The significance level was p ≤ 0.05. This study evaluated 128 children subdivided into eutrophic (N = 64) matched for sex and age with overweight (N = 30) and obese (N = 34) groups matched by sex and age. Significant correlations were observed between BIA variables and simple clinical and anthropometric measurements. Variables with the highest correlations with simple clinical and anthropometric measurements were body fat percentage, skeletal muscle mass, total body water, and fat-free mass, respectively. Multiple regression analysis indicated that simple clinical and anthropometric measurements could be used to estimate BIA variables in children.",

    "abstract": "Body composition is a critical health measure. Accurate monitoring of body composition, such as body fat percentage (BF%) and skeletal muscle mass percentage (SM%), enables individuals to make informed decisions regarding nutrition, exercise, health status and management. Recent advancements have integrated bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) into wearable technology, presenting accessible options for tracking body composition measures. However, the validity of wearable BIA devices in comparison to criterion methods remains underexplored. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the validity of a wrist-worn consumer device and a clinical BIA device against the criterion measure of dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). This study included 108 physically active participants (56 females, 52 males). Participants underwent assessments using DXA, a wearable smartwatch BIA device (wearable-BIA; Samsung Galaxy Watch5), and a clinical standing hand-to-foot BIA analyzer (clinical-BIA; InBody 770). Measures of interest included BF% and SM%. Data were analyzed for accuracy using tests of error [mean absolute error [MAE], mean absolute percentage error [MAPE]], linearity (Pearson's  When assessing BF%, both the wearable-BIA ( Both the wearable- and clinical-BIA device revealed mixed validity, demonstrating strong correlations for both BF% and SM%, and high levels of agreement and low error for BF%. Additionally, the wearable-BIA demonstrated acceptable accuracy for estimating BF% in females. However, wider limits of agreement and variability suggest limitations in validity, particularly for skeletal muscle mass and in individuals with higher body fat percentages. These findings support the practical use of wearable devices for general body composition monitoring when laboratory-based methods are unavailable, though caution is warranted. Continued development and validation efforts are recommended to enhance accuracy and consistency across diverse populations and measures.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate frailty status and its association with heart rate variability (HRV), body composition, and metabolic profile in patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). In this cross-sectional study, 139 T2DM patients (age 50-65 years) were recruited. Frailty status was classified as non-frail, pre-frail, or frail using the Physical Frailty Phenotype (PFP) criteria. Outcome measures included HRV from a 5-minute ECG, body composition via bioelectrical impedance analysis, and a full metabolic profile. The prevalence of pre-frailty or frailty was 95%. Increasing frailty status was significantly associated with autonomic dysfunction, characterized by reduced parasympathetic and increased sympathetic HRV indices (e.g., higher LF:HF ratio, p=0.003). Frail patients had a significantly higher fat percentage (p=0.015) and lower lean percentage (p=0.015) compared to non-frail participants. Poorer glycemic control (HbA1c: p=0.003) and a more adverse lipid profile were also significantly associated with worsening frailty. Frailty is highly prevalent in this T2DM cohort and is associated with significant adverse changes in autonomic function, body composition, and cardiometabolic health, highlighting the need for a multifaceted management approach.",

    "abstract": "Physical activity is essential for maintaining a healthy lifestyle; however, various psychological and physiological barriers can hinder participation. University students represent a high-risk group due to academic workload and social pressures. This study aimed to investigate barriers to physical activity participation among university students in the context of fatigue, motivation, and body composition determinants. The study employed a cross-sectional and observational design, and a total of 552 individuals with a mean age of 20.5 ± 2.1 years were included in the analysis. Data were collected through a demographic information form, the Barriers to Physical Activity Scale, the Chalder Fatigue Scale, and the University Student Motivation Scale. Body composition was assessed using a bioelectrical impedance analysis device. In addition to descriptive statistics, Pearson's correlation analysis was used to examine relationships between variables, and multiple linear regression was applied to determine the effects of predictor variables. Higher levels of fatigue were associated with increased perceptions of both personal (r ≈ .28) and social barriers (r ≈ .21), indicating that fatigue is a significant psychological constraint on physical activity participation. While intrinsic motivation demonstrated a protective effect (β=-0.22), extrinsic motivation (β = 0.19) and amotivation (β = 0.27) were linked to heightened perceptions of barriers. Furthermore, higher body fat percentage emerged as the strongest physiological predictor (β = 0.29), underscoring the critical role of body composition in shaping behavioural barriers. In conclusion, barriers to physical activity among university students are influenced by both psychosocial dynamics and body composition characteristics. Strategies aimed at enhancing intrinsic motivation, while reducing fatigue and body fat, may substantially contribute to overcoming barriers in this age group.",

    "abstract": "Sarcopenia is known to worsen clinical outcomes in osteoarthritis, particularly in weight-bearing joints, yet its relationship with symptom burden in hand osteoarthritis has not been well established. This study explored the relationship between sarcopenia, hand pain, and functional status in patients with hand osteoarthritis. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 1139 patients aged ≥40 years with radiographically confirmed hand osteoarthritis. Sarcopenia was defined as the ratio of muscle mass to body mass index, measured via bioelectrical impedance analysis. Hand pain and function were assessed using the Australian/Canadian Osteoarthritis Hand Index, and the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaires. Sex-specific multivariable linear regression models were constructed, adjusting for demographic and lifestyle covariates. In males, lower appendicular skeletal muscle mass/body mass index was significantly associated with higher DASH scores (estimate: -10.664, P = .006). A significant association with higher Australian/Canadian Osteoarthritis Hand Index scores was also observed (estimate: -26.236, P = .030). Lower upper-extremity muscle mass/body mass index was likewise associated with higher DASH scores in males (estimate: -41.074, P = .013). In females, none of the associations reached statistical significance. These findings suggest that sarcopenia contributes to increased pain and disability in hand osteoarthritis, highlighting the clinical importance of preserving muscle mass in its management.

The Prognostic Nutritional Index is a preoperative nutritional assessment, and its association with postoperative complications and sarcopenia have been previously reported. A reduction in skeletal muscle mass is essential for diagnosing sarcopenia, there are no available biomarkers that evaluate this. Thus, we focused on titin, a giant elastic protein present in skeletal muscle. This study was conducted as a prospective observational cohort study. A total of 105 patients who underwent colorectal cancer surgery in our department were included in the study. The patients were divided into two groups: those with and those without postoperative complications of Clavien-Dindo classification II or higher, and those with Prognostic Nutritional Index of 40 or higher or lower. Using blood samples, nutritional markers, inflammatory markers, urinary titin, and psoas volume, univariate and multivariate analyses were performed between the two groups to examine risk factors. Postoperative complication group comprised 12 patients, and comparisons between the two groups revealed a trend toward higher urinary titin in the group with complications with significant differences in univariate and multivariate analysis. The group with Prognostic Nutritional Index of <40 comprised 15 patients, and both analysis showed a trend toward higher urinary titin in the Prognostic Nutritional Index of <40 group with significant differences. Urinary titin may serve as a potential marker associated with postoperative complications.",

    "title": "What nutritional interventions can effectively treat sarcopenia in older adults with cancer? A systematic review.",
    "abstract": "Cancer primarily affects older adults, with a significant proportion also experiencing sarcopenia which is associated with poor clinical outcomes. In older adults with cancer, sarcopenia is not only age-related but also exacerbated by disease processes, inflammation, and the catabolic effects of treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Its presence is linked to increased treatment toxicity, longer hospitalisations, reduced physical function, and poorer survival rates. However, diagnosing sarcopenia remains challenging due to inconsistent criteria and limited access to diagnostic tools. Emerging evidence suggests that nutritional interventions may help prevent or reverse sarcopenia. This review aims to evaluate the effectiveness of nutritional interventions in managing sarcopenia in older adults with cancer. A systematic review was conducted using the PICO framework, targeting studies involving patients aged 65 and older with cancer and confirmed or likely sarcopenia. A total of 1439 studies were retrieved from databases and screened using Rayyan. Data extraction focused on outcomes related to body composition, physical performance, and nutritional intake. Risk of bias was assessed using RoB2, ROBINS-I, and ROBINS-E tools. Due to heterogeneity in study designs and outcome measures, a narrative synthesis was performed using SWiM guidelines. Studies were grouped by design and intervention type, and the GRADE approach was applied to assess evidence certainty. Nine studies (2016-2024) met the inclusion criteria. Interventions included dietary supplements, nutritional counselling, enteral feeding, and multimodal strategies. Most studies showed improvements in sarcopenia-related outcomes. Protein supplementation notably improved lean body mass and skeletal muscle index in some randomised control trials (RCTs). Observational studies found associations between certain dietary patterns-such as high fish and fat intake-and reduced sarcopenia risk. Nutritional interventions show promise in managing sarcopenia among older adults with cancer. However, further large-scale, standardised research is needed. Meanwhile, promoting good nutrition and physical activity remains essential.",

    "abstract": "Although patients with early-onset colorectal cancer (EOCRC) share characteristics with the general colorectal cancer population, they also exhibit distinct features. Parameters such as sarcopenia, myosteatosis, and overall body composition play a crucial role in disease progression. This study aimed to assess the impact of body composition on oncological prognosis. Patients were recruited from the Humanitas Research Hospital (Milan, Italy) and the Spanish Early-Onset Colorectal Cancer Consortium (SECOC) prospective multicenter study. Preoperative computed tomography scans were analyzed between January 2019 and December 2023. Skeletal muscle mass index, visceral adipose tissue cross-sectional area, and intermuscular and intramuscular adipose tissues at the level of the transverse processes of the third lumbar vertebra (L3) were measured. Sarcopenia, obesity, and myosteatosis were defined according to sex-specific and body mass index cutoff points. After analyzing 197 patients, the mean age at diagnosis was 42.16 ± 6.1 years. According to the colorectal tumor characteristics, 64% of the tumors were located in the colon (n = 126). After analysis of radiological body characteristics, the prevalence of sarcopenia was 61.9% and myosteatosis was 40.1%. Overall and disease-free survival analysis identified, among other factors, psoas muscle index [hazard ratio (HR) 0.67, 95% CI 0.53-0.85], sarcopenia (HR 2.09, 95% CI 1.06-4.14), and myosteatosis (HR 2.29, 95% CI 1.25-4.19) as independent factors implicated in oncological prognosis. EOCRC patients showed a high prevalence of sarcopenia and myosteatosis, similar to that described in elderly cohorts. This deficiency in muscle quality and quantity was a risk factor for recurrence and mortality during the follow-up of their neoplasia.",

This study aimed to evaluate whether the psoas muscle area and psoas muscle index (PMI), derived from the preoperative computed tomography imaging, could predict postoperative complications and long-term oncological outcomes in patients undergoing radical cystectomy (RC) for bladder cancer. We retrospectively analyzed 197 patients who underwent RC between 2014 and 2024. Sarcopenia was defined using sex-specific PMI thresholds based on the lowest quartile for the study population (<7.11 cm Sarcopenia was present in 24% of the patients. While the 90-day urinary tract infection and readmissions appeared more frequent in sarcopenic women on the univariate analysis, only the readmission rate remained significant after adjustment. Among the men, although the association between sarcopenia and 30-day complications did not reach statistical significance (odds ratio: 2.10, P = 0.075), the effect size suggested a potential trend toward increased risk. Sarcopenia was not an independent predictor of other 30- or 90-day complications, nor of OS, RFS, or DSM. The median follow-up was 30 months (range: 0-129). In this cohort, PMI-based sarcopenia did not independently predict perioperative complications or long-term oncologic outcomes after RC. These findings suggest that PMI alone may not be a robust indicator of surgical risk or oncologic prognosis in bladder cancer.",

    "abstract": "Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in older adults, with risk stratification relying on clinical scoring systems that often overlook sarcopenia - a critical prognostic factor in geriatric populations. The pectoralis muscle index (PMI), derived from chest CT, has emerged as an objective marker of muscle mass but its integration with established prognostic tools remains underexplored. This study evaluated whether incorporating PMI enhances the predictive performance of systolic blood pressure, oxygenation, age, and respiratory rate (SOAR), systemic immune-inflammation index (SII), and prognostic nutritional index (PNI) scores for 30-day mortality in elderly CAP patients. In this retrospective single-center study, 389 hospitalized CAP patients (≥65 years) with admission CT scans were analyzed. PMI was calculated at the T4 vertebral level. Predictive performance was assessed via Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis comparing standalone scores (SOAR, SII, PNI) versus PMI-integrated models. The 30-day mortality rate was 21.1%. PMI alone showed strong discrimination (AUC = 0.84), comparable to SOAR (AUC = 0.86). The PMI + SOAR combination achieved superior predictive accuracy (AUC = 0.92, P < .001 vs SOAR alone), with sex-specific PMI cutoffs of 7.88 cm²/m² (women) and 8.39 cm²/m² (men). PMI also improved PNI (AUC = 0.88 vs 0.76) but had limited synergy with SII. PMI is an independent predictor of 30-day mortality in geriatric CAP. Its integration with SOAR significantly enhances risk stratification, underscoring the clinical value of assessing muscle mass alongside conventional respiratory parameters.",

    "abstract": "Age-related muscle decline and obesity are associated with impaired bone health and substantially increased fragility and fracture risk; however, evidence in frail populations remains inconsistent. We investigated differences in bone microarchitecture across body composition phenotypes in frail older women. This cross-sectional study included 280 older women, of whom 109 met the Fried frailty criteria. Body composition was assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and categorized into four phenotypes: low appendicular lean mass (LALM; <20th percentile of residuals, -1.45), obesity (fat mass index >13 kg/m2), obesity with LALM, or neither condition. Bone microarchitecture was evaluated using high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT). Statistical analyses included generalized estimating equations (GEE) with Bonferroni correction, χ2 tests, and Fisher's exact tests. Compared with the obesity group, the LALM group exhibited smaller cortical area (Ct.Ar 71[23] vs. 90[18] mm2; age-adjusted p=.008) and thinner cortex (Ct.Th 0.858[0.202] vs. 1.031[0.217] mm; p=.043) at the tibia. Similar differences were observed at the radius (Ct.Ar 33[12] vs. 43[10] mm2; p=.002; Ct.Th 0.642[0.175] vs. 0.779[0.157] mm; p=.005). Additionally, compared with the obesity plus LALM group, the LALM group showed lower Ct.Ar, Ct.Th, total volumetric bone density (Tt.vBMD), and trabecular number (Tb.N), along with greater trabecular area (Tb.Ar) and trabecular separation (Tb.Sp) at the radius. Bone strength was significantly lower in the LALM group than in the obesity and obesity plus LALM groups. Among pre-frail and frail older women, obesity was associated with favorable cortical and trabecular bone microarchitecture than those with low muscle mass without obesity, suggesting that excess adiposity may partially mitigate skeletal deterioration. Longitudinal studies are warranted to clarify the impact of body composition on fracture risk in frail adults.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the postoperative course of pancreatoduodenectomy (PD) and distal pancreatectomy (DP) by examining body composition, physical function, physical activity and total intake to 1 month postoperatively, and to compare the two groups. This study is a retrospective observational study investigating. Forty-nine patients for whom preoperative and postoperative evaluation was possible were included. Measurements included operative time, intraoperative blood loss, body weight, body fat mass, skeletal muscle mass index (SMI), grip strength, lower limb muscle strength, walking speed, physical activity, oral intake, total intake, sarcopenia and complications. Body weight, body fat mass, SMI, grip strength, muscle strength of the lower limb, walking speed and sarcopenia were measured preoperatively and 1 month postoperatively. Weight, SMI, body fat mass and grip strength were significantly lower in both groups at 1 month postoperatively compared with preoperatively (p<0.05). The per cent change in body weight, SMI, body fat mass and grip strength between preoperative and 1 month postoperatively for each group was all significantly lower for PD compared with DP (p<0.05). Postoperative activity and oral intake were significantly lower in the PD group compared with the DP group (p<0.05). The incidence of sarcopenia increased significantly in PD at 1 month postoperatively (p<0.05). The present study suggests that PD is associated with lower postoperative body composition, physical function and activity than DP. Rehabilitation intervention that takes into account postoperative physical function, physical activity and nutritional status is required, especially for the PD group.",

    "abstract": "Low skeletal muscle is prevalent and associated with poorer outcomes after oesophagogastric (OG) cancer surgery. However, sarcopenia, including strength and function, is less commonly assessed. Therefore, we aimed to describe the prevalence of sarcopenia and changes in diagnostic criteria within 1 year of OG cancer surgery. This prospective observational study included OG cancer surgery patients from 2018 to 2021. Body composition was assessed using computed tomography (CT) and bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS). Low CT-defined skeletal muscle index (SMI) and myosteatosis were defined using published thresholds. Low fat-free mass index (FFMI) cut points were < 17 kg/m Forty-eight patients, predominantly male (63%) with a mean (SD) age of 64 (10.1) years, were included preoperatively, and 25 patients at 1 year. Low SMI (50%) and myosteatosis (50%) were prevalent preoperatively. Fewer patients had low FFMI (6%), low HGS (17%), and low walk speed (6%). The prevalence of Sarcopenia-CT was 15% preoperatively and 12% at 1-year (p = 0.32), and sarcopenia-BIS was 2% preoperatively and 3% at 1-year (p = 0.60). Despite a high prevalence of low SMI and myosteatosis, sarcopenia was less common. Low muscle mass, with adequate strength and function, is a prominent feature. Given the negative outcomes of low SMI, muscle assessment remains a valuable and clinically meaningful measure.",

    "abstract": "Reduced skeletal muscle mass at Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission is associated with increased mortality. Bedside techniques, including bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), ultrasonography (US), and calf circumference (CC), may help to estimate skeletal muscle mass in critically ill patients. This study aimed to investigate the accuracy of these bedside methods in assessing muscle mass compared to lumbar 3 (L3) CT-derived skeletal muscle index (CT-SMI) and determine cut-offs for reduced muscle mass upon ICU admission. A prospective, single-centre, cohort study conducted between May 2023 and April 2025. Patients (≥18 years) with an expected ICU stay ≥3 days were included. Bedside parameters (<48 h of ICU admission) included multifrequency BIA-derived skeletal muscle mass (BIA-SMM) and fat-free mass (BIA-FFM)), US-derived rectus femoris cross-sectional area (US-RFCSA) and quadriceps muscle layer thickness (US-QMLT), and CC (adjusted for BMI). These were compared to L3 CT-SMI and CT-derived skeletal muscle area (CT-SMA) retrieved 7 days before to 24 h after ICU admission. Correlations between CT and bedside methods were assessed. Reduced muscle mass was defined using CT-based SMI cut-offs (females <38 cm Fifty-six ICU patients (70 % male) were included, showing 64 % having reduced skeletal muscle mass. Correlations of CT-SMI with BIA and US parameters were weak to moderate (r = 0.36-0.45, all p < 0.05), while CT-SMA correlated moderately with BIA-FFM (r = 0.57) and BIA-SMM (r = 0.62, both p < 0.001) but not with US-RFCSA, US-QMLT, and CC (p > 0.05). Cut-offs for reduced skeletal muscle mass were BIA-FFMI: 23.8 kg/m At ICU admission, correlations between bedside methods and L3 CT-derived muscle mass were low to moderate. Cut-off values were derived to detect reduced skeletal muscle upon ICU admission. However, further validation is required before clinical implementation.",

    "title": "Agreement between bioelectrical impedance analysis and equation-derived estimates of appendicular skeletal muscle in acutely hospitalized multiethnic older patients.",
    "abstract": "Accurate assessment of appendicular skeletal muscle (ASM) is essential for diagnosing sarcopenia. While bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is widely used, equation-derived estimates may be useful when device-based methods are unavailable. We evaluated agreement between BIA-measured ASM and two equations: the COCONUT Study Group formula (NHANES-based) and the Japanese equation by Furushima et al. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of hospitalized, multiethnic older adults in Singapore (n = 295). ASM was measured using multi-frequency BIA S10. Equation-derived ASM was calculated using calf circumference, age, and sex (COCONUT) or age, anthropometry, and handgrip strength (HGS; Furushima). Agreement with BIA was assessed by Lin's concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) and Bland-Altman analysis. Diagnostic agreement for low appendicular skeletal muscle mass index (ASMI; AWGS 2019 cut-offs) was evaluated with Cohen's κ and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Analyses were stratified by sex and obesity. Furushima's equation showed stronger concordance with BIA than COCONUT (CCC 0.696 vs. 0.538) and smaller underestimate bias (1.56 vs. 3.03 kg). For low ASMI, Furushima achieved moderate agreement (κ = 0.48; AUC = 0.78) compared with poor agreement for COCONUT (κ = 0.17; AUC = 0.62). COCONUT performed poorly among women (CCC = 0.192; bias 4.40 kg), whereas Furushima improved performance but remained low overall (CCC = 0.371). Among obese patients, Furushima demonstrated the highest concordance (CCC = 0.862; bias 0.42 kg). Furushima's equation aligns better with BIA-measured ASM than COCONUT and may complement HGS in sarcopenia screening. Equation-based estimation could aid risk stratification when BIA is unavailable, though subgroup-specific biases require caution.",

    "abstract": "Sarcopenia is a progressive, age-related condition characterized by a decline in skeletal muscle mass, strength and performance. Diagnosis remains challenging because current consensus criteria are difficult to scale and existing biomarkers lack accuracy. This study aimed to develop high-performance plasma-based diagnostic models for sarcopenia by integrating proteomic and metabolomic profiles. Participants were selected from the West China Health and Aging Trend study. Sarcopenia was defined according to the 2019 Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia (AWGS) criteria. Two independent 1:1 age- and sex-matched cohorts were constructed: a discovery cohort (40 sarcopenic, 40 non-sarcopenic) and a validation cohort (30 sarcopenic, 30 non-sarcopenic). Fasting plasma samples were profiled using the Olink Explore 384 Inflammation Panel and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based untargeted metabolomics. Gaussian naïve Bayes classifiers were trained for single-omics models, and logistic regression was used to construct combined models in the discovery cohort and evaluate performance in the validation cohort. Baseline age and sex were similar in sarcopenic and non-sarcopenic groups (discovery: median 72.0 vs. 71.5 years, p = 0.714; validation: 71.0 vs. 71.5 years, p = 0.594; women: 52.5% and 53.3%). The sarcopenic group had lower skeletal muscle index, grip strength and gait speed (all p < 0.05). Sixty-five proteins and 268 metabolites differed between groups. A 7-protein Gaussian naïve Bayes model achieved AUCs of 0.743 (95% CI 0.718-0.767) in discovery and 0.698 (0.561-0.834) in validation; the metabolomic model yielded 0.828 (0.808-0.849) and 0.751 (0.617-0.885). Combined Model 1 integrated the probabilistic outputs of the proteomic (7 proteins) and metabolomic (7 metabolites) models and reached AUCs of 0.951 (0.937-0.965) and 0.823 (0.717-0.930), outperforming single-omics models (discovery: both p < 0.001; validation: vs. proteomic p < 0.05; vs. metabolomic p = 0.147). Combined Model 2 incorporated only the top two biomarkers from each platform (CCL13, FGF2, N-hexadecanoylpyrrolidine and 1-(cyclohexylmethyl)proline), achieving AUCs of 0.853 (0.828-0.878) in discovery and 0.911 (0.839-0.983) in validation and remained superior to single-omics models (discovery: both p < 0.001; validation: both p < 0.05). Its validation performance was comparable to Combined Model 1 (p = 0.124), with sensitivity 86.7%, specificity 80.0%, precision 81.2% and F1-score 0.839. We have developed high-performance plasma-based diagnostic models for sarcopenia by integrating inflammatory proteomic and metabolomic signatures. A four-biomarker model (Combined Model 2) demonstrated excellent diagnostic performance and may provide a promising clinically scalable approach for the early detection of sarcopenia.",

    "abstract": "The effectiveness of beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB) for sarcopenia in decompensated cirrhosis patients remains unclear. This pilot trial investigated the effect of HMB-containing oral nutritional supplement (ONS) on muscle mass as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included changes in muscle strength, quality, and physical performance. This randomized controlled trial included 21 patients with stable decompensated cirrhosis and sarcopenia (April 2022-January 2024). Participants received either an HMB-containing ONS (daily total of 1.48 g Calcium HMB, 21 g protein, 524 kcal) (HMB group, n = 12) or maltodextrin (control group, n = 9) for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was the 12-week change in muscle mass measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis. Secondary outcomes included handgrip strength, anthropometry, and physical performance. At 12 weeks, there were no significant between-group differences in muscle mass parameters (e.g., appendicular skeletal muscle mass index [ASMI], fat-free mass index [FFMI]) or handgrip strength. However, the HMB group demonstrated significant within-group improvements from baseline in phase angle (4.6°-5.0°, p = 0.015), mid-arm muscle circumference [MAMC] (23.3-24.4 cm, p = 0.008), and 5-time chair stand test performance (18.6-16.5 s, p = 0.047). The supplement was well-tolerated with no significant adverse events. In patients with stable decompensated cirrhosis and sarcopenia, 12-week HMB-containing ONS was well-tolerated. While it did not significantly increase muscle mass or handgrip strength compared to the control group, HMB-containing ONS showed promise for improving key sarcopenia-related parameters-phase angle, mid-arm muscle circumference, and chair stand test performance when compared to baseline. Larger adequately powered randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these findings. (Trial Registration: Thai Clinical Trials Registry on April 22, 2024, No. TCTR20240422012.

    "abstract": "Dyslipidaemia is among the major risk factors for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Paradoxically, higher cholesterol levels are associated with better survival in heart failure (HF) of any aetiology. Because cholesterol is an integral component of skeletal muscle structure, one possible explanation involves the interplay between lipid metabolism and skeletal muscle health. Using data from the Studies Investigating Comorbidities Aggravating Heart Failure, we investigated whether an association exists between low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and all-cause mortality in patients with chronic HF in the context of skeletal muscle mass. A total of 241 patients with chronic HF (68 ± 11 years, 80% male, left ventricular ejection fraction 39% ± 13%) were enrolled. LDL-C levels were divided into low and high based on the median value (93 mg/dL). The appendicular skeletal muscle mass index (ASMI) was assessed using a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scan and divided into high and low based on the sex-specific median value (men = 7.97 kg/m During a median follow-up of 6.3 years, 95 patients (39%) died. There were differences in mortality between the four groups, with the highest mortality in patients with low LDL-C levels and low ASMI and the lowest mortality in patients with high LDL-C levels and high ASMI (p = 0.002, by log-rank). The low LDL-C group had higher mortality compared with the high LDL-C group (46% vs. 33%, p = 0.01, by log-rank). Multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis confirmed the association between the low LDL-C group and higher mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.65 [1.00-2.72], p = 0.04). This prognostic impact of low LDL-C appeared greater in the low ASMI group than in the high ASMI group (56% vs. 37%, p = 0.01, and 36% vs. 28%, p = 0.28, by log-rank: p for interaction = 0.47). In the low ASMI group, lower LDL-C levels were predictors of mortality in multivariate Cox proportional hazard models (aHR 1.46-1.48 per 1 SD decrease in LDL-C, all p < 0.05). In patients with chronic HF, lower LDL-C levels were associated with higher mortality, especially in the low ASMI group. These findings suggest that low cholesterol levels may exacerbate skeletal muscle loss, potentially creating a vicious cycle that worsens patient outcomes. Lipid-modulating strategies could help mitigate muscle wasting in HF.",

    "abstract": "Resistance training is the cornerstone of sarcopenia management. However, whether combining it with amino acid-based supplementation, including essential amino acids, branched-chain amino acids, leucine, and derivatives such as HMB, provides additional benefits remains unclear. We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials until February 2025. Meta- and subgroup analyses were performed using a random-effects model. The Cochrane ROB2 tool and GRADE framework were used to assess the risk of bias and evidence certainty. We included nine randomized controlled trials involving 496 participants with sarcopenia. Evidence rated as low to very low certainty indicated that, compared with resistance training alone, combined amino acid supplementation and resistance training significantly improved handgrip strength (SMD = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.04 to 1.35), gait speed (SMD = 0.64, 95% CI: 0.02 to 1.25), Short Physical Performance Battery scores (SMD = 1.69, 95% CI: 0.81 to 2.57), and Five Times Sit-to-Stand Test performance (SMD = -1.42, 95% CI: -2.68 to -0.16). No significant effects were observed for skeletal muscle mass index or appendicular skeletal muscle mass. Subgroup analyses showed that baseline protein intake, intervention setting, amino acid supplement type, resistance-training frequency, and whether the supplement contained co-nutrients were significant effect modifiers. Resistance training combined with amino acid supplementation may improve muscle strength and physical function in older adults with sarcopenia, although effects on muscle mass remain limited. Responsiveness to the intervention may vary by baseline protein intake, training frequency, setting, type of amino acid supplementation, and whether the supplement includes co-nutrients, all of which should be considered when designing sarcopenia management strategies.",

    "abstract": "The exact mechanism of sarcopenic dysphagia following esophagectomy, which is associated with reduced pharyngeal contraction, remains unclear. This study measured the maximum pharyngeal constriction area normalized (MPCAn) as a potential indicator of post-esophagectomy sarcopenic dysphagia. Videofluoroscopic examination of swallowing study was conducted in 134 patients with suspected dysphagia following esophagectomy, defined as a score of ≥3 in the 8-point penetration-aspiration scale. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of MPCAn was applied to detect dysphagia in comparison with duration and distance of hyoid bone elevation and upper esophageal sphincter opening width. Cutoff MPCAn values were used to compare patient characteristics, including body composition and physical function. Multivariate analysis was employed to evaluate the association of MPCAn with postoperative pneumonia and recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis (RLNP). MPCAn was an important predictor of dysphagia, compared to the three videofluoroscopic examination of swallowing study parameters (0.874 vs. 0.784, P = 0.006). MPCAn was an independent risk factor for dysphagia at a cutoff value of 14. The patients with a larger MPCAn (N = 58) had significantly lower body mass index and worse timed Up and Go test results than those with a smaller MPCAn (N = 76) (19.76 vs. 21.56 kg/m2, P = 0.021 and 7.25 vs. 5.85 s; P = 0.014, respectively). MPCAn was significantly associated with late-onset pneumonia (odds ratio 2.58, 95% 1.03-6.46; P = 0.044) and was the only significant risk factor for dysphagia in those without RLNP (odds ratio 35.90, 95% confidence interval 6.20-205; P < 0.001). MPCAn was a useful predictor of post-esophagectomy sarcopenic dysphagia, especially in patients without RLNP, and was significantly associated with late-onset pneumonia.",

    "title": "Of the manuscript: relationship between serum Zonulin level and sarcopenia in Parkinson's disease.",
    "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate serum zonulin levels, an intestinal permeability marker, in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and explore its relationships with sarcopenia, motor subtypes, clinical features, and age- and sex-matched controls. This observational cross-sectional study evaluated 119 participants (64 with PD, 55 controls). Demographic data, along with disease duration, comorbidities, and motor subtypes, were documented. Handgrip strength and skeletal muscle mass index (SMMI) were used to assess sarcopenia, with SMMI determined by bioelectrical impedance analysis and adjusted for BMI using Turkish-specific cut-offs. Serum zonulin levels were assessed via ELISA. Compared to controls, zonulin levels were generally increased in PD patients; however, the difference was statistically insignificant (p = 0.289). Zonulin levels, though, varied notably across PD motor subtypes, with mixed-type showing the highest median levels (p = 0.004). The PD group had a significantly higher sarcopenia prevalence (73.4%) than the control group (53.7%), and longer disease duration was associated with sarcopenia (p = 0.014). There was no significant difference in zonulin levels between sarcopenic and non-sarcopenic individuals. Zonulin serum levels seem to differ based on PD motor subtype, which implies that gut permeability might influence phenotypic expression. The connection between sarcopenia, common in PD and related to disease duration, and its direct association with zonulin remains unclear. Future research should investigate gut-muscle-brain connections in longitudinal designs and evaluate whether interventions targeting intestinal permeability are associated with, rather than directly modifying, clinical outcomes in PD.",

    "abstract": "Sarcopenia is a progressive and systemic skeletal muscle disease. Uric acid is a powerful endogenous antioxidant and an indicator reflecting the nutritional status in the human body. Serum uric acid creatinine ratio (UCR) is serum uric acid (SUA) corrected by renal function. The relationship between SUA, UCR, and sarcopenia remains underexplored. This study explored the correlation between SUA, UCR, and sarcopenia in elderly patients. This study included 214 elderly patients (aged > 65 years) who were hospitalized in Xiangya Second Hospital from March 2022 to July 2023.  The levels of SUA and UCR were significantly lower in participants with sarcopenia. Spearman correlation analysis showed that SUA and UCR were positively correlated with handgrip strength and skeletal muscle mass index. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that, after adjusting for relevant confounding factors, UCR remained significantly associated with sarcopenia, while SUA didn't. The AUC of SUA combined with UCR in diagnosing sarcopenia in males was 0.744. In females, the progressive significance of SUA was not statistically significant. The AUC of UCR was 0.658. In the elderly, SUA and UCR are related to sarcopenia, but there are certain gender differences.",

    "abstract": "Sarcopenia, defined as age-related muscle loss, has significant implications on the physical performance and health of older adults. An adequate dietary protein intake plays a crucial role in maintaining muscle mass and function. In Japan, the \"Take 10!\" assessment method, focusing on 10 food groups with an emphasis on 5 protein-rich foods, has been used for older adults. This study aimed to explore the relationship between the protein-rich food intake frequency score (PFFS) and muscle mass, strength, muscle-specific strength, and physical performance in older Japanese women. This study included 309 Japanese women aged 65-92 years. The appendicular skeletal muscle mass and skeletal muscle index were assessed. Hand grip strength and knee extension strength were measured, and muscle-specific strength was calculated. Chair stand test, shuttle stamina walk test, 10-m walk test, and timed up-and-go test were conducted. The Take 10 food frequency score (Take10-FFS) and PFFS were obtained. A one-way analysis of covariance was conducted, adjusted for age, percent body fat, exercise habits, smoking habits, alcohol habits, preexisting conditions, polypharmacy, fall incidence within 1 year, subjective economic status, and years of education. Higher Take 10-FFS and PFFS were associated with better muscle mass, strength, and physical performance (P < 0.05), emphasizing the importance of protein intake in preventing sarcopenia. However, no direct association was found between PFFS and muscle-specific strength (P > 0.05). This underscores the complexity of the factors influencing muscle-specific strength.",

    "title": "Impact of osteosarcopenia in older people on prognosis following major surgery: a scoping review.",
    "abstract": "This review aims to map the existing literature on the prevalence, diagnostic criteria, and impact of osteosarcopenia on postoperative clinical outcomes in older adults. The search for this scoping review followed the PRISMA extension guidelines across five databases (Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, Scielo, and PEDro) from their inception until August 2025. Eligible studies included older adults with osteosarcopenia who underwent major surgeries and reported clinical outcomes. Additionally, data extraction covered three themes: study and population characteristics; prevalence and impact of osteosarcopenia on post-major surgery clinical outcomes; and diagnostic criteria for osteosarcopenia. A total of 164 studies were identified, of which 18 met the inclusion criteria, involving 3,235 participants aged between 60.7 and 83 years. The impact of osteosarcopenia varies depending on the type of procedure: (1) in oncological surgeries, the prevalence ranged from 12% to 44%, with reported complications including prolonged surgical time and reduced survival; (2) in orthopedic surgeries, prevalence ranged from 28% to 100%, with issues such as delayed recovery and increased mortality; and (3) in cardiovascular and gastrointestinal surgeries, the prevalence of osteosarcopenia ranged from 6.5% to 38.5%, associated with delayed wound healing and higher infection rates. Diagnostic approaches to osteosarcopenia showed substantial heterogeneity, most frequently relying on skeletal muscle mass index and bone mineral density, but applying different cutoff values. The prevalence of osteosarcopenia differs across populations and surgical contexts. This syndrome represents an important risk factor for adverse postoperative outcomes in older adults undergoing major surgery. Furthermore, considerable variability persists in the diagnostic criteria employed, underscoring the need for standardized definitions to improve clinical applicability and comparability across studies.",

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading global cause of morbidity and mortality. Beyond clinical risk factors and cardiac imaging, extracardiac imaging biomarkers provide complementary insight into cardiometabolic health. Routine noncardiac imaging often depicts the liver, kidneys, pancreas, lung, brain, adipose tissue, muscle, vasculature, breast, and bone, enabling opportunistic risk assessment. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), detectable on MRI, CT, and ultrasound, independently predicts major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Chronic kidney disease-related markers including kidney size, vascular calcification, and renal resistive index also correlate with adverse outcomes. Reduced pancreas volume is similarly associated with cardiovascular disease. CT-quantified emphysema and lung hyperinflation are associated with coronary artery disease and cardiovascular mortality. Cerebral small vessel disease markers, such as white matter hyperintensities and silent brain infarcts, demonstrate associations with cardiovascular events. Ectopic adiposity and sarcopenia quantified by CT, MRI, and ultrasound add prognostic value beyond body mass index. Extracardiac vascular and skeletal biomarkers, such as breast arterial calcification and low bone mineral density, further associate with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Collectively, these markers improve risk stratification and enable screening without added cost or radiation. Future priorities include standardization, external validation, and integration into risk prediction models to advance precision cardiovascular medicine.",

    "title": "Modified cardiometabolic index outperforms conventional indices in discriminating relative muscle loss: a cross-sectional analysis of NHANES 2011-2018.",
    "abstract": "Traditional adiposity indices like the cardiometabolic index (CMI) assess central adiposity and lipid metabolism but do not directly reflect insulin resistance (IR). The modified cardiometabolic index (MCMI), incorporating fasting plasma glucose, may better reflect IR-related metabolic dysfunction relevant to skeletal muscle health. Muscle mass is a basic and objective component of sarcopenia, and relative muscle loss has been used as a proxy indicator for the low muscle mass dimension of sarcopenia-related phenotypes in some studies. This study evaluates the cross-sectional relationship between MCMI and relative muscle loss, comparing its discrimination ability with other indices (BMI, CMI, LAP, TyG, TyG-WC). We conducted a cross-sectional analysis using data from 3559 U.S. participants aged 20-59 years, derived from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2011-2018 cycles. Relative muscle loss was defined by the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health (FNIH) as characterized by appendicular lean mass (ALM) adjusted by BMI (ALM/BMI) < 0.512 for women and < 0.789 for men. Weighted analyses assessed the relationship between MCMI and the odds of relative muscle loss. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated through multivariable logistic regression analysis. Bonferroni-adjusted P values for MCMI quartiles and tests for linear trend were calculated to account for multiple comparisons. We applied restricted cubic spline (RCS) models and threshold effect analyses to assess non-linear trends and detect possible cutoff values. In addition, subgroup analyses were carried out to examine potential effect modification by age, sex, and other important covariates. The discriminatory ability of MCMI was compared with BMI, CMI, LAP, TyG, and TyG-WC using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Key predictors of relative muscle loss were identified using LASSO regression with a 70/30 training-validation split and incorporated into an exploratory multivariable classification model for internal assessment. Model discrimination and calibration were examined using ROC curves, calibration plots, and decision curve analysis (DCA), and a nomogram was developed to visualize the odds of relative muscle loss. In survey-weighted analyses, higher MCMI was strongly associated with greater odds of relative muscle loss (per 1-unit increase: OR = 2.68, 95% CI 2.21-3.25); participants in the highest MCMI quartile had markedly higher odds than those in the lowest quartile (OR = 21.31, 95% CI 10.16-44.70), and all quartile-based associations and the overall trend remained statistically significant after Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Restricted cubic spline and threshold analyses suggested a non-linear association with an inflection point around MCMI 4.61: below this level, each 1-unit increase in MCMI was associated with substantially higher odds of relative muscle loss (OR = 3.52, 95% CI 2.78-4.45), whereas above the threshold the association appeared attenuated and statistically non‑significant (OR = 1.10, 95% CI 0.67-1.82). Associations were generally consistent across subgroups and appeared stronger in men (P for interaction = 0.002). In ROC analyses, MCMI showed the highest discrimination for prevalent relative muscle loss (AUC = 0.776) compared with BMI (0.727), CMI (0.690), LAP (0.708), TyG (0.661), and TyG-WC (0.718); a multivariable model that additionally included MCMI and selected sociodemographic and clinical covariates achieved an AUC of 0.828 in the training dataset, representing a modest improvement in statistical discrimination over MCMI alone, and the nomogram is provided as an exploratory communication tool for visualizing cross-sectional probability estimates derived from this model. In this cross-sectional NHANES 2011-2018 analysis, higher MCMI was associated with greater odds of relative muscle loss and showed better cross-sectional discrimination than with widely used metabolic indices (BMI, CMI, LAP, TyG, TyG-WC). Prospective studies are needed to assess temporality and clinical utility.",

However, researches on their effects on skeletal muscle function are scarce. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the efficacy of LR and SLR in promoting muscle hypertrophy and mitochondrial function in C2C12 mouse-derived myoblasts. LR and SLR were found to enhance myogenic differentiation as indicated by increased fusion index via myotube immunostaining and upregulation of MHC-Myogenin expression. These effects are caused by upregulated Akt phosphorylation, which is associated with protein synthesis pathways. In addition, LR and SLR supplementation led to increased mitochondrial biogenesis and enhanced mitochondrial function through upregulation of PGC-1α/SIRT1. These findings indicate that LR and SLR supplementation promotes muscle development and suggests potential for the prevention and treatment of sarcopenia.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to analyze the associations between walk ratio and the prevalence of osteoporosis and sarcopenia among older women in the community. A total of 225 community-dwelling older women participated in the study. All participants underwent standardized assessments of body composition, anthropometry, and gait parameters. Based on walk ratio, which was calculated based on step length and cadence, participants were categorized into the lowest tertile, middle tertile, and highest tertile, corresponding to the lowest, middle, and highest 33%, respectively. Osteoporosis and sarcopenia were classified based on femoral neck bone mineral density and the appendicular skeletal muscle mass index, respectively. Binary logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) for exposure to osteoporosis and sarcopenia across walk ratio levels. After adjusting for covariates, results showed that individuals in the lowest tertile had significantly higher odds of having osteoporosis (OR = 2.240, 95% CI = 1.031-4.866, p = .004) and sarcopenia (OR = 2.848, 95% CI = 1.271-6.383, p = .011) than those in the highest tertile (OR = 1, reference). Additionally, the odds of concurrent exposure to osteosarcopenia were significantly higher in the lowest tertile (OR = 5.902, 95% CI = 1.209-28.819, p = .028) compared to the highest tertile (OR = 1, reference). These findings suggest that a low walk ratio is an independent risk factor for both osteoporosis and sarcopenia, and may serve as a predictive indicator capable of simultaneously identifying osteosarcopenia.",

Although experimental studies have suggested potential muscle-related effects of glyphosate, its association with sarcopenia in population-based studies remains unclear. This study included 3177 participants from the 2013-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Weighted logistic regression and restricted cubic spline (RCS) analyses were used to assess the association of urinary glyphosate with appendicular skeletal muscle mass adjusted for body mass index (ASM/BMI) and sarcopenia. Subgroup analyses examined the stability of relationship between sarcopenia and glyphosate within different populations. Mediation analyses explored the potential roles of oxidative stress and inflammation biomarkers. Higher urinary glyphosate concentrations were associated with lower ASM/BMI, with a significant interaction by sex; negative associations were observed in males, while RCS analyses revealed nonlinear associations in both males and females. Urinary glyphosate was positively associated with sarcopenia, showing a nonlinear relationship, with stronger associations in males and non-hypertensive participants. Mediation analysis suggested that alkaline phosphatase (ALP) may partially mediate the association between glyphosate and sarcopenia. Our results suggest that urinary glyphosate concentration was associated with sarcopenia and reduced muscle mass, and that ALP may partially account for this observed association.",

This study aimed to compare the static postural stability, skeletal muscle mass index (SMI), and fear of falling between patients with and without sarcopenia. We hypothesized that compared with healthy older adults, patients with sarcopenia would have poor postural stability, lower SMI, and a higher fear of falling. A total of 40 participants (20 patients with sarcopenia and 20 healthy older adults) were enrolled in this study. Postural stability, SMI, and fear of falling were assessed using a pressure platform, bioimpedance analysis, and the Falls Efficacy Scale International (FES-I) scores, respectively. Compared with healthy older adults, patients with sarcopenia demonstrated lower single-leg static postural stability, lower SMI, and higher FES-I scores. Additionally, in the sarcopenia group, individuals with a high fear of falling (FES-I score > 26) showed significantly poorer single-leg static postural stability and lower SMI than those with a low fear of falling (FES-I score < 26). Pearson correlation analysis showed that the single-leg static postural stability index (overall and mediolateral stability) was negatively correlated with the SMI but not with FES-I scores. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating balance training and muscle-strengthening exercises into the management of patients with sarcopenia.",

    "abstract": "Considering sarcopenia's major health threat to older adults and the limited efficacy of current treatments, this study aims to unveil the rehabilitation effects of whole-body vibration training (WBVT) combined with blood flow restriction (BFR) training on older patients with sarcopenia. This study is a randomized controlled experiment. Seventy-four older patients with sarcopenia were randomly split into observation and control groups (37 each). Both groups received nutrition support; the control group underwent conventional rehabilitation, whereas the observation group underwent an additional 6-week WBVT and BFR training. Outcomes included skeletal muscle mass index (SMI), appendicular SMI (ASMI), grip strength, 6-min walk test (6MWT), self-care ability (Short Physical Performance Battery Score [SPPB]), and daily living ability (Activity of Daily Living Scale [ADL]). After the intervention, SMI and ASMI increased, with higher values in the observation group (P < 0.05); 6MWT and grip strength improved in both groups, with higher values in the observation group (P < 0.05); and SPPB and ADL scores increased in both groups, with higher scores in the observation group (P < 0.05). WBVT combined with BFR training effectively enhances muscle strength, improves motor function, and increases the quality of life in older patients with sarcopenia.",

    "abstract": "Sarcopenia, characterised by reduced skeletal muscle mass and strength, is increasingly recognised as a prognostic marker in oncology. Its role in breast cancer and its variation across molecular subtypes remains unclear. This study examined the prognostic value of sarcopenia, defined by Skeletal Muscle Index (SMI), and its association with overall survival (OS) among breast cancer subtypes. This retrospective study included 523 women diagnosed with breast cancer at Ege University between January 2014 and January 2015. Clinical, pathological and anthropometric data were collected. Sarcopenia was evaluated using bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) with the TANITA SC-330 device to estimate appendicular muscle mass, and defined as SMI <5.5 kg/m². Survival outcomes were analysed using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression models adjusted for age, tumour stage, molecular subtype and body mass index. Subgroup analyses were performed for luminal A, luminal B, HER2-positive and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtypes. The mean age was 57.6±13.0 years, and 9.7% were sarcopenic. Sarcopenia was significantly associated with reduced OS (HR: 1.789, p=0.025). While no significant effect was seen in luminal A or B subtypes, sarcopenia predicted markedly worse survival in HER2-positive patients (HR: 11.247, p=0.001) and TNBC patients. Recurrence rates were similar between sarcopenic and non-sarcopenic individuals. Sarcopenia assessed by BIA is an independent predictor of poor survival in breast cancer, particularly in HER2-positive and TNBC subtypes. Incorporating muscle assessment into routine evaluation may help identify high-risk patients and guide supportive care.",

Appendicular skeletal muscle mass index (ASMI), calf circumference, grip strength, and 6-m walking speed were measured. Patients were categorized into non-sarcopenia (n=78) and sarcopenia (n=36) groups. Conventional ultrasound and SWE features were measured in relaxed and passive stretched states, and the presence of flaky myosteatosis echo (FE) in rectus femoris (RF) was evaluated. The differences in clinical indicators, conventional ultrasound and SWE features between the two group were analyzed. The Spearman correlation analysis was used to assess the relationship between clinical indicators and conventional ultrasound/SWE features. Independent predictors of sarcopenia were subsequently, and a combined diagnostic model was established by binary logistic regression analysis based on these predictors. The sarcopenia group exhibited significantly lower subcutaneous adipose tissue thickness (T/SAT Conventional ultrasound combined with SWE provides a novel and quantitative approach for visualizing alterations in muscle mass and stiffness, facilitating early identification of sarcopenia in CVD patients and offering reliable imaging evidence for clinical intervention.",

    "abstract": "Sarcopenic obesity is characterized by excessive fat mass accompanied by sarcopenia, resulting in combined health risks associated with both conditions. Currently, no standardized or effective treatment approach has been established. The health risks and potential for physical disability associated with sarcopenia increase with age, and older women face greater challenges than men due to the accelerated muscle loss following menopause. Given the absence of standardized or effective treatments, this systematic review aimed to evaluate which non-pharmacological interventions can effectively improve body composition and physical function in older women (aged ≥60 years) with sarcopenic obesity. Systematic review and meta-analysis. Older women aged 60 years and above. A comprehensive search of four electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and the Cochrane Library) was conducted up to April 2025. A total of 11 studies were included in the meta-analysis, comprising 10 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and one quasi-experimental study. Although the latter did not employ random allocation, it was included due to the rigor of its intervention design, the completeness of its data, and its relevance to the research question. The primary outcomes measured included key indicators of body composition and physical function. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 (RoB 2) tool. To determine the certainty of evidence for the main outcomes, the GRADE approach was applied, evaluating five domains: risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias. A total of 11 studies (10 randomized controlled trials and 1 non-randomized controlled trial) involving 532 participants were included. Meta-analysis revealed that exercise and other non-pharmacological interventions significantly reduced body fat percentage (WMD = -1.85, 95% CI: -3.35 to -0.36,  Future studies on sarcopenic obesity should adopt the latest international consensus criteria (e.g., European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People 2, Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia 2019) to enhance the comparability and clinical applicability of findings. Current evidence indicates that exercise interventions, particularly resistance training, serve as the cornerstone for improving handgrip strength and functional outcomes such as gait speed. Various non-pharmacological approaches have also been validated in improving body composition indicators (Body Fat Percentage, Appendicular Free Fat Mass, and Skeletal Muscle Index). The synergistic effects of combined exercise and nutritional interventions on muscle mass and strength warrant further investigation, especially to determine the optimal modality and dosage in women with sarcopenic obesity. Future intervention strategies should be systematically designed to integrate short-term intensive programs with long-term maintenance, thereby maximizing therapeutic benefits and improving clinical feasibility.",

    "abstract": "Sarcopenia has emerged as one of the major complications in end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), leading to greater disability and poor long-term outcomes. This study aimed to compare quadriceps muscle sonoelastographic parameters between ESKD patients with and without sarcopenia. We prospectively enrolled 50 ESKD patients with sarcopenia and 50 ESKD patients without sarcopenia as controls. All participants underwent clinical and laboratory evaluation, sonoelastography of the quadriceps muscle, and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) for muscle mass assessment. Sarcopenia was diagnosed according to the revised European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP2, 2019), which emphasizes muscle strength as the principal determinant. Handgrip strength, gait speed, and appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM/height²) by DXA were assessed. The elastography ratio was calculated as the stiffness of the quadriceps muscle relative to the overlying subcutaneous tissue. Comparisons were made between the sarcopenia and non-sarcopenia groups. A total of 100 ESKD patients were included: 50 with sarcopenia (mean age, 63.0 ± 12.7 years) and 50 without sarcopenia (mean age, 58.3 ± 14.9 years). The sarcopenia group demonstrated a lower quadriceps-to-subcutaneous tissue elastography ratio compared with the control group. Multivariate logistic regression identified the quadriceps-to-subcutaneous tissue ratio, muscle hardness, and body mass index (BMI) as independent predictors of sarcopenia (p < 0.05). Lower BMI was associated with an increased risk of sarcopenia. The optimal quadriceps-to-subcutaneous tissue elastography ratio cut-off value was 0.885 (sensitivity 82.4%; specificity 66.7%). Sonoelastography provides a reliable and non-invasive assessment of quadriceps muscle stiffness and demonstrates good predictive value for detecting sarcopenia in ESKD patients. Given its accessibility, low cost, and ease of use, sonoelastography may serve as a valuable adjunct to conventional DXA in evaluating muscle quality in this high-risk population.",

    "title": "Longitudinal analysis of sleep duration trajectories and sarcopenia risk in middle-aged and older Chinese adults: evidence from China health and retirement longitudinal study.",
    "abstract": "Sarcopenia has emerged as a significant public health issue that threatens the health of older adults. The association between sleep duration and sarcopenia is receiving increasing attention. Based on data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), this study investigates the dynamic characteristics of sleep duration trajectories and their relationship with the onset of sarcopenia. A retrospective cohort study. The study used data from the CHARLS across various regions of China. Data were drawn from the 2011, 2013 and 2015 waves of CHARLS, including 2521 participants aged 45 years or older at baseline who had complete 3-year records of sarcopenia diagnosis. Sarcopenia was defined according to the 2019 criteria established by the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia and was assessed across three dimensions: grip strength, estimated appendicular skeletal muscle mass and physical function. Participants were categorised by changes in sleep duration, and linear mixed-effects models were used to identify three trajectories of sleep duration change (decrease-increase, decrease-no recovery and continuous increase). Multivariate logistic regression was conducted to examine the association between these trajectories and the risk of sarcopenia, adjusting for confounders, such as education level, body mass index (BMI) and lifestyle factors. The median age of the cohort was 57.00 years, 61.40% of participants were female and the median BMI was 23.44. During the 5-year follow-up, the prevalence of sarcopenia was 14.09%. Compared with the non-sarcopenia group, individuals with sarcopenia had a higher median age (60.00 vs 56.00 years, p<0.001), lower BMI (23.06 vs 23.44, p=0.020), a higher proportion of unmarried/divorced individuals (16.34% vs 11.5%, p=0.010) and lower education levels (p<0.001). After adjusting for gender, age, BMI, residential area, education level, marital status, health insurance status, smoking and alcohol consumption, both increased and decreased sleep durations were associated with higher odds of sarcopenia relative to unchanged sleep duration, though the associations were not statistically significant (increased sleep duration: OR=1.081, 95% CI 0.807 to 1.449, p=0.601 and decreased sleep duration: OR=1.225, 95% CI 0.928 to 1.618, p=0.153). These results remained non-significant after further multivariate adjustment. Analysis of the three sleep duration trajectories identified via the linear mixed-effects model showed that, after multivariate adjustment and in comparison with trajectory 1 (sleep duration decreased and then increased significantly, exceeding baseline levels), both trajectory 2 (sleep duration decreased and then slightly increased but remained below baseline) and trajectory 3 (a consistent increase in sleep duration) were associated with a potential reduction in sarcopenia risk. However, these associations were not statistically significant (trajectory 2: OR=0.833, 95% CI 0.620 to 1.120, p=0.226 and trajectory 3: OR=0.844, 95% CI 0.647 to 1.101, p=0.210). This study developed a novel sleep trajectory model using longitudinal data, revealing the non-linear, multidimensional nature of the relationship between sleep duration and sarcopenia risk. Although no independent association was identified between 5-year sleep duration trajectories and sarcopenia in Chinese middle-aged and older adults, the study provides a valuable methodological framework for exploring multifactorial interactions in the ageing process and establishes a foundation for future research.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the diagnostic performance of a consumer-grade bioelectrical impedance analyzer (OMRON HBF-514C) against dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) for detecting sarcopenia in women with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). In this cross‑sectional study, 103 women with T2DM underwent body composition assessment using the OMRON HBF‑514C BIA device and DXA. Sarcopenia was defined by fat‑free mass index (FFMI), skeletal muscle index (SMI), and established DXA‑based criteria. Analyses included Spearman correlation, Bland-Altman plots, Cohen's kappa, receiver operating characteristic curves, and regression‑based bias correction. FFMI-BIA strongly correlated with FFMI-DXA (r = 0.881) and with SMI (r = 0.854). ROC analyses yielded AUCs of 0.878 and 0.873 with optimized FFMI-BIA cut-offs, giving sensitivity/specificity of 87.8 %/79.3 % and 85.1 %/82.8 %, respectively. The bias-correction model explained 78.3 % of the variance in FFMI-DXA and reduced mean bias to -0.0009 kg/m The OMRON HBF‑514C shows strong correlation, accurate diagnostic performance with optimized cut‑offs, and minimal systematic bias after calibration. Its affordability, portability, and enhanced precision support its use for sarcopenia screening in resource‑limited settings when combined with functional assessments.",

As a full GA is time consuming and expensive, frailty screening methods are worth investigating. Sarcopenia and the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) could be easily available biomarkers related to frailty. We investigated the relationships between NLR, sarcopenia, and frailty, and assessed the potential of NLR as a frailty screening method in older patients with head and neck cancer (HNC). In addition, the relationship between the NLR and each GA item was investigated.

The GA to determine frailty was assessed as outcome. Sarcopenia was defined as the combination of low SMM and low HGS. The mean age was 70 (6.08 SD) years. A total of 95 (64 %) patients had an elevated NLR and 21 (14 %) had sarcopenia. Based on the GA, 56 (38 %) patients were determined as frail. Patients with an elevated NLR were more likely to be frail and sarcopenic compared to patients with a normal NLR. NLR score showed a significant though weak correlation with frailty ( Increased NLR is frequently observed in older HNC patients, often in combination with low SMI and frailty. There is a significant correlation between NLR and frailty. However, the accuracy of NLR to predict frailty based on GA is limited.",

Significant skeletal muscle loss following invasive cardiovascular surgery presents a considerable clinical challenge. This study aimed to investigate the association between preoperative visceral fat mass and postoperative skeletal muscle loss, emphasizing the clinical utility of computed tomography-based body composition analysis. This retrospective cohort study included Japanese patients who underwent elective cardiovascular surgery (May 2020 to December 2023). Preoperative computed tomography was used to calculate the visceral fat area, subcutaneous fat area, and psoas muscle area as indicators of skeletal muscle mass. Skeletal muscle loss was assessed by the change in the psoas muscle area between the preoperative period and the first postoperative week. Of the 159 patients included in the final analysis, 69.2% were classified as having visceral obesity. Preoperative visceral fat area was significantly correlated with peak postoperative C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (r = 0.361) and changes in psoas muscle area (r = -0.374), whereas subcutaneous fat area showed no such correlation. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, after adjusting for clinical characteristics, including age, body mass index, operative time, preoperative CRP level, EuroSCORE II, and preoperative 6-min walk distance, higher visceral fat area was significantly associated with postoperative skeletal muscle loss (odds ratio [OR]: 1.01; 95% CI: 1.00-1.02), whereas subcutaneous fat area was not (OR: 1.01; 95% CI: 0.99-1.02). Preoperative visceral fat area measured using computed tomography is a robust predictor of postoperative skeletal muscle loss. Visceral obesity, linked to heightened systemic inflammation, may accelerate muscle degradation through proinflammatory pathways.",

    "abstract": "Sarcopenia is associated with poor outcomes in patients with cirrhosis. While computed tomography (CT)-derived skeletal muscle index (SMI) is considered the gold standard for diagnosis in this setting, its use is limited due to cost, radiation exposure, and availability. Our aim was to evaluate whether simple, non-radiating, easy-to-use methods, including ultrasound (US), bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), and anthropometry, could accurately identify sarcopenia in this population. A total of 250 patients with cirrhosis who underwent an abdominal CT scan were enrolled prospectively in this single-center, cross-sectional study. Within 1 month, the patients underwent assessments including anthropometry, handgrip strength, BIA [including body protein index (BPI)], and US of the psoas and thigh. Sarcopenia was defined by CT-based SMI at L3 (<50 cm 2 /m 2 in men, <39 cm 2 /m 2 in women). Thigh and psoas muscle thickness (normalized by height 2 ) and BPI showed moderate to strong correlations with SMI (ρ = 0.42-0.71). Multivariable models combining thigh or psoas US with BMI and calf circumference achieved AUROCs of 0.837 and 0.822, respectively. A model using BPI and BMI showed comparable accuracy (AUROC, 0.844). Interobserver agreement for US measurements was high (Lin's coefficients 0.66-0.93). Thigh stiffness (2D-SWE) and phase angle did not correlate with SMI. Non-radiating tools, such as US-based thigh and psoas measurements, BIA-derived BPI, and anthropometry, are accurate alternatives to CT for detecting sarcopenia in patients with cirrhosis. These tools are simple, safe, and reproducible, which supports their integration into routine clinical practice for sarcopenia screening and monitoring.",

    "abstract": "Low skeletal muscle mass has been increasingly recognized as a negative prognostic factor in oncology. According to the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People 2 (EWGSOP2), sarcopenia is defined as a progressive and generalized skeletal muscle disorder characterized by the loss of muscle strength and muscle mass, which can lead to impaired physical performance. This study aimed to investigate whether baseline low muscle mass and dynamic changes in muscle mass during immunotherapy could predict treatment response and survival in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) treated with Nivolumab. This retrospective cohort study included 50 mRCC patients (35 men, 15 women; mean age 59.1 ± 10.2 years) who received Nivolumab between 2019 and 2022 and underwent abdominal computed tomography (CT) before and during treatment. Muscle mass was assessed by calculating the skeletal muscle index (SMI) at the third lumbar vertebra using standard Hounsfield unit thresholds (-29 to +150 HU). Treatment response was evaluated according to immune Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (iRECIST). Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression models. Low muscle mass was identified in 60% of patients and was significantly associated with multiple organ metastases (p = 0.003). Patients with baseline low muscle mass or a negative change in SMI during treatment demonstrated poorer treatment response (p = 0.027 and p = 0.021, respectively). Both OS and PFS were significantly shorter in patients with low muscle mass and those with declining muscle mass during treatment. Pre-treatment low muscle mass and muscle mass decline during immunotherapy were independently associated with inferior survival and treatment response in mRCC patients receiving Nivolumab. CT-based muscle mass assessment may serve as an imaging-based prognostic biomarker in this population.",

    "abstract": "Low muscle mass (LMM) and mild anemia (MA) are prevalent yet often overlooked conditions in middle-aged and older adults, each independently associated with adverse health outcomes. However, evidence regarding their combined effect on mortality remains limited. This study aimed to investigate the joint association of LMM and MA with all-cause, cardiovascular, and cancer mortality in a national sample of U.S. adults. We analyzed data from 10,313 participants aged 45 years and older from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2006 and 2011-2018, with mortality follow-up through December 2019. LMM was defined using appendicular skeletal muscle mass index (ASM/BMI), and MA was classified based on hemoglobin levels according to WHO criteria. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess individual and joint associations, adjusting for sociodemographic, lifestyle, and clinical factors. Over a median follow-up of 15.3 years, individuals with both LMM and MA had significantly elevated risks of all-cause (HR = 2.43; 95% CI: 1.82-3.26), cardiovascular (HR = 3.57; 95% CI: 2.31-5.52), and cancer mortality (HR = 3.86; 95% CI: 2.22-6.71) compared to those with neither condition. Significant additive and multiplicative interactions were observed between LMM and MA. Subgroup analyses revealed that the combined effect on cancer mortality was particularly pronounced in males and adults aged 65 years or older. The co-occurrence of LMM and MA is strongly associated with increased risks of all-cause, cardiovascular, and cancer mortality among middle-aged and older adults. These findings highlight the importance of integrated screening and management of both conditions to mitigate mortality risks.",

    "abstract": "Low muscle mass exhibits a high prevalence in population, with its incidence increasing with age. Body mass index (BMI) has been identified as an independent predictor of poor muscle quality, and people with higher BMI have higher risk of low muscle mass. Nutrition interventions have been demonstrated efficacy in mitigating its effects. The Healthy Eating Index-2020 (HEI-2020) assesses overall diet quality but lacks studies on its association with low muscle mass. This study aims to investigate the association between the HEI-2020 and low muscle mass and to explore the mediating role of BMI among middle-aged individuals. Participants aged 40-59 were recruited from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2011-2018. Muscle mass was quantified using the ratio of appendicular lean mass (ALM) to BMI, with low muscle mass criteria defined at 0.789 kg/kg/m The sample comprised 4,355 individuals with a median age of 50 (45, 55) years, of whom 9.7% had low muscle mass. The HEI-2020 scores ranged from 22.85 to 91.33, with an average score of 52.10 ± 11.78. Participants in the highest HEI-2020 score quartile had a 65% lower risk of low muscle mass compared to those in the lowest quartile. Adequate intake of vegetables, fruits, beans, proteins and fatty acids, along with restricted intake of added sugars, was associated with lower risk of low muscle mass. BMI was identified as a mediator, accounting for 33.1% of the association between HEI-2020 and low muscle mass. HEI-2020 was inversely associated with low muscle mass among middle-aged individuals. The impact of a healthy diet on muscle mass is partially mediated by BMI. Adhering to the healthy eating patterns and keeping a healthy weight is conducive to the maintenance of muscle mass and the prevention of low muscle mass.",

    "title": "Association Between the Phase Angle and Function Recovery in Patients With Hip Fractures.",
    "abstract": "Patients with hip fractures frequently present with malnutrition, and proper nutritional management is recognized as an important factor in their clinical care. We aimed to clarify whether the preoperative phase angle could predict postoperative functional recovery and to identify the impact of undernutrition on clinical outcomes in patients with hip fractures. For 100 hip fracture patients, serum albumin level and muscle mass on the admission day were recorded. Muscle mass was estimated using plain computed tomography (CT) images with the skeletal muscle index (SMI). All participants were subjected to bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), and the phase angle was calculated at admission. Functional Independence Measure (FIM) scores on admission and at two weeks postoperatively and ΔFIM (the difference between the FIM score on admission and the score at two weeks postoperatively) were determined. Correlations among the phase angle, serum albumin level, SMI, and FIM scores were assessed. Positive correlations were observed between the phase angle with both serum albumin level at admission (R=0.53, p<0.001) and SMI (R=0.43, p<0.001). Serum albumin level at admission and the phase angle were positively correlated with both the FIM score at two weeks postoperatively and ΔFIM. From multiple regression analysis with the FIM score at two weeks postoperatively or ΔFIM as the dependent variable, and the phase angle, serum albumin level at admission, and SMI as three independent variables, only the phase angle showed significant correlations with the FIM score at two weeks postoperatively (p<0.001) and ΔFIM (p<0.05). The preoperative phase angle could predict postoperative functional recovery and identify the impact of undernutrition and sarcopenia on clinical outcomes in patients with hip fractures.",

    "title": "A body shape index and sarcopenia risk in middle-aged and older adults: evidence from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study.",
    "abstract": "The A body shape index (ABSI) has been associated with various diseases, and existing research suggests a link with sarcopenia. However, systematic evaluations focusing on Asian populations-particularly middle-aged and older adults in China-remain insufficient, and the specific association mechanisms and predictive value have yet to be fully elucidated. This study aimed to examine this relationship utilizing data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) database. A total of 1873 participants aged ≥ 45 years with complete data from the 2015 CHARLS were included. Eligibility criteria required the availability of: (1) parameters necessary for ABSI calculation, namely, waist circumference (WC), height, and weight; (2) sarcopenia assessment components (muscle mass, grip strength (GS), and physical performance); and (3) all relevant covariates. Sarcopenia was diagnosed according to AWGS2019 guidelines, defined as low muscle mass (appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM)/height The cross-sectional analysis demonstrated significant differences in ABSI between individuals with sarcopenia (n = 329) and those without (n = 1544), with mean ABSI values of 4.59 and 3.71, respectively. The prevalence of sarcopenia was approximately 17.57% in the study population. All three models consistently indicated a significant association between ABSI and sarcopenia: Model 1 (odds ratio = 5.85, 95% confidence interval: 4.73-7.33), Model 2 (odds ratio = 5.34, 95% confidence interval: 4.23-6.83), and Model 3 (odds ratio = 5.22, 95% confidence interval: 4.10-6.74). The ROC analysis revealed that the fully adjusted model yielded an area under the curve of 0.871, compared to 0.760 for the ABSI-only model. In the KNN model, ABSI ranked highest in feature importance. ABSI is strongly associated with sarcopenia prevalence and functions as an independent indicator, suggesting its potential applicability in sarcopenia screening strategies.",

    "title": "Impact of muscle mass, muscle density and obesity on clinical outcomes in critically ill patients with COVID-19.",
    "abstract": "Obesity is generally recognized as an independent risk factor for poor outcomes in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19); however, some studies report a paradoxical protective effect. Findings may be mediated by low muscle mass, a relevant predictor of poor clinical outcomes in critically ill patients. We aimed to investigate the association of body mass index (BMI), baseline low muscle mass index (SMI) and low muscle density (SMD) with clinical outcomes in critically ill patients with COVID-19. This retrospective cohort study was conducted at a tertiary care center in São Paulo, Brazil. We included all consecutive patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) from March 1st, 2020, to May 31st, 2021, with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 and who had a measured SMI and SMD by thoracic computed tomography (CT) at admission. SMI and SMD were assessed from a transverse image at the level of the 12th thoracic vertebra (T12), and BMI at admission was calculated. The association between coprimary exposures BMI, low SMI, low SMD and hospital mortality was assessed through multivariable analysis accounting for confounding factors such as age, sex, Simplified Acute Physiology Score 3 (SAPS 3) and comorbidities. A total of 962 patients were included; 63.7 (±15.3) years; 75.8 % males. SMI was assessed in all patients; however, 33 with contrast CTs were excluded from the SMD analysis. The prevalence of low SMI was 21.6 % (208/962). The prevalence of low SMD was 22.7 % (211/929). A total of 391 (40.6 %) patients were classified as overweight, and 393 (40.8 %) as having obesity. Hospital mortality was 14.3 %, increasing to 26.2 % for patients aged ≥65 years. We found no significant association between BMI, SMI or SMD and hospital mortality. Patients with low SMI were more likely to undergo extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (P = 0.045), required longer duration of mechanical ventilation (MV) (p < 0.001), and had prolonged ICU and hospital stays (p < 0.001). Low SMD was independently associated only with ICU readmission (p = 0.034) and longer hospital stay (p < 0.001). Patients with a higher BMI were more likely to be intubated and placed under MV (p < 0.001). Higher BMI was also associated with longer ICU (p = 0.001) and hospital stays (p = 0.049). Patients with obesity and low SMI had longer ICU (p = 0.033), and hospital (p < 0.001) stays, and extended MV duration compared to those with obesity and normal SMI (p = 0.003). BMI, low SMI, and low SMD were not associated with in-hospital mortality in this cohort. However, these parameters were important predictors of morbidity, including longer ICU and hospital stays, greater need for mechanical ventilation, and ICU readmissions. These findings highlight the importance of assessing body composition parameters in critically ill patients with COVID-19.",

This study aimed to identify the most accurate muscle predictor of morbidity and mortality in patients with cirrhosis on the liver transplant waiting list. A prospective, single-center study included all consenting adult liver transplant candidates from June 2021 to October 2023. Skeletal muscle mass index, muscle density, and myosteatosis were assessed via computed tomography at third lumbar vertebrae. Frailty was evaluated using the liver frailty index and the 6-minute walk test. Among 194 screened patients, 135 were listed for transplant, including 108 with cirrhosis. Alcohol-related liver disease was the leading etiology, 47 % were listed for hepatocellular carcinoma. Myopenia was present in 31 %, myosteatosis in 34 %, and 20 % were frail. One-year survival was 82 %. Myosteatosis was the strongest univariate predictor of mortality, but in multivariate analysis, the five times sit to stand test was the best predictor of morbi-mortality. The five times sit to stand test emerged as the most robust predictor in multivariate analysis. Its simplicity and reliability make it a valuable tool for identifying high-risk patients on the liver transplant waiting list.",

    "title": "Green tea consumption is associated with lower risk of sarcopenia in Chinese community-dwelling older adults.",
    "abstract": "Sarcopenia is an age-related progressive disease characterized by loss of muscle mass accompanied with low muscle strength and/or physical performance. The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between green tea intake and sarcopenia in a Chinese population of community-dwelling older adults. A cross-sectional retrospective study with 2553 participants aged ≥65 years was performed. Appendicular skeletal muscle mass index (ASMI), grip strength, and gait speed were measured to assess sarcopenia. A quantitative questionnaire was used to obtain information of green tea consumption. Sarcopenia group had lower proportion of green tea consumers when compared to the non-sarcopenia group (21.6% vs. 28.1%, P = .001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that green tea intake was associated with decreased risk of sarcopenia (OR = 0.695, 95% CI = 0.547-0.882, P = .003). Subgroup analysis demonstrated that the association of green tea intake with sarcopenia was significant in individuals who drank a small amount (<125 g/month) and weak tea. Moreover, green tea consumers had higher ASMI and faster gait speed than non-green tea consumers. Our results suggest that green tea intake is associated with decreased risk of sarcopenia in a Chinese population of older adults, especially for those who prefer weak tea. Key messages What is already known on this topic: Although in vitro and in vivo studies have shown the protective effects of polyphenols on aging-related muscle loss and muscle dysfunction; however, the relationship between green tea consumption and the risk of sarcopenia remains unclear. What this study adds: Our findings demonstrate that green tea consumers had higher appendicular skeletal muscle mass index and faster gait speed than non-green tea consumers. Moreover, green tea consumption is associated with lower risk of sarcopenia in the older adults, especially for those who prefer weak tea. How this study might affect research, practice or policy: Our results suggest that drinking proper amount of green tea might be a health-promoting lifestyle for the prevention of sarcopenia in the older adults.",

    "abstract": "Sarcopenia is a progressive skeletal muscle disorder characterized by declining muscle mass and function in older adults. This study aimed to develop and validate a four-year predictive model for sarcopenia using data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) to facilitate early identification and targeted interventions. We analyzed data from 2,173 participants enrolled in the 2011 CHARLS baseline survey after applying exclusion criteria. Predictors including anthropometric measurements, laboratory biomarkers, and cognitive function were assessed. Data were split 7:3 for training and testing, with oversampling applied to address class imbalance in the training set. LASSO regression with 10-fold cross-validation was used for feature selection, followed by multivariable logistic regression to identify significant predictors. Model performance was evaluated using ROC curves, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA). Among 2,173 participants, 160 (7.36%) developed sarcopenia over four years. Univariate analyses showed area under the curve (AUC) values ranging from 0.461 to 0.818. Ten significant predictors were identified: age, body mass index (BMI), cognition, waist circumference, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), platelet count, glucose, creatinine, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), and hematocrit. Advancing age and higher MCV were positively associated with sarcopenia, whereas higher BMI, larger waist circumference, and better cognitive function were protective. The model showed excellent discrimination with AUCs of 0.859 (training) and 0.842 (testing), good calibration, and favorable clinical utility across a range of thresholds. An online nomogram was developed for clinical application. This study developed and validated a four-year predictive model for sarcopenia in older adults, integrating key risk factors into a user-friendly nomogram. The model enables early identification of high-risk individuals, supporting targeted interventions and enhancing sarcopenia management strategies. External validation is recommended to confirm generalizability.",

    "title": "Higher Circulating Kynurenine Levels Linked to Higher Risk of Sarcopenia in Older Adults: A Cohort Study and UK Biobank Analysis.",
    "abstract": "While experimental studies show kynurenine, a tryptophan metabolite, drives muscle catabolism through pro-oxidative and inflammatory mechanisms, clinical evidence linking circulating kynurenine to sarcopenia in humans remains scarce. In a cross-sectional study of 165 community-dwelling older adults, sarcopenia was diagnosed using Asian-specific criteria and serum kynurenine levels were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Using UK Biobank datasets, plasma indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1)-the enzyme converting tryptophan to kynurenine-was quantified via Olink proteomics, and Mendelian randomization was used to assess the causal effect of plasma IDO1 on sarcopenia risk based on genomewide association study data. In multivariable adjusted analyses, older adults with sarcopenia, low muscle mass, or weak muscle strength had 21.3%-29.2% higher serum kynurenine concentrations than controls (P<0.001 to 0.010). Circulating kynurenine levels were inversely correlated with skeletal muscle index and grip strength (P=0.001 and 0.022, respectively). Each standard deviation increase in serum kynurenine was associated with a 1.80-2.97-fold increased risk for sarcopenia-related outcomes (P<0.001 to 0.010). In the UK Biobank, higher IDO1 activity was associated with reduced muscle mass and strength (P=0.007 and P=0.004, respectively), and Mendelian randomization indicated a significant causal relationship between plasma IDO1 levels and increased sarcopenia risk (P= 0.010, β=0.105). These findings extend previous experimental evidence to the clinical setting, suggesting that elevated kynurenine-driven by IDO1 activity-contributes to sarcopenia in older adults. Circulating kynurenine may serve as an exploratory biomarker candidate for identifying individuals at heightened risk for muscle deterioration, warranting further validation in future studies.",

This retrospective study included 146 GCs who underwent gastrectomy. Body compositions of GCs at baseline and 12 months after surgery were automatically measured utilizing the AI-based segmentation tool. The differences in body compositions at baseline and 12 months after surgery were assessed. Subgroup analyses of body composition changes stratified by clinicopathological characteristics were conducted. Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) correction was utilized for all subgroup analyses. All body composition parameters, including bone mineral density (BMD), adipose tissue, and muscle, decreased significantly 12 months after surgery (all p < 0.001). The greatest losses were observed in adipose-related compositions. The proportions of sarcopenia (from 37.7% to 55.5%) and osteoporosis (from 13.7% to 26.7%) showed significant increases. Subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissues, abdominal wall muscle, and skeletal muscle losses indicated significant differences in gender and body mass index (BMI) subgroups (all FDR p < 0.05). Adipose- and muscle-related losses differed significantly in GCs underwent different types of gastrectomy (all FDR p < 0.05), while BMD loss showed no significant difference. Subgroup analyses based on pathological stages showed no significant difference for body composition changes. BMD, adipose-related, and muscle-related body compositions showed significant losses over 12 months in GCs underwent gastrectomy. The greatest losses were observed in adipose-related compositions. The proportions of sarcopenia and osteoporosis showed significant increases. Gender, baseline BMI, and gastrectomy differences affected adipose- and muscle-related body composition losses but showed no significant effect on BMD.",

    "title": "Efficacy of Baduanjin Exercise for Sarcopenia in Older Adults: A 24-Week Randomized Controlled Trial.",
    "abstract": "Sarcopenia, a condition characterized by a substantial reduction in muscle mass and decreased muscle function, is a common degenerative condition in older adults. Regular Baduanjin exercise (BE) is deemed an effective intervention for improving muscle function in older adults. It is a traditional Chinese practice of qigong that combines gentle exercise, breathing techniques and meditation, in the elderly population. However, randomized controlled trials on the efficacy of BE in preventing and treating sarcopenia among older adults remain limited. The aim of our study was to assess the efficacy of a systematic BE regimen based on the short physical performance battery (SPPB) in managing sarcopenia. By establishing a clear link between BE and improvements in muscle function, this study reveals valuable insights into nonpharmacological strategies for the prevention and treatment of sarcopenia. This is a 24-week randomized controlled trial involving 90 participants aged 60-77 years who were diagnosed with primary sarcopenia. The participants were randomly assigned by SAS software to either BE or a resistance training (RT) group. Both groups undertook their respective training under professional supervision from July 2022 to August 2023 in Chengdu, China. The intervention consisted of 60-minute sessions, three times a week for 24 weeks. Participants were evaluated at baseline, Week 12 (midintervention) and Week 24 (postintervention) using the primary outcome measure, SPPB, along with secondary indicators, including limb muscle mass, two-handed grip strength and other indicators, which were analysed using a generalized estimating equation (GEE) model. Generalized estimating equations were used to assess 24-week postintervention effects. Among the entire group, which consisted of 13 males and 77 females, significant differences (p < 0.05) were noted between the BE and RT in several measures: SPPB scores (B = 1.94 [95% CI, 1.20-2.68]), balance (B = 0.76 [95% CI, 0.31-1.22]), lower limb strength (B = 0.75 [95% CI, 0.25 to 1.24]), gait speed (B = 0.41 [95% CI, 0.01-0.81]), skeletal muscle index (SMI) (B = 0.37 [95% CI, 0.25-0.50]), left leg muscle mass (B = 0.38 [95% CI, 0.23-0.52]), right leg muscle mass (B = 0.34 [95% CI, 0.17-0.51]) and right hand grip strength (B = 1.56 [95% CI, 1.13-1.99]). No significant differences were found in the muscle mass of the left arm, right arm or left handgrip strength or in the results of the 6-m walk test. Regular BE markedly improved muscle function and increased muscle mass in older adults with sarcopenia, indicating a safe and effective exercise for sarcopenia management. BE, which was tailored using the short physical performance battery assessment, offers a valuable approach to help prevent and treat sarcopenia in older adults. Future research should investigate the long-term effects of varying BE intensities and frequencies in individuals with sarcopenia. Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2100051871).",

    "title": "Determination of Ultrasound Reference Values for Diagnosing Low Muscle Mass in Older Chinese Adults.",
    "abstract": "Ultrasound is a promising tool for diagnosing sarcopenia, yet standardized cut-off points and criteria are currently lacking. This study aimed to identify the optimal muscle sites and reference values for diagnosing low muscle mass in older Chinese adults using ultrasound, with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) as the reference standard, and to compare its diagnostic performance with bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). We included 1011 participants aged over 60 years. Fat thickness (FT), muscle thickness (MT) and muscle cross-section area (CSA) at various sites, including biceps brachii, rectus abdominis, rectus femoris, vastus intermedius, vastus lateralis, vastus medialis and tibialis anterior, were assessed for participants. DXA measurements were used as the standard for defining low muscle mass. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and 10-fold cross-validation were conducted to evaluate the prediction performance of ultrasound parameters for low muscle mass. The Youden index was employed to determine optimal cut-offs, while sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were calculated to assess diagnostic performance. Intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) were used to evaluate inter-rater reliability between two examiners. In males, the biceps brachii CSA (AUC = 0.832, 95% CI: 0.793-0.870) and in females, the tibialis anterior MT (0.833, 95% CI: 0.789-0.877) demonstrated superior predictive power for low muscle mass compared with other ultrasound parameters. A biceps brachii CSA < 7.1 cm Muscle ultrasound demonstrated excellent inter-rater reliability and stronger associations with adverse health outcomes compared with DXA and BIA, making ultrasound a preferable tool for assessing low muscle mass. This study provides valuable reference values for ultrasound-based diagnosis of sarcopenia in older Chinese adults.",

    "abstract": "Sarcopenia is increasingly recognized as a major prognostic factor in liver surgery. The present study aimed to investigate the impact of preoperative sarcopenia on postoperative morbidity and mortality following major hepatectomy for malignant liver tumours. The present retrospective cohort study included 104 patients who underwent major hepatectomy between 2019 and 2024. Sarcopenia was assessed using preoperative computed tomography scans to calculate the L3 skeletal muscle index (L3-SMI), with established sex-specific cut-offs. Postoperative outcomes were compared between sarcopenic and nonsarcopenic patients. Of the 104 patients, 56 (53.8%) were classified as having sarcopenia. Sarcopenic patients had a significantly lower Body mass ındex (26.4 ± 3.7 vs. 28.4 ± 4.0 kg/m²; p = 0.011) and a greater proportion of males (71.4% vs. 41.7%; p = 0.002). Although there was a higher rate of postoperative morbidity in sarcopenic patients (55.3% vs. 39.6%), the difference did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.108). No significant differences were found in 90-day mortality (10.7% vs. 12.5%, p = 0.776) or long-term mortality (66.1% vs. 58.3%, p = 0.416) between the groups. Preoperative sarcopenia is associated with a higher risk of postoperative morbidity following major hepatectomy. However, preoperative sarcopenia does not significantly affect short-term or long-term mortality. Routine assessment of muscle mass should be considered in preoperative evaluations to identify vulnerable patients and tailor perioperative management strategies.",

However, the impact of sarcopenia on clinical outcomes post-AP is poorly explored. A search of PUBMED, MEDLINE, and EMBASE databases was performed, and studies published between January 1990 and October 2024 were included. Ten studies with 2841 patients with a median age of 56.3 years were included. The number of patients with mild, moderate, and severe AP were 771, 545, and 399, respectively. Nine studies used skeletal muscle mass/skeletal muscle index/skeletal muscle attenuation, and one used visceral fat/muscle mass ratio as indicators of sarcopenia, measuring muscle mass at L3 vertebra or measuring psoas muscle volume. One longitudinal study reported that 80% of patients with severe AP were sarcopenic at 12 months. There was a strong correlation between sarcopenia and adverse clinical outcomes and mortality. There is no data on the impact of sarcopenia on quality of life (QOL). This review suggests an association between sarcopenia and the severity of AP in addition to worse postpancreatitis outcomes. Further prospective studies are needed with standardized definitions for sarcopenia with longitudinal follow-up reporting on QOL.",

Place and Duration of the Study: Department of Endocrinology, the First College of Clinical Medical Science, China Three Gorges University, Yichang Central People's Hospital, Hubei, China, from December 2024 to April 2025. Data were obtained from 11,176 eligible adults who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) conducted from 1999 to 2006. The sarcopenia index (SI) was computed as the ratio of appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM, kg), measured using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, to body mass index (BMI, kg/m2). The cohort was stratified into quartiles based on the SI (Q1-Q4). Mortality follow-up lasted until December 31, 2019. A multivariable Cox proportional hazards model was used to evaluate the association between the SI and all-cause mortality. Non-linear relationships were assessed using restricted cubic splines, and subgroup analyses were performed to assess effect modification. After accounting for demographic, socio-economic, lifestyle, and clinical factors, there was an inverse, non-linear relationship between SI and all-cause mortality. Specifically, the mortality risk in the Q4 group (highest SI quartile) was 24% lower than in the Q1 group (lowest SI quartile; p <0.05). In participants with metabolic abnormalities, such as overweight/obese, hypertension, or impaired glucose metabolism, higher SI was significantly linked to reduced mortality. Moreover, using the Kaplan-Meier analysis, the Q4 group featured the best prognosis, while the Q1 group had the lowest survival rate. Sarcopenia, assessed by the SI, has a significant correlation with all-cause mortality. Moreover, a strong association between them was observed in populations with metabolic abnormalities.

    "abstract": "Prolonged bed rest is highly prevalent among hospitalized older adults and markedly accelerates the loss of muscle mass and physical function. Currently, there are no effective interventions to counteract this decline, and the underlying mechanisms remain poorly characterized. This study aimed to investigate whether high protein intake can simultaneously modulate muscle mass and the gut microbiota, and whether gut microbial composition mediates muscle regulation in hospitalized older people. A self-controlled study was conducted on 43 older patients aged 60 to 90 years old with low skeletal muscle mass. During the 3-month intervention phase, all participants received approximately 36 g of high-protein supplementation daily, comprising both casein and whey proteins. This was followed by a 3-month control phase in which participants received standard nursing care without protein supplementation. A significant increase in skeletal muscle mass index from baseline was seen in male group at 3 months (6.0-6.3 kg/m High-protein supplementation may promote muscle anabolism in hospitalized older males by modulating the composition and metabolic function of the gut microbiota, specifically by enhancing microbial pathways related to amino acid synthesis. These results suggest the presence of a gut-muscle axis and highlight the potential of targeted protein interventions to counteract inactivity-related muscle loss in older patients.

    "abstract": "Although nutritional supplementation and exercise have shown independent efficacy in managing sarcopenia, data supporting their combined implementation in real-world clinical settings remain limited. This 12-week multicenter randomized controlled trial enrolled 110 older adults (≥ 65 years) with sarcopenia or possible sarcopenia. Participants were randomly allocated (1:1) to either the intervention group (n = 55) or control group (n = 55). In addition to their habitual diets, the intervention group received daily muscle-targeted oral nutritional supplementation (MT-ONS, 2 × 10 g sachets/day: containing 8.4 g protein, 0.5 g calcium β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate, 200 IU D3 per sachet) alongside a structured exercise programs featuring twice-weekly resistance training (20 min/session), alternate-day chair-based exercises (10 min/session), and home-based activity recommendations. Control group participants maintained their habitual dietary and physical activity patterns without intervention. All outcome measures were assessed at baseline and post-intervention. The intervention group showed modest increases in BIA-derived appendicular lean tissue (mean change + 0.60 kg, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.88), skeletal muscle index (+ 0.20 kg/m², 95% CI 0.11 to 0.29), and handgrip strength (+ 2.22 kg, 95% CI 1.35 to 3.09) compared with the control group. Improvements were also observed in walking speed, chair-stand performance, Short Physical Performance Battery scores, serum vitamin D, and EQ-5D measures of quality of life. A 12-week combined intervention of multi-ingredient nutritional supplementation and exercise led to modest improvements in proxy measures of muscle mass, strength, function, and quality of life in older adults. As muscle mass was not directly measured and the study did not employ a factorial design, the relative contributions of exercise and supplementation cannot be determined. These findings suggest that combined interventions may help attenuate, rather than reverse, sarcopenia-related decline.

However, evidence supporting the use of CCR in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) remains limited. Thus, we aimed to evaluate whether CCR could be a marker of muscle mass for predicting prognosis in patients with CKD. We searched PubMed, Embase, Wanfang, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases up to March 15, 2025. Studies were included if they reported a relationship between CCR and muscle measurements or prognosis in adults with CKD. The risk of bias in non-randomized studies-of exposures tool was used to assess the quality of the study. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. This review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines. Nine studies (seven cohort and two cross-sectional studies) involving 31,673 adults were included. The quality of the included studies ranged from moderate to high. Pooling the results from multifactorial analyses showed that CCR can reliably predict mortality, either using CCR as a category variable [ This meta-analysis suggests that CCR could serve as a valuable tool for evaluating muscle mass, as well as an indicator of nutritional status and an independent predictor of prognosis in patients with CKD. These findings encourage the use of CCR in this patient population.

    "title": "Myostatin, activin-A and follistatin are produced by the tumor in head and neck cancer and likely contribute to sarcopenia: A case-control, cross-sectional exploratory study.",
    "abstract": "Myostatin (M), activin-A (A) and follistatin (F), three TGF-β superfamily members, play a role in cancer sarcopenia. The aim of our study was to assess the association of MAF in head and neck cancer (HNC) skeletal muscle loss. This prospective study involved 55 patients, 32 with HNC and 23 controls. The patients underwent a full nutritional assessment just before surgery. Tumor, muscle and plasma were harvested at the time of surgery. Plasma was harvested a second time 7 days after the procedure. Tumor explants were cultured and MAF were measured in the incubation medium. A and F plasma levels were higher in cancer patients compared to control (320 vs. 203 pg/ml, p < 0.001, ES = 0.96 95 % CI [0.40; 1.52] and 3593 vs 2148 pg/ml, p < 0.001, ES = 1.10 95%CI [0.53; 1.66], respectively) and M plasma level lower (1542 vs. 2100 pg/ml, p = 0.01, ES = -0.70 95%CI [-1.24; -0.15]). M plasma level was correlated with the skeletal muscle index at the third lumbar vertebra (r = 0.44; p < 0.05) and negatively correlated with weight loss (r = -0.65; p < 0.05) and the C Reactive protein level (-0.44; p = 0.02). At the seventh postoperative day (D), A was increased (D7 vs D0) in the cancer group (379 vs 320 pg/ml; p < 0.001) while the concentrations of M and F were unchanged from the presurgical level. There was no difference between groups in the transcript levels of M and A in skeletal muscles. MAF were systematically detected in the tumor incubation medium with no correlation between tumor incubation medium level and plasma level at D0. The MAF secretory profile is modified in HNC. In particular, A seems to play a role in muscle loss while F protects against skeletal muscle mass loss.",

    "title": "Benefit of home-based virtual reality aerobic exercise combined with resistance training for reversing sarcopenia and reducing depression in community-dwelling older adults with sarcopenia: a randomized control trial.",
    "abstract": "Sarcopenia is a growing concern owing to an aging global population. Older people with depression are at risk for sarcopenia and vice versa. Although physical exercise is key in preventing and managing sarcopenia, virtual reality (VR)-based exercises have emerged as an engaging alternative that may also alleviate depressive symptoms and enhance quality of life in older adults. However, the effects of VR exercise on depression in individuals with sarcopenia who are at higher risk of both physical decline and psychological distress remain underexplored. This study aimed to explore the benefits of home-based VR aerobic exercise combined with resistance training for reversing sarcopenia and depression in community-dwelling older adults with sarcopenia. This blinded randomized controlled trial enrolled 46 community-dwelling older adults with sarcopenia (37 females and 9 males); they were categorized into the home-based VR (n = 23) group receiving non-immersive VR aerobic exercise combined with a resistance program and the control group (CG) receiving self-care education (CG; n = 23). The VR program combined aerobic and resistance exercises, performed three times weekly for 12 weeks. Sarcopenia risk indicators, including gait speed, handgrip strength, skeletal muscle mass index (SMI), and depression scores, were examined before and after the intervention. A two-way mixed repeated-measures analysis of variance was performed. The VR group showed significant improvements in depressive symptoms (F(1,44)=51.80, p< 0.001), SMI (F(1,44) =28.07, p< 0.001), handgrip strength (F(1,44) = 66.74, p< 0.001, np Home-based VR aerobic exercise combined with resistance training improves muscle mass, muscle strength, and physical performance and reduces depression in older adults with sarcopenia. Thus, it may be applied to effectively prevent or reverse sarcopenia and decrease depression among older adults. The Thai Clinical Trials Registry is TCTR20231005004.",

    "abstract": "Sarcopenia, defined as the loss of skeletal muscle mass and function, is common in gastric cancer (GC) patients and has been associated with adverse outcomes. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of sarcopenia on postoperative complications, mortality, and long-term survival following gastrectomy for GC. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 337 patients who underwent gastrectomy with curative intent at a single tertiary centre between 2000 and 2017. Sarcopenia was defined using CT-based skeletal muscle index at the L3 level, threshold values of ≤ 39 cm²/m² for women and ≤ 55 cm²/m² for men. The primary outcome was overall survival (OS). Postoperative complication burden assessed using the Comprehensive Complication Index (CCI), along with 30- and 90-day mortality and, disease-specific survival (DSS), and disease-free survival (DFS) formed secondary outcomes. Sarcopenia was present in 174 (51.6%) and 163 (48.4%) patients were defined as non-sarcopenic. Complication burden, 30- and 90-day mortality, and DSS/DFS did not differ by sarcopenia status. In the overall cohort, sarcopenia was not independently associated with OS. However, a significant sarcopenia × stage interaction was observed: sarcopenia predicted poorer OS in stage 0-II patients (HR 1.82, 95% CI 1.05-3.17, P = 0.034) but not in stage III-IV disease. Sarcopenia was not associated with increased postoperative morbidity or short-term mortality, but in stage 0-II GC it was an adverse prognostic factor, conferring an 82% higher risk of death. Routine CT-based assessment may help identify high-risk early-stage patients who could benefit from timely nutritional and physical interventions.",

    "abstract": "Phase angle (PhA) reflects cellular integrity and muscle quality. However, evidence is limited regarding whether an increase in PhA is associated with improvements in activities of daily living (ADL) and skeletal muscle mass. This study aimed to investigate the association between change in PhA and prognosis in terms of ADL and skeletal muscle mass in post-stroke patients undergoing rehabilitation. This retrospective cohort study was conducted at a convalescent rehabilitation hospital in Japan. Patients with a PhA at admission below the cutoff values (4.76° for males and 4.11° for females) were included. Patients were categorized into a PhA-increase group (>0) and a non-increase group (≤0). Outcomes included the Functional Independence Measure (FIM)-motor score and skeletal muscle mass index (SMI) at discharge. Multivariate regression was used to assess associations. A total of 253 patients were included (mean age 78.0 ± 10.9 years; 51% women). The median [IQR] PhA at admission was 3.70° [3.20, 4.10], and the median change during hospitalization was 0.00° [-0.20, 0.30]. Of these, 119 patients had increased PhA and 134 did not. Change in PhA was independently associated with higher FIM-motor scores (β = 0.078, P = 0.040) and greater SMI (β = 0.454, P < 0.001) at discharge. In post-stroke patients, an increase in PhA during hospitalization was associated with better functional and muscular outcomes. PhA may therefore serve as a valuable biomarker for assessing the efficacy of rehabilitation.",

Participants who admitted to a geriatric outpatient clinic of a university hospital were included in this study. Comprehensive geriatric assessments were recorded. The European Working Group of Sarcopenia in Older People 2 criteria were used to evaluate sarcopenia and probable sarcopenia. Masseter muscle thickness (MMT) was measured bilaterally by ultrasonography. The sum of the mean MMT values for the right and left sides was divided into two equal parts, and the average of these two parts was recorded as the average MMT (AMMT). Masseter muscle was grouped into 3 types according to band appearances. State of dentition was evaluated according to the Eichner index. >Fourty-six participants whose median age was 73 were included in the study (19.6% probable sarcopenic, 30.4% sarcopenic). AMMT was significantly lower in those with high SARC-F scores compared to low SARC-F score group (p=0.041). AMMT, the distribution of Eichner groups, right and left masseter muscle fibriller types were similar in probable sarcopenia, sarcopenia and non-sarcopenic groups (p˃0.05). AMMT was significantly correlated with handgrip strength, appendicular skeletal muscle mass, calf circumference. Left-sided functional tooth units correlated positively with left MMT, whereas the Eichner index was not independently associated with sarcopenia. Decreased MMT might be useful as a predictor of low appendicular skeletal muscle mass.",

This study aims to investigate the association between skeletal muscle index (SMI) and lung function indicators in populations with different characteristics, with particular emphasis on the PRISm population.MethodsData were utilized from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2011-2012 cycle. The participants were categorized into three groups: obstructive spirometry, PRISm, and normal spirometry. The SMI was calculated by dividing appendicular skeletal muscle mass by body mass index. Multiple linear regression analysis was employed to explore the relationship between the SMI and lung function indicators, including forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC).ResultsAmong the 2513 participants aged 20-59 years, 2096 had normal spirometry, 186 were in the obstructive spirometry group, and 231 were in the PRISm group. The SMI was significantly associated with lung function indicators after adujustment: in the obstructive spirometry group, per 0.1 unit increase in SMI was linked to an increase in FEV1 of 0.214 L (95% CI: 0.115-0.313, ",

    "abstract": "Sarcopenia and systemic inflammatory markers predict prognosis in various cancers, including head and neck cancer (HNC) treated with surgery or chemoradiotherapy. Their significance in patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), however, remains unclear. This study aims to determine whether skeletal muscle loss and systemic inflammation influence treatment response and survival in ICI-treated HNC, and whether composite indices provide prognostic value. A retrospective cohort of 179 patients with histologically confirmed recurrent or metastatic (R/M) HNC who received ICI therapy between April 2017 and July 2024 was analyzed. Sarcopenia was assessed using the lumbar skeletal muscle index (LSMI), calculated from cervical CT images. Inflammatory markers such as neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR) were derived from pre-treatment blood samples. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier estimates, and prognostic factors were identified through Cox regression analysis. Among the 179 patients, 98 (54.7%) were classified as sarcopenic. These patients had significantly shorter median OS compared to non-sarcopenic patients (12.1 vs. 39.8 months; p < 0.001). Univariate analysis identified sarcopenia, BMI, NLR, and PLR as significant predictors of OS. However, multivariate Cox analysis revealed that only sarcopenia remained an independent prognostic factor for both OS (HR 1.94; 95% CI: 1.15-3.27; p = 0.013) and PFS (HR 1.92; 95% CI: 1.33-2.75; p < 0.001). Inflammatory markers and their composite indices failed to retain prognostic significance in adjusted models. Sarcopenia independently predicts poor survival outcomes in patients with R/M HNC undergoing ICI therapy, whereas conventional inflammatory markers such as NLR, PLR, and LMR, alone or in combination with sarcopenia, lack independent prognostic value. Routine pre-treatment evaluation of skeletal muscle mass using CT imaging may offer a practical and effective tool for patient risk stratification.",

The aim of this study is measuring muscle mass variables in healthy young Greek population and set their reference values. Between June 2020 and June 2022, we recruited (convenience sampling) 185 healthy adults (103 males and 82 females) measured their body composition using two different methods. Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA) and Dual Energy X - Ray Absorptiometry (DXA). We calculated cut-off values as mean - 2 SDs. Appendicular Lean Mass Index cut-off values for Greek males are 5.61 kg/m2 and 4.06 kg/m2 for females, Skeletal Muscle Mass Index cut-off values are 9.66 kg/m2 for males and 7.83 kg/m2 for females. We estimated cut-off values of normal skeletal muscle mass values in a rather selected sample of healthy Greek adult population. Since to our knowledge this is the first study of this type in Greece, these values are a useful tool towards better defining sarcopenia, but there is need to validate them in studies including rural and urban population and in sarcopenia studies in older people. gov ID: NCT04584944.",

The primary outcome was the change in SMI between vitamin D and control groups; secondary outcomes were changes in LM, FM, and handgrip strength. Seven randomized controlled trials met eligibility criteria. Mean age ranged from 60 to 74 years, participants ranged from 50 to 1094, and study durations ranged from 3 to 36 months. The mean baseline 25(OH)D concentration ranged from 15.1 to 33.0 ng/mL. The vitamin D intake group was not associated with an increase in SMI, LM, or handgrip strength compared to the control group, although a decrease in FM was observed. In the meta-analysis excluding studies that used active vitamin D, the vitamin D intake group was not associated with increases in SMI, LM, or handgrip strength, nor with a decrease in FM compared to the control group. In the present study, vitamin D intake did not increase SMI, LM, or handgrip strength in the elderly individuals, although a possible decrease in FM was observed. Further studies are needed to better elucidate the effects of vitamin D on body composition in the elderly.",

    "abstract": "Sarcopenia and adiposity at diagnosis are important prognostic factors in cancer. Ongoing changes in body composition during chemotherapy treatment may have additional prognostic relevance. This study aimed to investigate the association between body composition changes during neoadjuvant treatment and survival in patients with colorectal liver metastases. In this subgroup analysis of the newEPOC RCT (NCT00482222), pre- and post-treatment CT-scans of patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy for colorectal liver metastases were studied. The total cross-sectional area of skeletal muscle tissue (SM), Visceral Adipose Tissue (VAT), Subcutaneous Adipose Tissue (SAT), Intra-Muscular Adipose Tissue (IMAT), and radiation attenuation for skeletal muscle (SM-RA) were determined. During neoadjuvant therapy, SM-index decreased from 50.6 ± 8.7 to 47.6 ± 8.6 cm The body composition features SM and SM-RA decreased during chemotherapy, but were not associated with survival. On the contrary, although VAT did not significantly change, the gain of VAT was an independent prognostic factor for survival. These results should be validated in independent cohorts but may indicate that in this selected patient group, adipose tissue might be a more important prognostic factor than sarcopenia.",

    "abstract": "We evaluated longitudinal changes in sarcopenia status using the operational definition in patients with advanced knee osteoarthritis and limited mobility. In this prospective cohort study, we enrolled Korean women aged ≥ 60 years who underwent total knee arthroplasty (TKA) for primary osteoarthritis. Sarcopenia assessments based on the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia 2019 definition and clinical outcomes were collected preoperatively and at 6 and 12 months postoperatively. Differences by sarcopenia status and longitudinal changes were analyzed using linear mixed models (LMMs). We also examined the proportion of patients meeting diagnostic criteria for each sarcopenia item and analyzed the changes from preoperative values. Among the 146 participants (mean age 71.8 ± 6.2 years), 106 and 79 were followed up at 6 months and 1 year, respectively. Preoperative physical performance was not assessed in 7 patients (4.8%, 10 knees) owing to pain. At all time points, the sarcopenic group showed lower skeletal muscle mass index (SMI) than the non-sarcopenic group, with no other differences except preoperative short physical performance battery score (p = 0.015). Longitudinally, TKA improved outcomes and performance, while handgrip strength declined and SMI remained stable. The proportion of participants meeting low physical performance criteria decreased postoperatively, whereas those meeting low handgrip strength increased. TKA improved physical performance longitudinally, whereas muscle strength and mass did not. Grouping according to the operational definition revealed no postoperative differences in physical performance or muscle strength. The current operational definition of sarcopenia may be unsuitable for patients with severe knee osteoarthritis, as joint pain influences physical performance. Prospective comparative study.

    "abstract": "Sarcopenic obesity is a condition characterized by decreased muscle mass and strength along with an increased body fat percentage. While previous studies have separately examined the relationship between sarcopenia and obesity with urinary incontinence (UI), this study aimed to evaluate the combined impact of sarcopenic obesity on UI. This study included 1147 female patients aged ≥ 60 years who attended a geriatrics outpatient clinic between November 2012 and June 2024. Body composition was assessed using bioimpedance analysis (BIA), and muscle strength was measured by handgrip strength. The skeletal muscle mass index (SMMI) was adjusted for body weight. Sarcopenic obesity was defined using population-specific threshold values, incorporating low muscle strength, low muscle mass, and high fat percentage. Patients were classified into four groups: non-sarcopenic non-obese, sarcopenic non-obese, sarcopenic obese, and non-sarcopenic obese. The prevalence of UI and its association with these phenotypes was analyzed using multivariable logistic regression. The mean age was 74 ± 7 years. The prevalence of sarcopenic obesity was 20%, while the prevalence of UI was 49%. UI was observed in 57% of the 230 patients with sarcopenic obesity. A significant difference in UI prevalence was found among phenotypic groups (p < 0.001). In multivariable regression analysis, sarcopenic obesity was independently associated with UI (OR: 1.82, 95% CI: 1.16-2.85, p = 0.009). Other phenotypes were not significantly associated. Sarcopenic obesity is more strongly associated with UI than sarcopenia or obesity alone. Early identification and targeted interventions may play a crucial role in mitigating the effects of UI or reducing its incidence.",

    "abstract": "Sarcopenia is a progressive loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength with major clinical and economic consequences. While traditional models emphasize mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, and proteostasis imbalance, emerging data highlight a neurogenic component involving motor neuron loss, fiber denervation, neuromuscular junction remodeling, and disrupted trophic signaling. To synthesize current evidence on neurogenic mechanisms of sarcopenia revealed by next-generation sequencing and related multi-omics, to map molecular networks across cell types, and to outline translational opportunities for diagnostics and targeted therapy. A narrative review of human and animal studies indexed in PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus through November 2025. Search terms combined sarcopenia, denervation, neuromuscular junction, neurotrophic signaling, genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, single-cell, and spatial transcriptomics. Eligible studies reported omics or physiological endpoints related to neuromuscular function. Convergent omics data support a central role of the nervous system in the onset and progression of sarcopenia. Genetic and regulatory factors linked to denervation, transcriptomic signatures of junctional disassembly, and cell-specific dysfunctions in motor neurons, Schwann cells, satellite cells, and fibro-adipogenic progenitors have been identified. Epigenetic and transcriptional networks underlying neuromuscular homeostasis, along with candidate circulating biomarkers, provide targets for clinical translation. Neurogenic sarcopenia represents a tractable target for precision prevention and therapy. Integration of multi-omics, artificial intelligence, and advanced models such as innervated organoids and NMJ-on-chip systems can accelerate target validation and enable personalized strategies to preserve neuromuscular function.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the effects of 12 weeks of nutrition education and combined exercise training on body composition, physical fitness, and lifestyle disease indicators in women with normal weight obesity (NWO). Twenty-six women with NWO in their 30s (BMI 18.5-22.9 kg/m2, body fat ≥ 30%) were randomly assigned to either a diet education and exercise training group (DE+TR; n = 13) or a diet education only group (DE; n = 13). The DE+TR group performed 80 minutes of combined exercise (40 min aerobic + 40 min resistance) three days per week for 12 weeks with nutrition education. The DE group received nutrition education only. Body composition, physical fitness, and lifestyle disease indicators were measured pre- and post-intervention using two-way repeated measures ANOVA. Body fat mass and body fat percentage decreased significantly in both groups, while fat-free mass increased only in the DE+TR group (p < .05). Physical fitness parameters (grip strength, sit-ups, flexibility, standing long jump, VO2max) and all 1-RM tests improved significantly only in the DE+TR group. Lifestyle disease indicators improved significantly in the DE+TR group: hypertension markers (heart rate, systolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, rate pressure product), diabetes markers (fasting glucose, insulin, HOMA-IR), lipid profiles (total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL-C, HDL-C), and atherosclerosis risk ratios all showed favorable changes (p < .05). Twelve weeks of combined nutrition education and exercise training effectively improves body composition, physical fitness, and lifestyle disease indicators in women with NWO, providing more comprehensive health benefits than nutrition education alone. From a public health perspective, these findings support the implementation of combined exercise-nutrition programs in community health centers and workplace wellness programs for women identified with NWO.",

    "abstract": "Bariatric surgery (BS) is an effective intervention for morbid obesity; however, it is often accompanied by undesirable muscle mass loss, which can negatively affect metabolic function and physical performance. Probiotics and resistance training have been studied discretely to address this complication. The present randomized controlled trial investigated the independent and combined effects of probiotic-enriched yogurt and resistance training on muscle preservation and related health outcomes in post-BS patients. In this parallel, randomized controlled trial, 52 participants who had recently undergone BS and met the eligibility criteria were randomly assigned to one of four groups: group A (probiotic-enriched yogurt plus resistance training [FY+RT]), group B (probiotic-enriched yogurt [FY]), group C (resistance training [RT]), and group D (control), with 13 participants in each group. Anthropometric indices, body composition, functional performance, inflammatory and oxidative stress markers, lipid profile, and liver enzymes were measured at baseline and after a 12-week intervention. All participants completed the intervention. The FY+RT group showed the greatest preservation of muscle mass, with the smallest reductions in fat-free mass percentage (-2.32%,  The combination of probiotic-enriched yogurt and resistance training was the most effective strategy for preserving muscle mass and improving strength following BS. Further research is warranted to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and validate these findings.",

Effects of kinetic- and kinematic-oriented change-of-direction training on anterior cruciate ligament risk factors in elite soccer players under fatigue. J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2026-This study investigated the effects of repeated change-of-direction (COD) drills on body composition and performance outcomes in elite U17 soccer players, examining fatigue-induced changes in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury risk mechanisms. Twenty-eight male athletes (age: 16.8 ± 0.6 years; height: 167.4 ± 2.3 cm; body mass: 63.50 ± 2.19 kg; fat mass (FM): 5.31 ± 0.90 kg; fat-free mass (FFM): 58.20 ± 0.84 kg) were randomly assigned to either a kinetic group emphasizing resistance-based force production or a kinematic group targeting agility and COD mechanics. A 12-week in-season intervention was conducted, with pretest and posttest evaluations of heart rate (HR), blood lactate (LA), rating of perceived exertion (RPE), FM, FFM, COD time, and shuttle sprint (SS) performance. Significant group × time interactions were observed for FM (F (1, 26) = 6.07, p = 0.021, η2 = 0.189), SS (F (1, 26) = 5.75, p = 0.024, η2 = 0.181), and RPE (F (1, 26) = 13.52, p = 0.001, η2 = 0.342), favoring the kinetic group. These athletes exhibited greater reductions in FM, smaller increases in sprint time, and elevated RPE, indicating improved fatigue tolerance. No interaction effects were found for COD, HR, or LA, but the kinetic group exhibited more effective within-group adaptation to training-induced fatigue. Overall, kinetic-based COD training may support neuromuscular and metabolic adaptation under fatigue, while kinematic approaches may better preserve movement quality. A combined approach may mitigate fatigue-related ACL injury risk during competition.",

    "abstract": "The combination of vitamin D supplementation and exercise has gained attention for its potential to improve body composition and muscular strength. In this systematic review and meta-analysis we aimed to determine whether combining vitamin D supplementation with exercise is more effective than exercise alone in improving body composition and muscular strength in adults. We systematically searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus up to April 1, 2024. Studies evaluating vitamin D supplementation combined with exercise versus exercise-only controls were included. Outcomes assessed were 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], body weight (BW), body mass index (BMI), fat mass (FM), body fat percentage (BFP), fat-free mass (FFM), and muscular strength (handgrip, leg press, and knee extension). Weighted mean differences (WMDs) were calculated. Fractional polynomial modeling was used to assess nonlinear associations between vitamin D dose (IU/wk), intervention duration, and outcomes. A total of 28 studies with 1675 participants were included. Vitamin D combined with exercise significantly increased 25(OH)D levels compared to exercise alone (WMD, 34.11 nmol/L; P = .001). Subgroup analyses showed significant increases in 25(OH)D levels in both healthy and unhealthy adults. No significant effects were observed for BW, BMI, FM, BFP, FFM, or leg press strength (all P > .05). A modest but significant improvement was found in knee extension strength (WMD, 4.36 kg; P = .039). Additionally, handgrip strength improved significantly in older adults and in those receiving higher vitamin D doses. Vitamin D supplementation combined with exercise increases 25(OH)D levels but does not improve body composition more than exercise alone. Overall, muscular strength was not significantly affected; however, modest improvements were observed in knee extension strength and handgrip strength, particularly in older adults and those receiving higher vitamin D doses.

    "abstract": "Metabolic bariatric surgery (MBS) can lead to substantial fat-free mass loss (FFML) due to malnutrition, decreased protein intake and insufficient physical activity. Disproportional FFML has been associated with an increased risk for adverse health outcomes. Resistance training (RT) combined with protein intake contributes to maintenance and increase of fat-free mass (FFM) in healthy individuals. However, it is unclear whether RT and protein supplementation can prevent FFML after MBS. In the EffectiveNess of pRotein supplementatIon Combined witH resistance Exercise training to counteract Disproportional fat-free mass loss following metabolic bariatric surgery (ENRICHED) randomised controlled trial, 400 patients scheduled to undergo MBS will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to the ENRICHED perioperative care programme (intervention group) or the standard perioperative care programme of the Dutch Obesity Clinic (control group). The study is currently recruiting participants at two centres in the Netherlands: Nieuwegein and Amsterdam. The postoperative standard programme consists of 13 group sessions spread over a period of 18 months. As part of the ENRICHED programme, RT and protein supplementation will be added 3 weeks after MBS. Additional whole-body RT consists of home-based training sessions two to three times a week, and supervised RT sessions of 45-60 min once weekly, performed at 60-75% of one-repetition maximum (1-RM). Protein supplementation will start by adding 20 g of whey protein to the daily intake. The supplementation will be gradually increased with 20 g every 4 weeks until a total of 60 g whey protein a day is reached. After 12 weeks of protein supplementation, the focus shifts towards incorporating protein-rich food products into the daily dietary intake. The primary endpoint is the prevalence of disproportional FFM loss, defined as FFML/total weight loss ≥30%, at 3 months post-MBS. Secondary endpoints are differences in body composition, muscle strength and function, cardiorespiratory fitness, (cardio)metabolic health, health-related quality of life, gastrointestinal discomfort, cost-effectiveness of the intervention and treatment satisfaction. Outcomes will be assessed preoperatively and at 3, 6 and 12 months postoperatively. The study protocol V.2.0 was approved by the Medical Research Ethics Committee Oost-Nederland (NL-OMON57119) on 9 April 2025. All participants will provide written informed consent prior to enrolment. Study findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations.

    "abstract": "This study compared the effects of a 4-week in-season strength-training intervention using a functional electromechanical dynamometer (FEMD) versus a free-weight pulley-based (FWPB) system on throwing velocity, strength, and body composition in semiprofessional male handball players. Seventeen male handball players were randomly assigned to either an FEMD group (n = 8) or an FWPB group (n = 9) and completed a 4-week in-season strength-training program. Preintervention and postintervention assessments included throwing velocity (jumping and standing), isometric and dynamic strength using 2 different resistance devices, and body composition. A 2-way repeated-measures analysis of variance (time × group interaction) was used to assess the effects of the intervention. No significant time × group interaction effects were observed for most outcomes (P > .05), indicating similar overall training adaptations. Both methodologies improved standing throwing velocity (time: P < .001, ηp2 = .621), although the FWPB group demonstrated a significantly higher overall jumping throwing velocity (P = .025, ηp2 = .293). Similarly, FEMD and FWPB training both improved various FEMD-based strength variables (P < .036, ηp2 > .261) and most pulley-based strength variables (P < .001), with FWPB showing additional specific gains in certain strength and power parameters (P < .05). Additionally, both groups showed overall increases in soft lean mass (P = .002, ηp2 = .494), with FWPB demonstrating a significant improvement (P = .043), while body-fat percentage remained unchanged. Both FEMD and FWPB strength-training methods improved neuromuscular performance and body composition in handball players during the competitive season, with no clear superiority of either modality. Despite the short duration, the results highlight the relevance of in-season strength training for maintaining and enhancing physical capacities including throwing velocity in handball players.",

    "abstract": "Creatine (Cr) supplementation is well established for enhancing fat-free mass (FFM) when combined with resistance training (RT). However, the influence of prior training experience on supplementation efficacy remains unknown. This systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of controlled trials evaluated the effects of Cr supplementation combined with RT on body composition, with particular emphasis on the differences between trained (experienced) and untrained (novice) individuals. A systematic search of major databases was conducted to identify controlled trials published until March 2025. The effects of Cr supplementation on body mass, body mass index (BMI), FFM, fat mass (FM), and body fat percentage (BFP) were examined using random-effects meta-analysis. A pooled analysis of 61 trials revealed that Cr supplementation significantly increased FFM (weighted mean difference [WMD]: 1.39 kg; 95% confidence intereval (CI): 1.07,1.70;  Both novice and experienced lifters gained FFM with Cr supplementation compared to placebo. The increase in FFM was approximately 0.6 kg (≈50%) greater in experienced participants; however, this between-group difference was not statistically significant.",

Aerobic PA (30 - 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous intensity most days of the week) can be considered for adults who want to: a. achieve small amounts of body weight and fat loss (Level 2a, Grade B) b. achieve reductions in abdominal visceral fat (Level 1a, Grade A) and ectopic fat such as liver and heart fat (Level 1a, Grade A),even in the absence of weight loss c. favour weight maintenance after weight loss (Level 2a, Grade B) d. favour the maintenance of fat-free mass during weight loss (Level 2a, Grade B) e. increase cardiorespiratory fitness (Level 2a, Grade B)[9] and mobility (Level 2a, Grade B). 2. For adults living with overweight or obesity, resistance training may promote weight maintenance or modest increases in muscle mass or fat-free mass and mobility (Level 2a, Grade B) 3. Increasing exercise intensity, including high-intensity interval training (HIIT), can achieve greater increases in cardiorespiratory fitness compared with moderate-intensity aerobic activity, and reduce the amount of time required to achieve similar benefits (Level 2a, Grade B). 4. Regular PA, with and without weight loss, can improve many cardiometabolic risk factors in adults who have overweight or obesity, including: a. hyperglycaemia and insulin sensitivity (Level 2b, Grade B) b. high blood pressure (Level 1a, Grade B) c. dyslipidaemia (Level 2a, Grade B). 5. Regular PA can improve health-related quality of life, mood disorders (i.e. depression, anxiety) and body image in adults with overweight or obesity (Level 2b, Grade B).",

    "abstract": "Exercise training is a cornerstone in managing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), yet direct comparisons between combined aerobic-resistance training (A + R) and high-intensity interval training (HIIT) across clinical and patient-reported outcomes remain limited. To compare the effects of A + R and HIIT on insulin resistance, glycaemic control, body composition, physical function, and quality of life in adults with T2DM, relative to standard care. A single-centre, randomised controlled trial involving 90 participants with T2DM (aged 30-65 years), allocated to A + R, HIIT, or control groups. A + R consisted of moderate-intensity aerobic and resistance exercises, while HIIT comprised structured interval sessions. Both programs were delivered 3-5 times weekly for 12 weeks. The control group received usual care without structured exercise. Primary outcomes included fasting insulin (FI), Glycosylated Hemoglobin (HbA1c), and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). Secondary outcomes included fasting glucose (FG), 6-minute walk distance (6MWD), subcutaneous and visceral fat, muscle mass, and WHOQOL-BREF domains. Compared with control, the HIIT group showed a greater reduction in fasting glucose (Mean Difference [MD] -29.1 mg/dL; 95% CI -41.2 to -17.0) and the A+R group also improved (MD -20.6 mg/dL; 95% CI -31.0 to -10.2). HbA1c was lower versus control in both HIIT (MD -3.35%; 95% CI -4.11 to -2.58) and A+R (MD -3.33%; 95% CI -4.03 to -2.62). Fasting insulin decreased relative to control in HIIT (MD -7.16 mIU/L; 95% CI -10.04 to -4.28) and A+R (MD -8.87 mIU/L; 95% CI -11.77 to -5.97). HOMA-IR improved versus control in A+R (MD -2.33; 95% CI -3.63 to -1.03) with a non-significant trend in HIIT (MD -1.17; 95% CI -2.47 to 0.13). Functional capacity (6-minute walk distance) increased versus control in HIIT (MD +178.9 m; 95% CI 130.5 to 227.4) and A+R (MD +233.6 m; 95% CI 191.8 to 275.5). Body composition favored both interventions: fat-free mass increased (HIIT MD +7.54 kg; 95% CI 4.71 to 10.36; A+R MD +5.96 kg; 95% CI 3.06 to 8.86) while subcutaneous fat (HIIT MD -7.16%; 95% CI -9.33 to -4.99; A+R MD -8.37%; 95% CI -10.65 to -6.09) and visceral fat (HIIT MD -4.70%; 95% CI -5.93 to -3.47; A+R MD -4.58%; 95% CI -5.86 to -3.31) were reduced. Quality of life improved across domains versus control in both groups (e.g., physical domain: HIIT MD +10.29; 95% CI 4.06 to 16.51; A+R MD +13.77; 95% CI 6.62 to 20.91). All results were derived from covariate-adjusted mixed models with multiple comparison corrections (Benjamini-Hochberg FDR, q = 0.05; Bonferroni-adjusted α = 0.002). Findings are limited to adherent participants, and generalizability is restricted to those without advanced complications. The 12-week duration precludes assessment of long-term sustainability. Both HIIT and A+R significantly improved metabolic, functional, and psychosocial outcomes compared with control. HIIT yielded greater benefits for fasting glucose and muscle mass, while A+R conferred broader improvements in HbA1c, fat reduction, and quality of life. These findings support tailoring exercise prescriptions to therapeutic goals and highlight the complementary roles of HIIT and A+R in routine diabetes care. The trial is registered with the Clinical Trial Registry of India (reference no: CTRI/2022/04/041762).",

    "abstract": "Fasting has been used as a strategy to promote reduction in body fat and enhance adaptations to physical training, but there is no consensus in the literature regarding the effects of resistance training when sessions are performed while fasting. The aim was to systematically review the effects of resistance training performed in the fasted state on body composition and physical performance. We included clinical trials that comparing resistance training performed in fasted state versus fed state on fat free mass, body fat mass, muscle hypertrophy and strength in adults. The search was performed using databases, gray literature and manual search. Methodological quality was assessed using the risk of bias tool for randomized trials. The pooled effect estimates were computed from the standardized mean difference and the 95 % confidence interval using random effects models. Four studies were included, three of which were assessed as having high risk of bias. No significant differences were found between fasted and fed states in fat free mass (SMD: 0.529; 95 % CI: -0.801 to 1.859; p = 0.436), muscle hypertrophy (SMD: 0.645; 95 % CI: -0.753 to 2.042; p = 0.366), or strength (SMD: 0.415; 95 % CI: -0.399 to 1.228; p = 0.318). However, the fasted state was associated with greater changes in body fat mass (SMD: -1.001; 95 % CI: -1.970 to -0.032; p = 0.043). Resistance training performed in fasted and fed states appears to have similar effects on body composition, muscle hypertrophy and strength, particularly when sessions follow an overnight fast.",

MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, CENTRAL, and MedRxiv were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from inception up to July 1, 2025. RCTs published in English comparing exercise to controls (CON) or to another exercise type in CRC patients after colon resection surgery were qualified. Thirty-two studies involving 2,001 CRC survivors (51.3/48.7 male-female ratio; mean ± SD: age, 58.0 ± 10.2 years; BMI, 27.1 ± 3.9 kg·m -2) were included. HIIT and CT were more effective than CON in improving cardiorespiratory fitness and fasting insulin, respectively. No exercise type was identified as being more efficacious than CON in improving any other outcome measures. Nevertheless, HIIT had the highest probability of being the best exercise intervention for improving body weight, physical activity, cardiorespiratory fitness, and quality of life. AT had the highest likelihood of reducing body mass index, fasting glucose, and anxiety. CT had the highest probability of improving fasting insulin, fatigue, depression, and exercise adherence, while RT showed the highest probability of being the most effective exercise type in increasing handgrip strength and fat-free mass. The current evidence indicates few confirmed benefits of exercise in CRC survivors, suggesting which types of exercise are most promising for a given psychophysiological outcome and may inform further large-scale RCTs of high methodological quality.",

    "title": "Is Ultrasound an Accurate Method for Predicting Fat-Free Mass in Resistance-Trained Men?",
    "abstract": "Increasing muscle mass is the main objective of individuals engaged in resistance training (RT) programs. Traditional imaging techniques such as computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) are commonly used to quantify fat-free mass (FFM), but their high cost, limited accessibility and technical complexity often restrict their routine use. Ultrasound (US), by contrast, offers a non-invasive, portable and cost-effective alternative and therefore can play an important role in monitoring musculoskeletal adaptations because it provides objective measures of muscle mass and muscle quality. Since the literature does not provide an adequate US-based model to estimate whole-body (WB) and appendicular FFM in resistance-trained adult men, we aimed to develop and validate a US-based equation to predict WB and thigh FFM in resistance-trained men. Seventy-nine men (31.4 ± 7.0 y, 76.3 ± 10.2 kg, 174.3 ± 6.0 cm) with prior RT experience underwent DXA assessments to calculate WB and thigh FFM. Vastus lateralis (VL) and rectus femoris (RF) muscle thickness (MT) were assessed at rest by B-mode US imaging. Stepwise regression analysis was performed to develop US-based equations, and the developed models were cross-validated using the PRESS approach. VL and RF MT directly correlated with body mass and WB and thigh FFM. Regression analysis showed that RF-MT alone explains 18.9% and 19% of the WB and thigh-FFM, respectively, while VL-MT alone explains 26.5% and 20.1% of the WB and thigh-FFM, respectively. Four models were developed (two for WB and two for thigh-FFM, each based on either VL or RF values), with the best performance being observed for the VL approach: WB-FFM (kg)R The present study introduces a statistically robust and ecologically applicable mathematical model based on US measurements, specifically on the VL-MT, for assessing FFM in resistance-trained men. This model may also be valuable for detecting muscle asymmetries and monitoring adaptations to training and rehabilitation programs.",

    "abstract": "To address the limited evidence on the independent and combined roles of cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and muscle strength by investigating their association with incident chronic kidney disease (CKD) in a large UK Biobank population. This prospective cohort included 417,225 participants without baseline CKD who had complete muscle strength data, and 63,211 participants with CRF data. Muscle strength was measured by grip strength normalized to fat-free mass. Cardiorespiratory fitness was estimated via a submaximal stationary bike test, calculating maximal oxygen consumption in metabolic equivalents. Incident CKD was identified using hospital records, primary care data, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (<60 mL/min per 1.73 m Over mean follow-ups of 13.2 and 12.1 years, 1946 and 15,100 participants developed CKD in the cohort of CRF and muscle strength, respectively. Both higher CRF and higher muscle strength independently correlated with reduced CKD risk. Cardiorespiratory fitness exhibited a linear inverse relationship, whereas muscle strength followed a nonlinear pattern with a threshold around 0.6 kg/kg, beyond which further increases in grip strength normalized to fat-free mass did not significantly enhance the protective effect. Participants with high levels of both CRF and muscle strength experienced the greatest risk reduction. Higher CRF and muscle strength each confer protection against CKD, with combined enhancement offering optimal benefit. Integrating aerobic and resistance training may substantially aid CKD prevention efforts.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) leads to substantial muscle mass loss. Resistance training (RT) is an effective strategy to maintain muscle mass. This study aimed to gain insight into the motivators, barriers, and preferences that are correlated with RT uptake after MBS. A digital survey assessing RT was sent to patients who had MBS 1-18 months prior. Patient characteristics were extracted from electronic health records. Motivators, barriers, and preferences were assessed with a questionnaire and compared across three groups: patients currently engaged in RT (RT-group), previously engaged in RT (ex-RT), or never engaged in RT (non-RT). Among 1,609 participants (77% female, 47 ± 11 years old, BMI 42 ± 5 kg/m2), 68% were classified as RT-group, 11% as ex-RT, and 21% as non-RT. The RT-group reported improving fitness (78% vs. 67%), mental health (65% vs. 43%), and overall health (63% vs. 41%) more often as motivators for RT than the ex-RT. RT barriers were comparable between ex-RT and non-RT, most frequently lack of motivation (37% vs. 40%), time (33% vs. 28%), enjoyment (29% vs. 29%), and physical complaints (39% vs. 37%). Ex-RT and non-RT reported a preferred exercise frequency of 2 sessions/week with 30 min/session, in their home setting with a training schedule and guidance from a professional. The majority of participants in our study engaged in RT. We identified improving overall fitness and limiting strength or muscle loss as motivators, lack of motivation, physical complaints, lack of time and enjoyment as barriers, and professional guidance and a training schedule for RT at home as facilitators, which were correlated to RT uptake after MBS.",

We developed an inpatient geriatric rehabilitation program for patients with severe COPD and malnutrition and demonstrated its feasibility. The aim of the current study was to explore its preliminary effects. A prospective case series was conducted, including a total of eight patients with severe COPD and low fat-free muscle mass index (FFMi). Our 6-10 weeks program consisted of anaerobic resistance training, based on the nonlinear periodized exercise (NLPE) principles, nutritional support, psychoeducation on physical energy management, combined with a restriction of physical activities. Overall activity level, as measured in metabolic equivalents (METs), remained consistently below 3 METs for all patients. Primary outcomes were changes body composition (FFMi, body mass index (BMI), and body weight), muscle function, and exercise performance from the start and end of the study. We used paired samples t-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test to compare pre and postscores. Body composition and muscle function showed both significant and clinically relevant improvements after discharge of the program. Exercise performance showed a clinically relevant improvement. Additionally, ADL independence and health-related quality of life were improved. The patients in the current study had a clinical improved body composition, increased personal FFMi and exercise performance despite the absence of cardio-training and restrictions in functional walking distance. A cluster randomized controlled study will be necessary to show the definitive effect of the intervention.",

Although its benefits for endurance and resistance training are well documented, its effects on body composition remain uncertain. This systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis aimed to assess the impact of CIT supplementation on anthropometric parameters. A comprehensive search of major databases identified relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published until March 2025. A random-effects model was used to synthesize the data. Twenty-one RCTs were included. Overall, CIT supplementation had no substantial effects on body mass index (BMI), body weight, fat mass (FM), waist circumference (WC), body fat percentage (BFP), and fat-free mass (FFM). Subgroup analyses revealed reductions in FM among participants over 40 years of age and in those administered more than 6 g/day of CIT. Interventions lasting 3 to 8 weeks were associated with a significant increase in FFM. Dose-response analyses suggested a non-linear association between CIT supplementation duration and changes in FM and FFM. CIT supplementation appears to have no overall effect on body composition. However, exploratory findings indicated potential benefits at higher doses or shorter durations. Rigorous trials controlling for dietary intake and training variables are needed to clarify its long-term effects.",

    "abstract": "Brugada syndrome (BrS) has been associated with lower obesity rates and reduced body mass index (BMI) in observational studies. This Mendelian randomization (MR) study investigates causal effects of anthropometric traits on the risk of BrS. Two-sample MR analyses were conducted using publicly available genome-wide association study summary statistics, and both discovery and replication datasets were incorporated. The inverse-variance weighted method was the primary analytical approach, supported by MR-Egger and weighted median methods. Sensitivity analyses (including Cochran Q test, MR-Egger intercept test, MR-PRESSO global test, and leave-one-out analysis) were performed to assess the robustness of the results. Genetically predicted comparative body size at age 10 showed significant inverse associations with BrS risk (discovery: odds ratio [OR] = 0.40, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.26-0.61, P = 2.07 × 10-5; replication: OR = 0.47, 95% CI: 0.31-0.71, P = 3.68 × 10-4). Similarly, adult obesity was inversely associated with BrS in the discovery set (OR = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.69-0.89, P = 1.42 × 10-4). Genetically predicted childhood obesity, whole-body fat-free mass, BMI, waist-to-hip ratio, and basal metabolic rate also demonstrated potential protective effects (discovery: all P < .05). Reverse MR analysis revealed positive associations between genetically predicted BrS and both waist and hip circumference (P < .005). This study suggests that genetically higher childhood/adult obesity and increased fat-free mass may reduce the risk of BrS. Maintaining a BMI in the upper-normal range and enhancing fat-free mass through resistance training may represent a viable strategy to mitigate BrS risk.",

This study aimed to address this gap through a network meta-analysis (NMA) to evaluate the impact of various exercise modalities on health status in children and adolescents with overweight and obesity. Two researchers (XC and KD) systematically searched databases including PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase and others for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published up to May 2024. The studies analyzed the effects of exercise interventions on body composition, lipid profiles, glucose metabolism, and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) in children and adolescents with overweight and obesity. Study quality was assessed using the Cochrane tools, and the random-effects NMA was conducted within a Bayesian framework. A total of 51 studies with 2263 participants were included, covering four exercise modalities: aerobic exercise (AE), resistance exercise (RE), combined exercise (CE), and high-intensity interval training (HIIT). HIIT was relatively more effective for improving CRF, including oxygen uptake peak (VO HIIT is the relatively effective modality for enhancing CRF, while AE and CE are notably effective for improving body composition. RE is regarded as a preferable choice for lipid regulation, and CE tends to provide superior outcomes for glucose and insulin control. These findings provide comparative evidence for clinical and policy recommendations, though further high-quality research is needed for validation.",

Seven hundred and thirty adolescents with obesity (mean age: 14.6 ± 2.1 years, BMI > 97th percentile for gender and age) were included in this study.

    "title": "Effect of a 16-Week Exercise Program After Bariatric Surgery on Sarcopenia Parameters Based on FNIH, EWGSOP2, and EASO/ESPEN Criteria: the Results of the EXPOBAR Randomized Trial Program.",
    "abstract": "Bariatric surgery is a recognized treatment option for severe obesity, and its effectiveness in reducing weight and controlling obesity-related conditions has been demonstrated. However, it can also lead to decreased skeletal muscle mass and strength, increasing the risk of sarcopenia after surgery. This randomized clinical trial studied the effects of a 16-week exercise program on sarcopenia in bariatric surgery patients. Thirty-seven surgery candidates participated in the EXPOBAR (EXercise POst BARiatric) program and were randomized into experimental or control groups. The intervention lasted 16 weeks, starting 1 month after surgery, and included a circuit training with aerobic and resistance exercise intervention. The outcomes included physical fitness parameters (anthropometry, body composition, and physical performance) and were assessed at four time points. All participants underwent gastric bypass surgery (RYGB). The EXPOBAR trial revealed significant and meaningful effects of the exercise intervention on anthropometric indices, such as weight (p = 0.039) and waist circumference (p = 0.010). The most substantial improvements were observed in physical function and strength metrics (p = 0.005 and p < 0.001, respectively), along with a reduction in fat mass (p = 0.006), indicating the intervention's effectiveness on sarcopenia parameters and in enhancing both physical fitness and body composition. Current findings indicate that following an initial decrease due to bariatric surgery, exercise training significantly improves functional physical capacity and strength. The exercise program in this study effectively reversed the surgery-induced loss in function and strength, reducing the number of patients at risk of sarcopenia. Physical and functional capacity are crucial noninvasive indicators for diagnosing muscle quality and sarcopenia. Long-term management of sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity in bariatric surgery patients requires frequent monitoring of body composition and muscle function. This approach is essential for tracking progress and optimizing treatment strategies over time. This study highlights the importance of integrating structured exercise programs into after bariatric surgery care to mitigate the risk of sarcopenia. The trial was registered at Clinicaltrials.gov (NCT05289219).",

    "abstract": "Time-restricted eating (TRE), a subtype of intermittent fasting, has gained significant popularity in recent years. This dietary approach, when combined with resistance training (RT), has demonstrated potential benefits for body composition and physiological parameters. This study aimed to investigate the effects of TRE and high-protein consumption on visceral adipose tissue (VAT), subcutaneous adipose tissue, leptin, and ghrelin levels in young women with overweight engaged in RT. Thirty-two women with overweight (body mass index 25-30 kg/m2), aged 18-30 years, were randomly assigned to four groups: TRE with high protein (THP), TRE with regular protein, high protein only (HP), and regular protein only. All participants underwent RT and adhered to a 25% calorie-restricted diet. The high-protein groups received 1.6 g·kg-1·day-1 of protein. Body composition, blood biomarkers, and muscle functions were assessed. Significant reductions in VAT (p < .001) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (p < .001) were observed across all groups, with the THP group exhibiting the greatest decrease in VAT (Δ = -146.98 ± 12.66, d = -1.867). Leptin levels also showed a significant decrease in all groups (p < .001). However, significant differences in leptin reduction were detected only between THP versus regular protein only (p = .045) and TRE with regular protein versus regular protein only (p = .034) groups. Plasma ghrelin levels remained unchanged across all groups. Notably, the high-protein groups (THP and high protein only) demonstrated a significant increase in fat-free mass (Δ THP = 1.06 ± 1.75, Δ HP = 2.37 ± 0.64). An 8-week program combining TRE, high-protein intake, and RT effectively reduced VAT, subcutaneous adipose tissue, and leptin levels while preserving muscle mass in women with overweight. This intervention did not significantly alter plasma ghrelin levels.",

    "abstract": "Phytosteroids like 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) and diosgenin (DSG) have shown promising anabolic and performance-enhancing effects in in vitro, animal, and human studies. Combining phytosteroids is common in supplements, with early in vitro research suggesting additive effects via distinct signaling pathways. However, human studies on the combined effects of 20E and DSG are lacking. This study aimed to evaluate the anabolic and performance-enhancing potential of a commercially available 20E and DSG supplement. Twenty-eight resistance-trained young men were recruited for this study. Participants were randomized into two groups: a 20E and DSG (EcDi) group, and a placebo (Plac) group. Both groups performed free-weight resistance training three times per week for 12 weeks. The EcDi group received a commercially available phytosteroid product three times a day (as recommended on the label), while the Plac group received a placebo product. Assessments were conducted at four time points (T0, T1 [4 weeks], T2 [8 weeks], T3 [12 weeks]) and included measurements of one-repetition maximum (1-RM) for the squat (SQ) and bench press (BP) exercises, as well as body weight (BW), fat-free mass (FFM), muscle mass (MM), fat mass (FM), and muscle thickness of the pectoralis major (PM) and the proximal, middle and distal regions of the anterior (i.e.  Twenty-four participants completed the study successfully. Significant improvements in 1-RM SQ and BP were observed across both groups, indicating a time but no specific group effect. Similarly, significant time effects without group effects were found for FFM, MM, FM and muscle thickness (anterior quadriceps femoris at 30%, lateral quadriceps femoris at 50% and PM). Subsequent analyses of the supplement revealed that less than 1% of the claimed 20E concentration and 10.4% of the claimed DSG concentration were present in the capsules. In addition, no biological activity or hypertrophic effects were detected in the C2C12 cells. This study demonstrated that the prescribed resistance training protocol resulted in significant anabolic and performance-enhancing effects that did not differ between groups. The lack of group-specific differences suggests that the tested phytosteroid supplement did not provide additional benefits. The significant discrepancy between the claimed and actual 20E and DSG concentration resulted in the lack of biological activity in C2C12 cells and likely contributed to the absence of measurable group-specific effects. To enhance the reliability of future phytosteroid research, we strongly recommend: (1) verification of active compound concentrations in supplements, its actual content and absence of potential contamination with prohibited substances, (2) confirmation of their biological activity using ",

A thorough literature review was performed on PubMed. Our search yielded 196 articles. We included eight studies that dealt with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) patients who met our inclusion criteria and consisted of randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses. This review article found that resistance exercise increased muscle mass and reduced fat mass in T1DM patients. Increasing the duration and intensity of physical activity led to an increase in fat-free mass. Parental support among type 1 diabetic children showed positive attitudes towards a healthy lifestyle. Addressing stigma among adolescents with T1DM is important, and personal and community knowledge about the condition can help facilitate physical activity participation. Collaboration between healthcare providers, families, and peers is essential in managing physical activity in T1DM patients. Having a staff member with specific training to provide physical activity advice can benefit diabetes teams. Further research over a longer duration is necessary to confirm these outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Obesity continues to grow as a public health concern and although dietary interventions can be effective at reducing body mass and improving cardiovascular risk factors, they also result in undesirable losses of lean tissue. The aim of this randomised controlled pilot trial was to investigate the effects of a home-based resistance training exercise programme on body composition and muscle function in people living with overweight or obesity undergoing dietary weight loss. Participants (n = 48) from Glasgow were randomly assigned to either a diet-induced weight loss group (WL) or a diet plus home-based resistance training exercise group (RT + WL) for 12-weeks. Body composition, muscle strength, and physical function were assessed at baseline and post-intervention. There was no effect of the resistance exercise training programme (all p > 0.05) on body composition including body mass index, total body mass, fat mass, fat free mass or muscle thickness during weight loss. However, the resistance training group showed improvements in muscle and physical function compared to the weight loss only group, resulting in higher grip strength (RT + WL: Δ2.65, 95% CI: 0.44, 4.86; WL: Δ-0.26, 95% CI: -2.04, 1.51:p = 0.046), maximal voluntary contraction force (RT + WL:Δ23.61, 95% CI: 3.39, 43.84 WL: Δ-11.95, 95% CI: -35.37, 11.48;p = 0.019), and sit-to-stand test scores (RT + WL:Δ5.9, 95% CI: 4.27, 7.53 WL: Δ1.47, 95% CI: 0.13, 2.82; p < 0.001). These findings suggest that incorporating home-based resistance training into weight loss programmes can preserve, or even enhance, muscle function without negatively impacting the effectiveness of dietary weight loss interventions, highlighting its potential to mitigate muscle function losses during weight loss in people living with overweight or obese.

    "title": "Creatine Supplementation in Combat Sport Athletes: A Narrative Systematic Review.",
    "abstract": "Creatine is a widely studied ergogenic aid known for its effects on muscle performance and body composition. However, its impact or utility for athletes involved in combat sports, who often aim to reduce body mass to meet a specific weight class, remains unclear. To conduct a narrative systematic review of peer-reviewed published studies that examined the effects of creatine supplementation on body mass, body composition, muscular strength, power, endurance, fatigue, recovery, and cognitive performance in combat sport athletes. A comprehensive search was conducted in multiple public databases up to March 2025. Databases searched included PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. Studies evaluating creatine supplementation in combat sports (eg wrestling, judo, taekwondo, boxing) were included. Outcomes assessed included changes in body mass and body composition, performance metrics, and markers of fatigue and recovery. Nineteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Creatine supplementation increased body mass, especially during longer-term interventions (≥6 wk) or when combined with structured resistance training. Creatine supplementation also increased measures of body mass and fat-free mass (FFM). Muscular power and maximal strength outcomes improved significantly after creatine supplementation, particularly in studies utilizing short-duration, high-intensity exercise protocols. Creatine supplementation did not influence measures of sport-specific endurance, recovery or fatigue. No serious adverse effects were reported across studies for creatine supplementation. Creatine supplementation enhances body mass, FFM, muscle strength and power in combat sport athletes. Given its safety and efficacy profile, creatine supplementation remains a promising supplement for supporting some aspects of athletic performance in combat sports.",

Optimizing resistance training outcomes: comparing in-person supervision, online coaching, and self-guided approaches: a randomized controlled trial. J Strength Cond Res 39(11): 1129-1137, 2025-This randomized, parallel-group trial investigated the effects of supervised (SUP), app-guided (APP), and self-guided (PDF) 10-week, thrice-weekly full-body resistance training (RT) on strength, body composition, well-being, and supervision satisfaction (S-SRQ) in trained men and women ( n = 79, 48% women; 30.7 ± 7.8 years, 1.75 ± 0.1 m, 77.5 ± 17.5 kg). Adherence was highest in SUP (88.2%), followed by APP (81.2%) and PDF (52.2%). At p ≤ 0.05, body mass (+1.8 ± 1.9 kg, p = 0.006) and fat-free mass (+1.4 ± 0.9 kg, p ≤ 0.001) increased significantly in SUP. Muscle mass gains were observed in SUP (+1.4 ± 0.9 kg, p = 0.009) and PDF (+0.9 ± 1.3 kg, p = 0.047). All groups improved squat 1-repetition maximum (1RM) (SUP: +26.6 ± 6.5 kg, p ≤ 0.001; APP: +19.2 ± 11.0 kg, p ≤ 0.001; PDF: +19.4 ± 11.7 kg, p ≤ 0.001) and bench press 1RM (SUP: +9.1 ± 3.5 kg, p ≤ 0.001; APP: +8.2 ± 4.0 kg, p ≤ 0.001; PDF: +7.7 ± 5.8 kg, p ≤ 0.001). Supervised showed significantly greater squat gains than APP and PDF ( p ≤ 0.044). Well-being (WHO-5) improved in SUP (+15.7 ± 16.2 points, p ≤ 0.001) and PDF (+9.0 ± 20.4 points, p = 0.032). Satisfaction with supervision was significantly higher in SUP (96.7 ± 4.3%) than in APP (92.0 ± 7.1%, p = 0.005). In conclusion, supervised RT resulted in superior improvements in strength, body composition, well-being, and supervision satisfaction compared with app-guided or self-guided training. Although APP and PDF resulted in some positive effects, their magnitude was generally smaller. These findings underscore the value of in-person coaching in optimizing RT outcomes. However, app-based RT shows promise for maintaining adherence, offering a viable alternative when full supervision is not feasible.",

    "abstract": "The effects of moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) on muscle hypertrophy remain controversial, largely due to the absence of non-exercise control groups in several trials and considerable heterogeneity in training protocols, assessment methods, and participant characteristics. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to examine the effects of MICT on skeletal muscle hypertrophy. Following PRISMA guidelines, searches were conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library for chronic human interventions comparing MICT to non-exercise controls, reporting both whole-body and localized muscle mass outcomes (lower limb lean mass, muscle cross-sectional area, fiber cross-sectional area, and muscle thickness) in healthy adults without chronic diseases or musculoskeletal injuries. A random-effects model compared MICT versus control for total and regional muscle mass outcomes combined and separately. Thirteen studies met the inclusion criteria. The standardized mean difference was 0.050 (95% CI: -0.147 to 0.248) for total and regional outcomes combined and 0.080 (95% CI: -0.277 to 0.437) for regional outcomes alone. In conclusion, the current evidence does not consistently support a hypertrophic effect of MICT. However, this conclusion should be interpreted with caution due to variability in study design, populations, and measurement sensitivity.",

    "abstract": "The aim is to investigate whether integrating a therapeutic program, focused on concurrent training combined with neuromuscular exercises (CNET), within a multidisciplinary approach can positively impact body composition, muscular fitness, and quality of life in adults with obesity compared with a single-mode intervention. Three-arm randomized controlled trial design. Ninety-one outpatients (54.7 [7.6] y) were randomly assigned into CNET, resistance training, or aerobic training groups. The interventions lasted 10 weeks with a frequency of 2 days per week. Pre-post assessments were conducted in body mass index, waist circumference, fat mass (FM%), fat-free mass, functional movement screen, modified version of the Balance Error Scoring System, handgrip strength test, handgrip strength test asymmetry, five-repetition sit-to-stand power, and quality of life (EuroQol Five-dimensional Visual Analog Scale). A significant time × group interaction, main effect of group and time were detected in all outcomes. CNET exhibited significant ameliorations compared with resistance training in functional movement screen (56%), modified version of the Balance Error Scoring System (86%), and FM% (70%), respectively. When compared with the aerobic training group, CNET showed enhancements in functional movement screen (62%), modified version of the Balance Error Scoring System (59%), five-repetition sit-to-stand power (4%), handgrip strength test (73%), handgrip strength test asymmetry (99%), FM% (60%), and fat-free mass (84%). Finally, resistance training outperformed aerobic training only in five-repetition sit-to-stand power (24%), handgrip strength test (73%), FM% (32%), and fat-free mass (79%) outcomes. CNET showed positive responses across all measured outcomes over 10 weeks compared to the other interventions, except for body mass index, waist circumference, and EuroQol Five-dimensional Visual Analog Scale. This exercise mode could be a feasible option to adopt when prescribing physical exercise to counteract obesity.",

    "abstract": "This systematic review and meta-analysis compared the differential effects of resistance training (RT), aerobic training (AT), and concurrent training (CT) on body mass and body fat loss in metabolically healthy individuals. A systematic search of PubMed, SportDiscus, and Web of Science databases for randomized controlled trials published between January 1980 and January 2023, comparing RT, AT, and CT in healthy adults was conducted. Primary outcomes of interest included changes in fat mass and body fat percentage; secondary outcomes were body mass and fat-free mass (FFM). Sub-analyses on intervention duration (< or ≥ 10 weeks), CT timing (aerobic and resistance exercises done on the same day versus different days within a week), and workload matching (equating workloads between AT, RT, and CT), were conducted. Study protocols followed PRISMA 2020 guidelines and were pre-registered on PROSPERO (CRD42023396530). In total, 36 studies with 1564 participants were included in the systematic review, with only 31 studies included in the meta-analysis due to missing data. For studies lasting at least 10 weeks, AT outperformed RT in reducing body mass (mean difference (MD) = -1.82 kg [95% CI = -2.72 to -0.93];  While there are no differences in percent body fat loss between exercise modes, AT and CT are more effective than RT alone in reducing absolute fat mass; however, RT neither improved nor impeded fat mass loss when incorporated into CT. Combining aerobic and resistance exercises on the same-day or different-day does not appear to influence the effectiveness of CT. When exercise interventions are short in duration (<10 weeks), there does not appear to be a difference in fat loss between exercise modalities. These results support the concurrent use of aerobic and resistance exercises for fat mass reduction, as well as an emphasis on workload and duration when programming exercise for fat loss.",

Acute glucose tolerance in response to lower- and higher-load resistance exercise in postmenopausal women: Contribution of aerobic capacity and body composition. J Strength Cond Res 39(6): e749-e757, 2025-Glucose tolerance (GT), fat-free mass (FFM), and V̇o2peak are known to decline after menopause. Exercise recommendations advise ageing adults to perform heavy weights and low repetitions (HWLR) resistance exercise (RE). However, the most efficient RE parameters to improve acute GT in postmenopausal women (PMW) are unclear. Our aim was to determine how acute GT is influenced by 2 RE sessions of different loads (HWLR vs. low-weight and higher repetitions, LWHR), compared with a control condition, and examine potential contributors. After measuring baseline oral glucose tolerance (OGTT), FFM (DXA), and V̇o2peak (metabolic cart), 12 PMW underwent additional OGTTs (area under the curve-AUC; 2-h glucose) after 3 randomized experimental conditions (control, HWLR, and LWHR). Session volume was defined as the total weight lifted. The Cederholm's index was calculated to derive insulin sensitivity. There was a significant effect of RE on glucose AUC (1,109 ± 234 vs. 954 ± 149 and 974 ± 194 mmol/L × 120 minutes for control, HWLR, and LWHR; p < 0.005) and 2-h glucose (8.8 ± 2.5 vs. 7.0 ± 1.6 and 7.4 ± 2.0 mmol/L for control, HWLR, and LWHR; p < 0.04) with no difference between HWLR and LWHR. A greater volume was achieved with LWHR (4,292.1 ± 1,143.4 vs. 3,888.1 ± 1,042.1 kg, p < 0.05), although it was not significantly associated with post-RE GT. Fat-free mass was significantly associated with Cederholm's index at baseline only (r = 0.6, p < 0.05). Significant correlations were also found between V̇o2peak and glucose AUC for all conditions (all r ≤ -0.6 to 0.8; p < 0.05). We conclude that HWLR and LWHR both acutely improve GT in PMW, whereas V̇o2peak may be a stronger contributor than FFM.",

    "abstract": "Weight loss is a primary goal in the treatment of obesity, but its effect on body composition - particularly fat-free mass (FFM) and skeletal muscle mass (SM) - is of increasing concern. This review examines the effects of antiobesity medications, particularly glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor analogs (GLP-1 RA), on body composition, the risk of sarcopenia, and strategies to preserve muscle mass during pharmacological weight loss. Studies have shown that while GLP-1 RA are effective in reducing fat mass, up to 40% of the total weight loss can come from FFM. However, it is important to distinguish between FFM and SM, as FFM includes nonmuscle components. Resistance training and adequate protein intake can mitigate muscle loss, but the evidence for their efficacy in the context of GLP-1 RA therapy is mixed. If these measures are insufficient to prevent and maintain muscle mass, the use of some nutrients, such as branched chain amino acids, creatine, leucine, omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin D, may be beneficial. Newer pharmacological approaches, such as bimagrumab, a human monoclonal antibody that acts by binding to the activin type II receptor II (ActRII), and other activin or myostatin inhibitors, show promise in preserving muscle mass while promoting fat loss. GLP-1 RA therapy for obesity should include resistance training, optimal protein intake and, if needed, specific nutrients and possibly pharmacological interventions to preserve muscle mass. Further research is needed to assess the long-term effects of GLP-1 RA on muscle health and to refine strategies to prevent sarcopenia in patients undergoing pharmacological weight loss.",

    "abstract": "Physical inactivity exacerbates muscle function and mass loss, increasing the risk of falls in older adults. Regular exercise can prevent muscle loss, cognitive decline, and comorbidities, potentially reducing fall risk. Given the multifactorial nature of fall risk, a comprehensive assessment is required. To investigate the effects of a 40-week intervention, including a long-term exercise program (16-weeks), detraining (8-weeks), and retraining (16-weeks), on fall risk and cognitive status in older adults with mild cognitive impairment. Participants (≥70 years old) were divided into two groups: Elastic Band Resistance Training (EBRT, n = 22) and a control group with no treatment (n = 20). Cognitive profile, body composition, muscle power, and multifactorial fall risk assessments (Timed Up-and-Go Test (TUG), Falls Efficacy Scale (FES), Fall Risk Assessment Tool (FRAT), and sensorimotor platform) were evaluated at four time points. Significant correlations between muscle power, fat-free mass, and cognitive status with fall risk assessments were observed at baseline. Both phases of the exercise intervention improved muscle power, body composition, cognitive profile, and fall risk status. The EBRT group showed significant improvements in muscle power (p ≤ 0.01), fall risk (FRAT, p ≤ 0.01), FES (p ≤ 0.05), sensorimotor performance (p ≤ 0.001), TUG (p ≤ 0.001), and cognitive status (MoCA, p ≤ 0.05). Protective effects persisted during the detraining phase. This study highlights significant improvements in fall risk assessment induced by EBRT, demonstrating its protective effects. The findings suggest that EBRT can enhance aspects related to fall risk, offering promising avenues for improving independence and quality of life in older adults prone to falls.",

    "abstract": "Sarcopenic obesity is a clinical condition characterized by the coexistence of excess adiposity and impaired muscle function, associated with heightened cardiometabolic risk and frailty. The emergence of new incretin-based obesity management medications (OMMs), which allow unprecedented weight loss, has raised concerns regarding weight loss-induced fat-free mass (FFM) reduction, including skeletal muscle mass (SMM). This review examines recent findings on the prevalence, diagnosis, and implications of sarcopenic obesity, explores the effects of weight-loss interventions on body composition and their impact on health, and discusses strategies to preserve muscle mass. Weight loss induced by incretin-based OMMs results in a variable but significant reduction in FFM. The extent to which this loss affects SMM and function remains uncertain. Nutritional strategies, particularly adequate protein intake, and structured exercise interventions, especially resistance training, play a key role in mitigating FFM loss. Digital health interventions and telemedicine-based exercise programs offer promising approaches for maintaining muscle health during weight loss. The clinical significance of FFM loss during weight reduction remains debated. Future research should refine sarcopenic obesity diagnostic criteria, assess the long-term impact of FFM/SMM reduction during intentional weight loss, and evaluate interventions that optimize body composition while preserving functional health.",

    "abstract": "Objectives When dealing with children and adolescents living with obesity, it is vital to be aware that exercise provides benefits in the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases and general well-being. The growing prevalence of childhood obesity makes it necessary to develop strategies aimed at controlling the barriers that limit the performance of exercise, which is why we designed a plan of exercise prescription through videos that could be accessible, free, and designed for exercise at home, as a complement to a multidisciplinary intervention program for lifestyle change. This study aimed to compare the effects of a video-based exercise prescription program (EPV) versus free-choice exercise (FCE) on anthropometric and metabolic indicators. Methods We conducted an open-label, randomized, controlled clinical trial. Patients aged eight to 16 years with obesity from the Child Unit of the General Hospital of Mexico were included. Forty-two participants finished the follow-up; 20 were boys, and 22 were girls. All patients were included in a multi-component program of healthy lifestyle changes and randomized to receive EPV (n=22) or FCE (n=20) for six months. Results The primary outcomes in both groups were a decrease in body mass index (BMI) (p < 0.001), a reduction in body fat mass (p < 0.001), and an increase in lean body mass (p = 0.003). Other outcomes observed were: in EPV, there was a decrease in low density lipid (LDL) (p=0.04); alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (p=0.002), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (p=0.001) and uric acid (p=0.003) and an increase in high density lipid (HDL) (p=0. 002), while in FCE there was a decrease in Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) (p=0.006), insulin (p=0.006), LDL (p=0.02), ALT (p=0.002), AST (p=0.004) and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) (p=0.025). Conclusion Both EPV and FCE exercise prescription programs, as part of a multidisciplinary intervention for childhood obesity, had favorable effects on body composition and metabolic parameters.",

Thirty-five young women were randomly assigned based on their body fat levels, using the 90th percentile of fat mass as a criterion, with a threshold set at ≥ 21 kg of fat mass for the obese group (n = 16) and < 21 kg of fat mass for the non-obese group (n = 19). Subjective sleep quality was evaluated using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) at pre and post a progressive six-week full-body resistance training (RT).

    "abstract": "Sarcopenic obesity (SO) is a condition characterized by the coexistence of age-related obesity and sarcopenia. This systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) aimed to compare the effects of different training modalities, such as aerobic training (AT), resistance training (RT), combined resistance with AT (CT), and multicomponent training (MCT) on body composition, muscle strength, and physical performance in elderly patients with SO. We electronically searched randomized controlled trials, published from inception to March 2024 in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science and Scopus. Effect estimates were presented as mean differences (MD) or Standard Mean Difference (SMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI). The comprehensive effects of all treatments were ranked by the surface under the cumulative ranking (SUCRA) probabilities. 14 trials enrolling 955 participants were included. The body fat percentage (BFP) in MCT (MD= -6.37, 95% CI: -8.67, -4.07), CT (MD = -2.08, 95% CI: -4.00, -0.16), and RT (MD = -1.85, 95% CI: -3.25, -0.44) was significantly lower than in the normal control group, with MCT showing superior effects compared to CT and RT. Furthermore, only MCT significantly improved fat-free mass (FFM; MD = 5.21, 95% CI:1.51, 8.91), as well as in body mass index (BMI; MD = 0.74, 95% CI:0.08, 1.40). In addition, handgrip strength (HGS) significantly improved under both MCT (SMD = 0.87, 95% CI: 0.19, 1.5) and RT(SMD = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.43, 1.25). The performance on the 30s chair stand test also yielded better outcomes for MCT (MD = 3.10, 95% CI: 1.33, 4 0.86), CT(MD = 2 0.50, 95% CI: 0.18, 5.18), and RT(MD = 3.91, 95% CI: 2.30, 5.52) when compared to the control group. Lastly, gait speed was enhanced by both MCT (MD = 0.35, 95% CI: 0.30, 0.41) and CT(MD = 0.14, 95% CI: 0.06, 0.21). The ranking results indicated that MCT was superior to other training modalities in enhancing body composition and gait speed. In contrast, RT appears to be more advantageous in the 30-second chair standing test and in improving HGS. MCT outperformed other training modalities in improving body composition and gait speed. RT was more beneficial for the 30-second chair standing test and enhancing HGS.

High protein diets have been shown to produce greater fat loss and retention of lean mass during periods of energy restriction (ER) in sedentary individuals with obesity, but less is known about the effects of high protein diets in trained individuals during ER. Although current recommendations for protein intake in active individuals are 1.2-1.7 g/kg, it is unclear whether higher intakes are necessary to maximize FFM retention and maximize physical performance in athletes undergoing periods of ER. Determine whether high protein intakes could maximize FFM retention and physical performance in trained individuals after a period of ER. Twenty-one college aged athletes underwent a 6-week 25% ER + 3-day full body resistance training. Participants were randomly assigned to a low (~1.2 g/kg), moderate (~1.6 g/kg) or high (~2.2 g/kg) protein intake. Baseline and post-intervention outcomes: Dual X-ray absorptiometry, isotopic water dilution, indirect calorimetry, dietary records and strength based physical testing. Significant reductions in body mass (p = 0.047) and fat mass (p = 0.04) with simultaneous increases in FFM (p = 0.037) were noted for all groups, with no protein intake effect. Significant increases in physical performance outcomes (5RM strength) were noted for most measures (p < 0.05). Current protein intake recommendations of 1.2-1.7 g/kg appear sufficient for most athletes even during periods of ER to maintain FFM and physical performance.",

A total of 100 women aged between 35 and 69 (mean 51.5 ± 9.61) years with a mean body mass index (BMI) of 27.3 (±5.4 kg/m After 18 weeks of training in both intervention groups, ANCOVA demonstrated statistically significant ( CHWIT is an effective form of training, improving body composition and physical functions in inactive pre- and postmenopausal women. Changes in the muscle component require a longer intervention of physical effort in women after menopause.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to clarify the pure synergistic effect of an adequate protein intake (1.5 g/kg body weight/day) and resistance exercise (RE) on muscle strength, body composition, and metabolic markers in sedentary adults, excluding confounders arising from excessive protein intake or impaired protein turnover. A double-blind randomized controlled trial was performed on apparently healthy sedentary adult participants (n = 34). RE was performed for 4 weeks in the placebo (PLA-EX, n = 17) and whey protein supplement groups (PRO-EX, n = 17). Body composition, isokinetic muscular function, resting metabolic rate, blood biochemical variables, and liver ultrasound findings were analyzed and compared before and after the intervention. Both the PLA-EX and PRO-EX groups experienced significantly reduced body weight (PLA-EX, p < 0.001; PRO-EX, p < 0.01), body mass index (PLA-EX, p < 0.01; PRO-EX, p < 0.01), and body fat percentage (PLA-EX, p < 0.01; PRO-EX, p < 0.0001) after the intervention. In addition, serum adiponectin (PLA-EX, p < 0.0001; PRO-EX, p < 0.001), leptin (PLA-EX, p < 0.05; PRO-EX, p < 0.0001), growth/differentiation factor 8 (PLA-EX, p < 0.05; PRO-EX, p < 0.01), albumin (PLA-EX, p < 0.05; PRO-EX, p < 0.01), total cholesterol (PLA-EX, p < 0.001; PRO-EX, p < 0.0001), triglycerides (PLA-EX, p < 0.0001; PRO-EX, p < 0.0001), and controlled attenuation parameters measured by liver ultrasound were significantly decreased (PLA-EX, p < 0.05; PRO-EX, p < 0.0001). The PRO-EX group showed no significant difference in circulating free fatty acid levels before and after the intervention, whereas PLA-EX levels decreased after the intervention (p < 0.01). Muscle mass (p < 0.05), muscle strength (p < 0.001), and insulin-like growth factor 1 (p < 0.05) were significantly increased by the intervention in the PRO-EX group but not in the PLA-EX group. Testosterone (p < 0.01), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p < 0.01), aspartate aminotransferase (p < 0.0001), and alanine aminotransferase (p < 0.001) were significantly reduced in the PRO-EX group but not in the PLA-EX group. The combination of RE and adequate protein intake (1.5 g/kg body weight/day) synergistically increased fat metabolism, induced an increase in IGF-1 in the blood, and increased muscle mass and strength in sedentary adults.

Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA) is a fast, non-invasive, relatively low-cost, and user-friendly technique; however, to obtain greater validity of the estimates, the predictive equations used must be population specific. Thus, the objectives of this study were: (1) to test the validity of four BIA equations used for fat-free mass (FFM) estimation and one model for fat mass (FM) estimation in adults with overweight or obesity; (2) develop and cross-validate new equations to estimate FFM to adults with overweight or obesity, and specific for those with obesity. The non-probabilistic sample included 269 individuals, 53.2% with overweight and 46.8% with obesity, aged 18-79 years, randomly divided into two groups: development ( Most existing equations were not valid and new equations were derived: (1) for individuals with overweight or obesity: CCC = 0.982; r The new proposed models provide valid options to estimate FFM in an adult population with overweight/obesity.",

    "title": "Fat-Free Mass: Friend or Foe to Metabolic Health?",
    "abstract": "Fat mass (FM) and fat-free mass (FFM) are body composition estimates commonly reported in research studies and clinical settings. Recently, fat-free mass indexed to height (fat-free mass index; FFMI) has been shown to be positively associated with impaired insulin sensitivity or insulin resistance. Consequently, hypertrophic resistance training which can increase FFM was also questioned. This paper sets out to evaluate these propositions. In this narrative review, we discuss possible reasons that link FFMI to adverse metabolic health outcomes including the limitations of the body composition model that utilizes FFM. The safety of resistance training is also briefly discussed. Approximately 50% of FFM is comprised of skeletal muscle (SM), with the other 50% being viscera, skin, and bone; FFM and SM cannot be conflated. FFM and fat mass (FM) can both rise with increasing body weight and adiposity, indicating a positive correlation between the two compartments. Risk assessment models not adequately adjusting for this correlation may cause erroneous conclusions, however which way FM and FFM are indexed. Adipose tissue accumulation with weight gain, measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry or bioelectrical impedance, can inflate FFM estimates owing to increased connective tissue. Increased adiposity can also result in fat deposition within skeletal muscle disrupting metabolic health. Importantly, non-skeletal muscle components of the FFM, i.e., the liver and pancreas, both critical in metabolic health, can also be negatively affected by the same lifestyle factors that impact SM. The most frequently used body composition techniques used to estimate FM and FFM cannot detect muscle, liver or pancreas fat infiltration. Prospective evidence demonstrates that resistance training is a safe and effective exercise modality across all ages, especially in older adults experiencing age- or disease-related declines in muscle health. The association between FFM and insulin resistance is largely an artefact driven by inadequate assessment of skeletal muscle. If FM and FFM are used, at the minimum, they need to be evaluated in context with one another. Body composition methods, such as magnetic resonance imaging, which measures skeletal muscle rather than fat-free mass, and adipose tissue as well as muscle ectopic fat, are preferred methods. Resistance training is important in achieving and maintaining good health across the lifespan. While strength and power are critical components of resistance training, the reduction of skeletal mass through ageing or disease may require hypertrophic training to mitigate and slow down the progression of this often-inevitable process.",

    "abstract": "Obesity may blunt exercise responsiveness to improve muscular adaptations. The effect of resistance training (RT) targeting different body regions on muscle and inflammatory markers is unclear. This study aimed to investigate the impact of upper (upper body exercises), lower (lower body exercises), or combined (upper body + lower body exercises) RT on muscle and inflammatory markers, body composition, and performance in overweight and obese men. Sixty overweight and obese men (age, 31 ± 4 yr) were randomly assigned to one of four groups: upper-body RT (UB; n = 15), lower-body RT (LB; n = 15), combined RT (UB + LB; n = 15), or control (C; n = 15). The training protocol consisted of three exercise sessions per week for 12 wk. Blood samples for measuring serum markers (follistatin, myostatin, C-reactive protein (CRP), adiponectin, tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), and irisin) were obtained at baseline and 48 h after the final training session. Fat mass (FM), body fat percentage, skeletal muscle mass (SMM), and fat-free mass were measured using bioelectrical impedance analysis (InBody 720). SMM, fat-free mass, UB and LB strength and power, follistatin, follistatin/myostatin ratio, adiponectin, and irisin significantly increased, whereas FM, body fat percentage, myostatin, CRP, and TNF-α significantly reduced from pre- to post-training in all training groups ( P < 0.05). Changes in LB muscle power ( r = 0.558), both UB ( r = 0.518) and LB ( r = 0.419) muscle strength, and follistatin ( r = 0.545) had moderate positive relationships with ΔSMM, whereas changes in myostatin ( r = -0.585) had a moderate negative relationship with ΔSMM. Also, changes in myostatin ( r = 0.825) and CRP ( r = 0.715) had a strong positive relationship with ΔFM, whereas TNF-α ( r = 0.467) had a moderate positive relationship with ΔFM. Follistatin ( r = -0.789) and adiponectin ( r = -0.713) had a strong negative relationship with ΔFM, whereas irisin ( r = -0.426) had a moderate negative relationship with ΔFM. Combined RT elicits the greatest increases in follistatin, follistatin/myostatin ratio, and adiponectin, and decreases in myostatin and CRP compared with other training groups in overweight and obese men. However, systemic improvements may be achieved through performing UB or LB RT alone.",

    "abstract": "Regular physical activity (PA) and Mediterranean diet (MeDi) adherence independently improve glycemic control and clinical outcomes in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This study examined the associations between PA, body composition (BC), MeDi adherence, and glycemic control in Dalmatian T2DM patients. A cross-sectional study was conducted at the University Hospital of Split (November-December 2023) during an open call for T2DM patients. Data collected included blood/urine samples, blood pressure, BC, and anthropometrics. MeDi adherence and PA were assessed via the Mediterranean Diet Service Score and the International PA Questionnaire-Short Form. Among 252 participants (median age: 67 years, IQR: 60-73; 51.6% women; median T2DM duration: 10 years, IQR: 6-20), PA levels were low (31.4%, N = 79), moderate (45.2%, N = 114), and high (23.4%, N = 59), with uniformly low MeDi adherence across groups. Low PA was associated with higher body mass index (BMI) and lower phase angle (PhA). PA negatively correlated with fat mass (FM; %) and visceral adiposity. Positive BMI predictors included FM (kg), total body water, visceral fat level, and PhA, while fat-free mass, intracellular water, and FM (%) were negative predictors. The estimated glomerular filtration rate was the only positive predictor of the total metabolic equivalent of the task score. PA enhances BC and metabolic health, but inadequate MeDi adherence limits these benefits in the T2DM population. To optimize glucose control and health outcomes, public health initiatives must emphasize MeDi adherence and a combination of aerobic and resistance training.",

This meta-analysis aimed to assess the effects of TRE when followed in combination with various forms of exercise, including aerobic, resistance, and combined aerobic and resistance [concurrent] training on body composition. Studies published up to May 2023 were searched in EBSCOhost (MEDLINE, CINAHL, SPORTSDISCUS), PubMed, and SCOPUS databases. Fifteen studies, including 338 participants, that evaluated TRE vs. unrestricted eating in individuals performing exercise were analyzed. A random-effects model was used to calculate the weighted mean effect sizes (ES) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI's). According to the pooled results, TRE had a small but significant reduction of fat mass (FM) kg with an effect size of -0.20 (95% CI = -0.28 to -0.13, p < 0.001) and on body fat percent (BF%) with an effect size of -0.23 (95% CI = -0.35 to -0.11, p < 0.001). The prediction interval ranged from -0.48 to 0.08 for FM and from -0.64 to 0.18 for BF%, respectively. TRE did not significantly alter fat-free mass (FFM) kg compared to control (p = 0.07). Furthermore, age, body mass index (BMI), exercise type, study duration, and energy intake did not have a significant impact on the variation in effect sizes according to the subgroup analyses (p > 0.05). TRE with exercise may reduce fat mass compared to an unrestricted eating window exercise-matched control while preserving FFM. However, more studies are needed.",

Forty-two healthy, trained male volunteers underwent a four-week intervention, randomly divided into three groups: (i) Sleep Low-No Carbohydrates (SL-NCHO): consuming all carbohydrate intake at regular intervals prior to evening training, (ii) Sleep High-Low Glycemic Index (SH-LGI), and (iii) Sleep High-High Glycemic Index (SH-HGI). In both SH-LGI and SH-HGI, carbohydrates were distributed throughout the day, both pre-(60% of total intake) and post-evening training (40% of total intake). The SH-LGI and SH-HGI groups diverged in evening carbohydrate quality, featuring LGI and HGI foods, respectively. All participants performed a standardized exercise program combining resistance exercise and high-intensity interval training. Body composition was assessed using skinfold measurements and bioelectrical impendence analysis. Physical fitness was assessed by measuring VO There was a significant time-effect on both body composition and physical fitness indices. Bodyfat percentage decreased by an average of 1.5% (p < 0.001), fat-mass by 1.4 kg (p < 0.001) and fat-free mass increased by 0.9 kg (p = 0.006). A time-effect was also observed in VO A balanced dietary plan with sufficient nutrient and energy intake promotes body composition optimization and physical fitness, independently of carbohydrate type or timing. This study points towards implementing flexible nutrition interventions, emphasizing the potential of tailored dietary strategies to optimize health and physical fitness. The trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT05464342.",

    "title": "Effectiveness of resistance training in preventing sarcopenia among breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy: A systematic review and meta-analysis.",
    "abstract": "Breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy experience body composition changes impacting treatment outcomes. The role of resistance training in mitigating chemotherapy-induced sarcopenia in breast cancer patients is not well defined. This study aims to assess the efficacy of resistance training in preventing sarcopenia among breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. A systematic search was conducted across PubMed, EMBASE, Medline, the Cochrane Library, and CINAHL until May 5, 2023. Selected literature focused on the effects of resistance training on body fat, muscle mass, muscle strength, and physical performance in breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. Cochrane Risk of Bias tool version 2.0 was employed for quality assessment, and data were analyzed using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis version 2.0. Eleven randomized controlled trials (RCTs) showed that resistance training had a significant positive impact on reducing body fat (SMD = -0.250, 95% CI [-0.450, -0.050]), increasing lean body mass (SMD = 0.374, 95% CI [0.178, 0.571]), and enhancing handgrip strength at both the affected site (SMD = 0.326, 95% CI [0.108, 0.543]) and the nonaffected site (SMD = 0.276, 95% CI [0.059, 0.492]). Additionally, significant improvements were observed in leg press strength (SMD = 0.598, 95% CI [0.401, 0.796]) and overall physical performance (SMD = 0.671, 95% CI [0.419, 0.923]). Resistance training is a recommended intervention for reducing body fat, increasing muscle mass, muscle strength, and enhancing physical performance in breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. Ideal low-intensity resistance training programs span 8-24 weeks, with 20-to-90-min sessions 2-4 times weekly. Regimens generally entail 8-12 repetitions at 40%-90% of one-repetition maximum test, with free-weight resistance training targeting major muscle groups yielding substantial benefits. Further research should explore outcomes across different chemotherapy phases and investigate long-term resistance training effects for a comprehensive view.",

    "title": "Utility of fat-free adipose tissue correction formula for tracking body composition changes with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry.",
    "abstract": "Fat loss is often the target of weight loss interventions; however, preservation of lean soft tissue (LST) may be more important for health and weight maintenance. Though some LST loss may be inevitable when tracking body composition changes using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), correcting for the fat-free component of adipose tissue (FFAT) in DXA-derived LST (DXALST) has been proposed. This analysis sought to evaluate differences between DXALST and FFAT-corrected LST (FFATLST) amongst varied populations and interventions to understand application of the correction formula on LST outcomes. 226 subjects were analyzed across five prior studies. Three studies evaluated combined nutrition and exercise (high-intensity interval training [HIIT] or high-intensity resistance training [HIRT]) interventions, including HIIT + HIRT with pre- and post-nutrient timing (HIITRT), HIIT + essential amino acids (HIITAA), and HIRT + protein (HIRTPRO). Remaining studies evaluated HIIT (HIITOW) and protein following bariatric surgery (BARPRO). Pre and post total body DXA scans were used to measure DXALST, body mass, and fat mass (FM). The correction formula was applied to calculate FFATLST. Paired sample t-tests were used to evaluate differences between DXALST and FFATLST change scores (Δ) across all subjects, within each study and intervention. Significant differences between ΔDXALST and ΔFFATLST were observed for BARPRO (mean difference [MD; ΔDXALST-ΔFFATLST] ± standard error [SE]: -3.5 ± 1.2 kg, p < 0.001), as well as HIRTPRO (-0.1 ± 0.2 kg, p = 0.004). When evaluating LST, the FFAT correction may be specifically applicable to cases of significant weight loss (>10% of original weight) or body recomposition (≥2% FM loss and ≥2% LST gain).",

    "abstract": "Understanding important features for performance in non-disabled bench press and Paralympic powerlifting may inform talent identification and transfer models. The aim of this scoping review was to describe features associated with bench press performance. We conducted a systematic search of three electronic databases (PubMed, SportDiscus and EMBASE) to identify studies involving non-disabled and Para athlete populations that investigated features related to bench press one-repetition maximum (1RM), across six domains (anthropometric, body composition, demographic, technical, disability and neuromuscular). Search terms included \"resistance training\", \"para powerlifting' and \"one repetition max\". No date restrictions were include in searches. Studies using adult participants, with at least six-months of bench press experience, who were able to bench press their body mass were included. Thirty-two studies met our inclusion criteria. Twenty-four studies involved non-disabled athletes (total n = 2,686; 21.9% female) and eight involved Para athletes (total n = 2,364; 39.4% female). Anthropometric (17 studies) and body composition (12 studies) features were most studied; half of the 32 studies investigated features from a single domain. Of anthropometric variables, upper arm circumference shared the strongest association with bench press 1RM in non-disabled (r = 0.87) and para-athletes (r = 0.65). Upper limb fat free mass (r = 0.91) and body mass index (r = 0.46) were the body composition variables sharing the strongest association with bench press 1RM in non-disabled and para-athletes. Few studies considering the uncertainty of their results. Practices of open and transparent science, such as pre-registration and data sharing, were absent. The development of bench press talent identification and sport transfer models will require future studies to investigate both non-training and training modifiable features, across multiple domains. Large longitudinal studies using information from athlete monitoring databases and multivariable model approaches are needed to understand the interacting features associated with bench press performance, and for the development of talent identification models.",

    "abstract": "Menopause has a significant impact on the endocrine system of middle-aged women, resulting in a loss of skeletal muscle mass (SMM), changes in fat mass (FM) and a reduction in strength capacity. Resistance training (RT) and a high-protein diet (HPD) are effective methods for maintaining or increasing SMM. This study aims to determine the effects of HPD and RT on body composition, muscle thickness and strength capacity in postmenopausal women. In total 55 healthy postmenopausal women (age: 58.2 ± 5.6 years, weight 69.1 ± 9.6 kg, height 166.5 ± 6.5 cm) successfully participated in the study. The women were randomly assigned to either group: training + protein (2.5 g/kg fat-free mass (FFM)) (n = 15; TP); only training (n = 12; T); only protein (2.5 g/kg FFM) (n = 14; CP) or control (n = 14; C). TP and T performed RT for 12 weeks with three training sessions and five exercises each. CP and C were prohibited from training during the period. The main parameters analysed for body composition were FFM, SMM, FM, muscle thickness of the M. rectus femoris, M. biceps femoris, M. triceps brachii and M. biceps brachii muscles. Strength was tested using a dynamometer for grip strength and 1-RM in the squat (BBS) and deadlift (DL). The SMM significantly increased by RT (TP: (Δ+1.4 ± 0.9 kg; p < 0.05; d = 0.4; T: Δ+1.2 ± 1.3kg; p < 0.05; d = 0.3) and FM could be reduced only in T: (Δ-2.4 ± 2.9 kg; p < 0.05; d = 0.3). In muscle thickness a significant increase in the M. biceps brachii in both training groups (TP: (Δ+0.4 ± 0.3 cm; p < 0.05; d = 1.6; T: (Δ+0.3 ± 0.3 cm; p < 0.05; d = 0.9) and in M. biceps femoris only in TP (Δ+0.3 ± 0.4 cm; p < 0.05; d = 0.9) were observed. HPD without training does not affect body composition, A significant increase in grip strength (TP: Δ+4.7 ± 2.4 kg; (p < 0.05; d = 1.5; T: (Δ+3.6 ± 3.0 kg; p < 0.05; d = 0.8), in BBS (TP: (Δ+30.0 ± 14.2 kg; p < 0.05; d = 1.5; T: (Δ+34.0 ± 12.0 kg; p < 0.05; d = 2.4) and in DL (TP: (Δ+20.8 ± 10.3 kg; p < 0.05; d = 1.6; T: (Δ+22.1 ± 7.6 kg; p < 0.05; d = 2.0) was observed in both training groups. The CP also recorded a significant increase in the BBS (Δ+7.5 ± 5.4 kg; p < 0.05; d = 0.4) and in DL (Δ+5.5 ± 7.7 kg; p < 0.05; d = 0.5). No significant differences were detected for TP and T for any of the parameters. The results indicate that RT enhances body composition and strength capacity in postmenopausal women and is a preventive strategy against muscle atrophy. Besides HPD without training has a trivial significant effect on BBS and DL. HPD with RT has no clear additive effect on body composition and strength capacity. Further studies are needed to confirm these observations.",

Participants in both the intervention and control groups will receive weekly subcutaneous injections of 2.5 mg tirzepatide for 4 weeks, uptitrating the dose to 5.0 mg from weeks 5 to 8, and by 2.5 mg every 4 weeks until reaching 15 mg in week 21, which they will maintain until the end of the intervention period at 6 months, when participants will be taken off the medication. The intervention group will receive personalized weeklylifestyle coaching with a focus on protein intake and resistance training for 6 months. Participants in the control group will attend a diet and exercise group counselling session at programme inception and will be sent a summary of the session's content at months 2 and 4. Aside from these events, health coaches will only interact with control group participants on a reactive basis. From month 6 to month 12, participants from both groups will no longer have access to their MDTs. The trial's co-primary endpoints include weight loss, fat-free to fat-mass ratio and composite strength measures at 12 months (6 months following the end of treatment), compared with baseline. Secondary endpoints include percentage change in weight, fat-free to fat-mass ratio, and composite strength from baseline to 6 months, side effect incidence, and change in cardiometabolic risk factors at 12 months. Quality of life and programme engagement represent the study's exploratory endpoints. A total of 688 participants enrolled in the study, with a mean age of 44.6 (± 11.4) years and a mean body mass index of 34.8 (± 7.5) kg/m This RCT will be the first to assess the effectiveness and sustainability of a real-world intensive, multidisciplinary DWLS, and it should highlight the potential of such a service for long-term obesity treatment compared with programmes that deliver standard health counselling.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of 6-weeks resistance training (RT) on appetite, energy intake and body composition in young women with and without obesity, and to examine the relationship between these variables. Thirty-five young women were divided according to the amount of body fat [with obesity (n = 16) and without obesity (n = 19)]. Appetite was assessed through self-reported hunger, fullness, desire to eat, satiety quotient, food frequency diary and motivations to eat palatable food (power of food scale) in both fasted and fed states (after a standardized breakfast). Energy intake and body composition were evaluated at pre- and post-6 weeks of RT. Results showed that self-reported hunger increased significantly in both fasted and fed states (p = 0.007 and p = 0.029, respectively), while self-reported fullness decreased at the fasted state (p = 0.030) in both groups. There were no significant effects for desire to eat fatty, sweet, savory and salty foods, motivation to eat palatable foods, or for total energy intake. Food frequency analysis indicated a decrease in consumption of soup and past (p = 0.045), vegetables and eggs (p = 0.034), and leafy vegetables (p = 0.022) in both groups. Fat-free mass increased significantly in both groups (p = 0.011 and p = 0.003), while fat mass did not show significant changes. There were no correlations between changes in appetite/energy intake and changes in body composition. In conclusion, following the 6-week RT program, both women with and without obesity exhibited increased self-reported hunger alongside decreased fullness, suggesting an increase in orexigenic drive. However, neither group showed an increase in energy intake and fat mass, while both groups experienced an increase in fat-free mass. Registered under Brazilian Registry of Clinical Trials n°.

This resulted in raw measures for all three devices showing greater dehydration on BIVA compared to published norms for athletes using a separate BIA device. Compared to the 5C FFM, significant differences (p < 0.05) were observed on all three equations for BIA Raw bioimpedance measurements differ among devices due to technical, technological, and biological factors, limiting interchangeability of data across BIA systems.

Women with stage I-III breast cancer were randomly assigned to a strength training group (ST, n = 23) performing supervised heavy-load strength training twice a week during chemotherapy, or a usual care control group (CON, n = 17). Muscle strength and body composition were measured and biopsies from m. vastus lateralis collected before the first cycle of chemotherapy (T0) and after chemotherapy and training (T1). Muscle strength increased significantly more in ST than in CON in chest-press (ST: +10 ± 8%, p < .001, CON: -3 ± 5%, p = .023) and leg-press (ST: +11 ± 8%, p < .001, CON: +3 ± 6%, p = .137).

No significant changes from T0 to T1 and no significant differences between groups were observed in muscle fiber size. For myonuclei per fiber a non-statistically significant increase in CON and a non-statistically significant decrease in ST in type I fibers tended (p = .053) to be different between groups. Satellite cells tended to decrease in ST (type I: -14 ± 36%, p = .097, type II: -9 ± 55%, p = .084), with no changes in CON and no differences between groups.

    "abstract": "The International Society of Sports Nutrition (ISSN) provides an objective and critical review of the use of a ketogenic diet in healthy exercising adults, with a focus on exercise performance and body composition. However, this review does not address the use of exogenous ketone supplements. The following points summarize the position of the ISSN. 1. A ketogenic diet induces a state of nutritional ketosis, which is generally defined as serum ketone levels above 0.5 mM. While many factors can impact what amount of daily carbohydrate intake will result in these levels, a broad guideline is a daily dietary carbohydrate intake of less than 50 grams per day. 2. Nutritional ketosis achieved through carbohydrate restriction and a high dietary fat intake is not intrinsically harmful and should not be confused with ketoacidosis, a life-threatening condition most commonly seen in clinical populations and metabolic dysregulation. 3. A ketogenic diet has largely neutral or detrimental effects on athletic performance compared to a diet higher in carbohydrates and lower in fat, despite achieving significantly elevated levels of fat oxidation during exercise (~1.5 g/min). 4. The endurance effects of a ketogenic diet may be influenced by both training status and duration of the dietary intervention, but further research is necessary to elucidate these possibilities. All studies involving elite athletes showed a performance decrement from a ketogenic diet, all lasting six weeks or less. Of the two studies lasting more than six weeks, only one reported a statistically significant benefit of a ketogenic diet. 5. A ketogenic diet tends to have similar effects on maximal strength or strength gains from a resistance training program compared to a diet higher in carbohydrates. However, a minority of studies show superior effects of non-ketogenic comparators. 6. When compared to a diet higher in carbohydrates and lower in fat, a ketogenic diet may cause greater losses in body weight, fat mass, and fat-free mass, but may also heighten losses of lean tissue. However, this is likely due to differences in calorie and protein intake, as well as shifts in fluid balance. 7. There is insufficient evidence to determine if a ketogenic diet affects males and females differently. However, there is a strong mechanistic basis for sex differences to exist in response to a ketogenic diet.",

    "abstract": "Emerging evidence suggests that resistance training (RT) can mitigate respiratory muscle weakness in hemodialysis (HD) patients. However, the underlying mechanisms responsible for these beneficial effects remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of periodized RT on respiratory muscle strength and its relationship with handgrip strength (HGS), fat-free mass (FFM), nitric oxide (NO), and interdialytic weight gain (IWG) in HD patients. Thirty-three patients were randomly assigned to two groups: control (CTL; n=18) and RT (n=15). The RT group did not perform any additional exercise training specific to the respiratory tract. Maximal inspiratory (MIP) and expiratory (MEP) pressures, peak expiratory flow (PEF), HGS, FFM, NO, and IWG were measured before and after the intervention period. Participants in the RT group engaged in a 24-week RT program, three times per week. RT resulted in significant improvements in MIP, MEP, PEF, as well as enhancements in HGS, FFM, NO, and IWG (p<0.05). Notably, inverse correlations were observed between MIP (r=-0.37, p=0.03) and PEF (r=-0.4, p=0.02) with IWG. Thus, the amelioration of HGS and FFM coincided with a reduction in respiratory muscle weakness among HD patients. Decreased IWG and increased circulating NO are plausible mechanisms contributing to these improvements.",

    "abstract": "The appropriate use of predictive equations in estimating body composition through bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) depends on the device used and the subject's age, geographical ancestry, healthy status, physical activity level and sex. However, the presence of many isolated predictive equations in the literature makes the correct choice challenging, since the user may not distinguish its appropriateness. Therefore, the present systematic review aimed to classify each predictive equation in accordance with the independent parameters used. Sixty-four studies published between 1988 and 2023 were identified through a systematic search of international electronic databases. We included studies providing predictive equations derived from criterion methods, such as multi-compartment models for fat, fat-free and lean soft mass, dilution techniques for total-body water and extracellular water, total-body potassium for body cell mass, and magnetic resonance imaging or computerized tomography for skeletal muscle mass. The studies were excluded if non-criterion methods were employed or if the developed predictive equations involved mixed populations without specific codes or variables in the regression model. A total of 106 predictive equations were retrieved; 86 predictive equations were based on foot-to-hand and 20 on segmental technology, with no equations used the hand-to-hand and leg-to-leg. Classifying the subject's characteristics, 19 were for underaged, 26 for adults, 19 for athletes, 26 for elderly and 16 for individuals with diseases, encompassing both sexes. Practitioners now have an updated list of predictive equations for assessing body composition using BIA. Researchers are encouraged to generate novel predictive equations for scenarios not covered by the current literature.Registration code in PROSPERO: CRD42023467894.",

    "abstract": "This study explored the effects of resistance training (RT) volume on muscle hypertrophy in postmenopausal and older females. This systematic review searched randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, and SciELO. Studies with postmenopausal (age ≥ 45 y) or older females (age ≥ 60 y) that compared RT (whole-body) effects on muscle hypertrophy with a control group (CG) were included. Independently reviewers selected the studies, extracted data, and performed the risk of bias of RCTs (RoB2) and certainty of the evidence (GRADE). Whole-body lean mass, free-fat mass, and skeletal muscle mass measurements were included as muscle hypertrophy outcomes. A random-effects model standardized mean difference (Hedges'g), and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) were used for meta-analysis. Fourteen RCTs (overall RoB2: some concerns, except one study with high risk; GRADE: low evidence) were included. RT groups were divided into low (LVRT, total volume: 445.0 au) and high-volume (HVRT, total volume: 997.3 au). Most exercises performed were arm curl, bench press or chest press, calf raise, leg curl, leg extension, leg press or squat, seated row or lat pulldown, and triceps pushdown. Both groups experienced muscle hypertrophy (HVRT = ∼1.3 kg vs. LVRT = ∼0.9 kg) when compared to CG, although HVRT demonstrated moderate effects size (HVRT = 0.52, 95%CI: 0.27, 0.77) and LVRT demonstrated small effects size (LVRT = 0.34, 95%CI: 0.14, 0.53). Compared to CG, results suggest that the HVRT protocol elicits superior improvements in muscle hypertrophy outcomes than LVRT in postmenopausal and older females.",

    "abstract": "A disease known as sarcopenic obesity is characterized by decreased lean body mass in conjunction with excessive amounts of adipose tissue. Skeletal muscle mass, also known as SMM, is responsible for the largest share of fat-free mass in the body and plays an extremely vital role in the maintaining of metabolic health. Physical activity and exercise boosts the physiological health and overall quality of life of senior citizens. The objective of the study is to investigate the effectiveness of varied exercise interventions among the geriatric people with sarcopenic obesity. During the time period (2016-2023), a scoping review was undertaken using PubMed, orthopedic journals, and the Google Scholar database, and six literature evidences relating to the topic were discovered and subsequently analyzed. The study includes six randomized control trial publications that investigated the effectiveness and impact of exercise therapies on sarcopenic obesity. According to the pre and post-test values found in the reviewed articles, we discovered that resistance exercise is more effective than aerobic or combination exercise therapies. In conclusion, according to this scoping analysis, resistance training is more effective than other types of exercise in improving muscle mass in older people with sarcopenic obesity.",

    "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has become an increasingly important public health disease with a high incidence rate and mortality. Although several studies have explored the effectiveness of resistance exercise in improving the prognosis of CKD patients, the number of studies is still limited and the results are still controversial. We conducted this meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCT) studies to evaluate the effectiveness of resistance exercise on CKD patients. The PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were searched from the inception date to October 2023. The meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate 12 main indicators, including glomerular filtration rate (GFR)(ml/(min•1.73m2)), C-reactive protein (CRP) (mg/L), serum creatinine (mg/dL), hemoglobin (g/dL), Glycosylated Hemoglobin, Type A1C (HBA1c) (%), high Density Lipoprotein (HDL) (mg/dL), low Density Lipoprotein (LDL) (mg/dL), 6-min walk(m), body mass index (BMI) (kg/m Sixteen RCT studies were included in this meta-analysis from 875 records. GFR exhibited no significant change in CKD patients treated with resistance exercise (WMD 1.82; 95%CI -0.59 to 4.23; P = 0.139). However, 6-min walk (WMD 89.93; 95%CI 50.12 to 129.74; P = 0.000), fat-free mass (WMD 6.53; 95%CI 1.14 to 11.93; P = 0.018) and grip strength (WMD 3.97; 95%CI 1.89 to 6.05; P = 0.000) were significantly improved with resistance exercise. The level of CRP (WMD - 2.46; 95%CI -4.21 to -0.72; P = 0.006) and HBA1c (WMD - 0.46; 95%CI -0.63 to -0.29; P = 0.000) dropped significantly after resistance exercise treatment. Resistance exercise can improve physical function, metabolic condition, inflammatory response and cardiopulmonary function in CKD patients, specifically reflected in the increase of indicators fat-free mass, grip strength, 6-min walk, as well as the decrease of indicators HBA1c and CRP.",

    "abstract": "Nutrition and exercise are important interventions for sarcopenia. There were few studies on oral oligopeptide nutrition preparations combined with exercise to intervene in the older people with sarcopenia. The aim of this study was to verify the effectiveness of oligopeptide nutrition preparation combined with exercise intervention on the older people with sarcopenia in community. A total of 219 subjects aged 65 years or older with sarcopenia were randomly divided into 4 groups. The nutrition group (n = 58) was given individualized nutrition education and oral oligopeptide nutrition preparation. The exercise group (n = 50) received exercise intervention. The combined group (n = 52) received both oral nutrition preparation and exercise interventions. The control group (n = 59) only received individualized nutrition education. The nutrition preparation can provide energy 185kcal and protein 24.2g per day. The exercise intervention including warm-up exercise, resistance exercise and aerobic exercise, the training time was 60min for 5 times every week. The intervention lasted for 16 weeks. Hand grip strength, gait speed, body composition and hematology parameters were measured before and after intervention. A total of 159 subjects completed the study. Compared with baseline, the left grip strength and 6-m walking speed of the subjects in nutrition group increased significantly after the intervention, and the grip strength of both hands in exercise group and combined group increased significantly. The body weight of the subjects in nutrition group, exercise group and combined group increased significantly after intervention, but no increase in soft lean mass (SLM) and skeletal muscle mass (SMM) was observed in any of the four groups. The fat-free mass (FFM) of the legs of the control group, exercise group and nutrition group decreased after intervention, and only the FFM of the legs of the combined group maintained the level before the intervention. Both oral peptide nutrition and exercise interventions can improve the muscle strength or function of the older people with sarcopenia. However, there were no increases in muscle mass observed.

    "title": "Moderate-intensity Combined Training Induces Lipidomic Changes in Individuals With Obesity and Type 2 Diabetes.",
    "abstract": "Alterations in the lipid metabolism are linked to metabolic disorders such as insulin resistance (IR), obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Regular exercise, particularly combined training (CT), is a well-known nonpharmacological treatment that combines aerobic (AT) and resistance (RT) training benefits. However, it is unclear whether moderate-intensity exercise without dietary intervention induces changes in lipid metabolism to promote a \"healthy lipidome.\" The study aimed to investigate the effect of 16 weeks of CT on plasma and white adipose tissue in both sexes, middle-aged individuals with normal weight, obesity (OB), and T2D using an ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS) untargeted lipidomics approach. Body composition, maximum oxygen consumption (VO2max), strength, and biochemical markers were evaluated before and after the control/training period and correlated with lipid changes. CT consisted of 8 to 10 RT exercises, followed by 35 minutes of AT (45%-70% VO2max), 3 times a week for 16 weeks. The CT significantly reduced the levels of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acid side-chains (SFA/MUFA) in sphingolipids, glycerolipids (GL) and glycerophospholipids (GP) as well as reducing fat mass, circumferences and IR. Increased levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids in GPs and GLs were also observed, along with increased fat-free mass, VO2 max, and strength (all P < .05) after training. Our study revealed that 16 weeks of moderate-intensity CT remodeled the lipid metabolism in OB, and T2D individuals, even without dietary intervention, establishing a link between exercise-modulated lipid markers and mechanisms that reduce IR and obesity-related comorbidities.",

    "title": "Simplified and Accurate Approach to Sleep Disorder Prediction Using Body Composition Metrics: A Development and Validation Study.",
    "abstract": "Predicting the risk of sleep disorders such as insomnia, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and comorbid insomnia and sleep apnea (COMISA) typically requires costly and time-consuming assessments. The SLEEPS algorithm simplifies this process using only nine questions, including body mass index (BMI). However, BMI alone cannot capture differences in body composition, as individuals with the same BMI may have different muscle and fat distribution. This study aims to improve sleep disorder prediction by incorporating body composition metrics. To achieve this, we applied a tree-based machine learning algorithm to a dataset of 3,291 patients, evaluating demographic data, sleep-related questions, and body composition metrics as potential features for the model. The final feature selection was performed using Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) method. The resulting model, I-SLEEPS (InBody-based SimpLE quEstionnairE Predicting Sleep disorders), used a total of 10 features, including skeletal muscle index (SMI) and fat-free mass index (FFMI) instead of BMI, along with the original SLEEPS questionnaire items. I-SLEEPS achieved superior predictive accuracy (AUROC > 0.93 for insomnia, OSA, and COMISA) compared to SLEEPS (AUROC > 0.90). Additionally, our approach significantly enhanced area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) values, which is critical for addressing the imbalanced datasets of insomnia and COMISA. Furthermore, our analysis revealed distinct relationships between muscle mass indices (SMI and FFMI) and the risks of insomnia, OSA, and COMISA, providing new insights into the role of body composition in sleep disorders. By leveraging InBody analysis, I-SLEEPS offers a practical, non-invasive alternative to traditional screening methods such as polysomnography.",

This study aimed to assess the validity of three portable ultrasonic stadiometers for measuring unstretched standing stature in comparison to a portable floor-standing mechanical stadiometer in Brazilian adults. Cross-sectional study carried out with a convenience sample of 115 individuals (51.3 % women) with a mean age of 31.5 ± 9.3 years and able to stand independently. The portable ultrasonic stadiometers Avanutri®, Balmak® and Inbody® were compared to the portable mechanical floor-standing stadiometer Avanutri®, which was treated as a reference, to measure unstretched standing stature. Differences between mechanical and ultrasonic stadiometers were analyzed by paired-sample t-tests with 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI). Furthermore, the equivalence level was assessed using the Two One-Sided Test (TOST) procedure. Statistically equivalent absolute mean differences were observed in the comparative analysis between the stadiometers. The Avanutri® and Balmak® ultrasonic stadiometers produced significant systematic bias of 0.79 cm (95%CI: 0.471; 1.116) and 0.40 cm (95%CI: 0.084; 0.715), respectively. The Inbody® ultrasonic stadiometer produced a systematic bias of -0.03 cm (95%CI: -0.291; 0.229), below the 1 mm limit. The Inbody® portable ultrasonic stadiometer demonstrated validity for accurately measuring standing stature in Brazilian adults.",

Concordance correlation coefficient for total fat mass (FM) and total lean mass (LM) between in-body BIA and DXA were 0·91 and 0·89. The bias of in-body BIA for percentages of total FM and total LM was 0·91 % (2·46 %) and -1·74 % (-2·80 %) compared with DXA, respectively. Absolute limits of agreement were wider for total FM in obese men and women and for total LM in overweight men than their counterparts. Gradience in the distribution of total and regional FM content was observed across different BMI categories and its combinations with waist circumference and metabolic status.

    "title": "Validation of a newly developed low-cost, high-accuracy, camera-based gait analysis system.",
    "abstract": "Gait analysis is essential for evaluating locomotor function and fall risk, particularly in the elderly and in various musculoskeletal disorders. Traditional gait analysis systems face challenges such as technical difficulties, high cost, and complexity of use. Therefore, there is a need for a more accessible and cost-effective system with a wider clinical applicability. This study aimed to validate the newly developed IB-gait® system (InBody, Republic of Korea), a camera-based gait analysis tool, by comparing it against the VICON system. A total of 28 community-dwelling adults without gait abnormalities (mean age 24.9 years) were enrolled in this study. The participants underwent gait analysis at their self-selected speed using VICON and IB-gait® simultaneously. Nine spatiotemporal gait parameters, including stride length (m), step length (m), stride duration (s), double-limb duration (s), stance phase (s), swing phase (s), cadence (velocity × 120/stride length), and gait velocity (m/s) were measured. The agreement between the two systems was tested using Bland-Altman plots and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). The IB-gait® showed a high degree of agreement with the VICON system in most gait parameters. The ICC showed excellent reliability for stride length (0.97), step length (0.92), gait velocity (0.97), cadence (0.97), and stride duration (0.79). However, it showed lower reliability in time-based parameters, including double-limb duration (0.12), stance phase (0.54), swing phase (0.241), and stance/swing phase ratio (0.11). The IB-gait® system appears to be a feasible and cost-effective alternative to VICON system for gait analysis, particularly showing a high level of agreement in the distance-based parameters. Its practicality in clinical settings makes it a valuable tool for widespread use in gait analysis. However, further refinement of time-based parameter measurements and validation in diverse patient populations are needed to enhance its applicability.",

    "abstract": "A novel automated auscultatory upper arm cuff blood pressure (BP) monitor KOROT V2 Doctor (InBody BPBIO280KV) was developed for professional use. An electronic stethoscope embedded in the device cuff records the Korotkoff sounds, which are graphically displayed during deflation allowing visual evaluation by the healthcare professional. The device provides automated measurements of BP and this study evaluated its accuracy. The requirements of the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation/European Society of Hypertension/International Organization for Standardization (AAMI/ESH/ISO) Universal Standard (ISO 81060-2:2018) and its Amendment 1.2020-01 were applied. Participants were recruited to fulfill the age, sex, BP, arm circumference, and cuff distribution criteria of the Universal Standard and its Amendment in a general population using the same arm sequential measurement method. Three cuffs of the test device were tested for arm circumference 23-28, 28-35, and 33-42 cm. Data from 85 individuals were analyzed [mean age: 56.4 ± 16.0 (SD) years, 50 men, arm circumference 23-42 cm]. For validation Criterion 1, the mean difference ±SD between the test device and reference BP readings (N = 255) was -1.3 ± 6.0/1.5 ± 5.0 mmHg (systolic/diastolic; threshold ≤5 ± 8 mmHg). For Criterion 2, the SD of the averaged BP differences per individual (N = 85) was 4.61/3.48 mmHg (systolic/diastolic; threshold ≤6.82/6.78 mmHg). The KOROT V2 Doctor (InBody BPBIO280KV) device for professional use, which provides automated auscultatory measurements with visual display of the Korotkoff sounds, comfortably fulfills all the requirements of the AAMI/ESH/ISO Universal Standard (ISO 81060-2:2018) in a general population and can be recommended for clinical use.",

    "abstract": "A novel automated auscultatory upper-arm cuff blood pressure (BP) monitor for office use (KOROT P3 Accurate, previously InBody BPBIO480KV), which displays Korotkoff sound curves for each BP reading was recently developed. This study investigated whether the review of Korotkoff sound curves by healthcare professionals further improves the accuracy of the device by identifying unreliable BP readings. Three observers assessed independently the morphology of Korotkoff sound curves of BP measurements obtained during an ISO 81060-2:2018 validation study, and classified them as of good, fair, or poor quality (low amplitude or sound intensity, aberrant morphology, background noise, signal artifact, auscultatory gap, irregular rhythm). The observers were blinded to the study BP measurements. Korotkoff sound curves of 255 BP readings obtained in 85 individuals were analyzed (mean age 57.3 ± 15.0 years, 53 men). Of the SBP readings 80.4/12.2/7.4% were classified as good/fair/poor, and DBP 76.9/12.2/10.9%. Inter-observer agreement in detecting poor-quality curves was 84.7/83.1% (systolic/diastolic). Of poor-quality curves, 10.5/60.7% (systolic/diastolic) clustered in the same individuals. The validation criterion 1 [mean test-reference BP difference ≤5 ± 8 (SD) mmHg] was satisfied for readings with good (0.1 ± 4.9/0.3 ± 3.8 mmHg, systolic/diastolic) and fair-quality curves (-0.4 ± 6.4/0.2 ± 5.0), but not for poor-quality ones (2.7 ± 8.8/3.6 ± 8.1). By excluding poor-quality readings (40 of 255), criterion 1 of the validation study was improved (0.2 ± 4.9/0.2 ± 3.9 versus 0.3 ± 5.5/0.6 ± 4.7 mmHg). The visual assessment of Korotkoff sounds generated during automated auscultatory BP measurement by the KOROT P3 Accurate professional monitor identifies unreliable readings and further improves the device accuracy.",

    "title": "Reliability and Validity of an Ultrasonic Device for Measuring Height in Adults.",
    "abstract": "The ultrasonic stadiometer was originally developed as a device to measure and monitor children's height. However, an ultrasonic stadiometer (InLab S50; InBody Co., Seoul, Korea) was used to measure adults' height in the 2018 Korea Community Health Survey (KCHS). This study was conducted to assess the reliability and validity of the InLab S50 in adults. The study subjects were 120 adults (reliability test, n=20; validity test, n=100) who had visited a health screening center. The intra- and inter-rater reliabilities of InLab S50 were assessed using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The agreement between InLab S50 and an automatic stadiometer (HM-201; Fanics, Busan, Korea) was assessed using Pearson's correlation coefficient and Bland-Altman analysis. The intra- and inter-rater reliabilities of the InLab S50 were excellent (ICC=0.9999 and 0.9998, respectively). The correlation coefficient of the height measured by the two measurement devices was very high (r=0.996). The difference (Δheight [HM-201-InLab S50]) was -0.15±0.78 cm (95% limit of agreement [LOA], -1.69 to 1.38). After excluding the values outside 95% LOA, the difference was further reduced to -0.05±0.59 cm (95% LOA, -1.20 to 1.10). This study showed that the InLab S50 is a reliable and valid device for the measurement of adults' height. Therefore, we think that InLab S50 could be used to measure adults' height in household health surveys such as the KCHS.",

    "abstract": "Cancer is one of the leading causes of death for children; however, appropriate nutritional status can positively affect disease progression and outcome. The aim of this study was to present our self-developed nutritional risk screening method, relate it to another validated tool and to objective bio-impedance measures. We intended to recommend a screening algorithm which can be used in our pediatric oncology facilities. We analysed data from 109 pediatric oncology patients (age 3-18) at the 2nd Department of Pediatrics, Semmelweis University between 2017 and 2018. The nutritional status was assessed by the Nutrition screening tool for childhood cancer (SCAN), Nutrition risk screening for pediatric cancer (NRS-PC) our own self-developed screening tool and Bio-impedance analysis (InBody 720 and S10). Classifier properties for low muscle mass measured by Bio-impedance analysis were compared for SCAN and NRS-PC in the overall sample and in the different phases of the disease. The AUC of 0.67 [95% CI:0.58,0.75] of the SCAN was significantly lower (Z = -2.46, p = 0.014) than in the case of the NRS-PC (AUC = 0.75 [95% CI:0.67,0.82]), indicating that NRS-PC has better classifier properties to identify children with lower muscle mass. No significant difference was found in the different phases of the disease. Based on our results, we suggest screening high BMI patients first with NRS-PC. However, in case of low BMI bio-impedance measures provide more precise information on muscle mass and nutritional risk. Further data are needed to decide whether the NRS-PC is sensitive enough in normal BMI patients.",

    "abstract": "Ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring is recommended to improve the management of hypertension. Here, we investigated the accuracy of BP estimated using a wearable cuff-less device, InBodyWATCH, compared with BP measured using a manual sphygmomanometer. Thirty-five adults were enrolled (age 57.1 ± 17.9 years). The BP was estimated using InBodyWATCH with an individualized estimation based on a neural network model. Three paired sets of BPs from the two devices were compared using correlation analysis and Bland-Altman plots (n = 105 paired BP readings). The correlations for both systolic and diastolic BP (SBP and DBP) between the two devices were high (r = 0.964 and 0.939, both P < 0.001). The mean difference was 2.2 ± 6.1 mmHg for SBP and -0.2 ± 4.2 mmHg for DBP; these were not significant (P = 0.472 for SBP and P = 0.880 for DBP). The proportions of estimated SBP/DBP obtained from the InBodyWATCH within ± 5 mmHg of manual SBP/DBP were 71.4%/83.8%; within ± 10 mmHg they were 86.7%/98.1%; and within ± 15 mmHg they were 97.1%/99.0%. The estimated BP from this wearable cuff-less device correlated highly with the manual BP and showed good accuracy, suggesting its potential to be used in ambulatory BP monitoring.",

    "abstract": "Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is currently the most commonly used method in clinical practice to measure body composition. However, the bioelectrical impedance analyzer is not designed according to different countries, races, and elderly populations. Because different races may have different body compositions, a prediction model for the elderly population in Taiwan should be developed to avoid population bias, thereby improving the accuracy of community evaluation surveys.Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) was used as a standard method for comparison, and impedance analysis was used for the development of a highly accurate predictive model that is suitable for assessing the body composition of elderly people.This study employed a cross-sectional design and recruited 438 elderly people who were undergoing health examinations at the health management center in the Tri-Service General Hospital as study subjects. Basic demographic variables and impedance analysis values were used in four predictive models, namely, linear regression, random forest, support vector machine (SVM), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) models, to predict DXA body composition. The data from 354 study subjects were used to develop the predictive model, while the data from 84 study subjects were used to validate the accuracy of the predictive model.The body composition of elderly people as estimated by InBody 720 was highly correlated with that estimated by DXA. The correlation coefficient between InBody 720 and DXA for muscle mass was 0.969, and that for fat mass was 0.935. Consistency analysis results showed that InBody 720 tends to underestimate muscle mass and fat mass. A comparison of the accuracy of the linear regression, random forest, SVM, and XGBoost models showed that the linear regression has the highest accuracy. The correlation coefficient between the new model and DXA for muscle mass and fat mass were 0.977 and 0.978, respectively.The new predictive model can be used to monitor the nutrition status of elderly people and identify people with sarcopenia in the community.",

The proposed fat channel is based on an anatomical model of the human body. We propose a novel probe that is optimized to efficiently radiate the R-band frequencies into the fat tissue. We use our probe to evaluate the path loss of the fat channel by studying the channel transmission coefficient over the R-band frequencies. We conduct extensive simulation studies and validate our results by experimentation on phantom and ex-vivo porcine tissue, with good agreement between simulations and experiments. We demonstrate a performance comparison between the fat channel and similar waveguide structures. Our characterization of the fat channel reveals propagation path loss of ∼0.7 dB and ∼1.9 dB per cm for phantom and ex-vivo porcine tissue, respectively. These results demonstrate that fat tissue can be used as a communication channel for high data rate intra-body networks.",

Twenty-six apparently healthy adults participated in the study. Predicted RMR (pRMR) was calculated by the InBody 520™ and measured RMR (mRMR) was determined by 30-minute gas analysis and ventilated hood system. Of the 78 measurement trials conducted, 64 yielded acceptable measurement trials. A Pearson product-moment correlation was used to determine the relationship between pRMR and mRMR (r=0.87, P<0.001). No significant difference existed between the pRMR (1650.89±295.96 kcal) and mRMR (1675.36±278.69 kcal) values (P=0.19). Study findings suggest that the InBody520™ provides valid measurements of RMR in apparently healthy adults and can be an effective and efficient method for collecting data in a clinical setting.",

    "abstract": "Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is a convenient and child-friendly method for longitudinal analysis of changes in body composition. However, most validation studies of BIA have been performed on adult Caucasians. The present cross-sectional study investigated the validity of two portable BIA devices, the Inbody 230 (BIA8MF) and the Tanita BC-418 (BIA8SF), in healthy Taiwanese children. Children aged 7-12 years (72 boys and 78 girls) were recruited. Body composition was measured by the BIA8SF and the BIA8MF. Dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) was used as the reference method. There were strong linear correlations in body composition measurements between the BIA8SF and DXA and between the BIA8MF and DXA. Both BIAs underestimated fat mass (FM) and percentage body fat (%BF) relative to DXA in both genders The degree of agreement in lean body mass (LBM), FM, and %BF estimates was higher between BIA8MF and DXA than between BIA8SF and DXA. The Lin's concordance correlation coefficient (ρc) for LBM8MF met the criteria of substantial to perfect agreement whereas the ρc for FM8MF met the criteria of fair to substantial agreement. Bland-Altman analysis showed a clinically acceptable agreement between LBM measures by BIA8MF and DXA. The limit of agreement in %BF estimation by BIA and DXA were wide and the errors were clinically important. For the estimation of ALM, BIA8SF and BIA8MF both provided poor accuracy. For all children, LBM measures were precise and accurate using the BIA8MF whereas clinically significant errors occurred in FM and %BF estimates. Both BIAs underestimated FM and %BF in children. Thus, the body composition results obtained using the inbuilt equations of the BIA8SF and BIA8MF should be interpreted with caution, and high quality validation studies for specific subgroups of children are required prior to field research.",

    "title": "Agreement Between Omron 306 and Biospace InBody 720 Bioelectrical Impedance Analyzers (BIA) in Children and Adolescents.",
    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to test the convergent validity of Omron 306 using Biospace InBody 720. A total of 267 participants (145 boys; aged 10.4-17.9 years) completed testing during a single session. Each measure provided percent body fat (%BF), while the InBody 720 included fat-free mass (FFM). The validity was examined using the Pearson correlation. Limits of agreement (LOA) and multiple linear regression were also used to determine the impact of both age and FFM on the associations between the 2 measures. The 2 measures of %BF were correlated by .63 (p < .001) in boys and .89 (p < .001) in girls. The mean difference (i.e., InBody - Omron) for %BF in boys was - 4.7% with a lower LOA of - 20.5% and upper LOA of 11.2%. The same comparison for girls resulted in a difference of 3.0% with a lower LOA of - 10% and upper LOA of 4%. Examination of the residuals obtained from multiple linear regression indicated that FFM was the only statistically significant predictor of differences in boys (βFFM = - 0.25 ± 0.08%, p = .001). There were no significant associations for girls. Findings indicate that estimates of %BF obtained from Omron in boys exceed estimates from InBody 720. Disagreement was evident in younger boys with lower levels of FFM. Girls' %BF was closer between the 2 bioelectrical impedance analyzer measures (less residual) with age and FFM not explaining the disagreement. Overall, the 2 measures were not equivalent.",

    "abstract": "Body mass index (BMI) is the most common parameter for classifying nutritional status. However, body composition (BC) may vary considerably among individuals with identical BMIs; consequently, we need to assess BC efficiently. Bariatric surgery is the most effective method for treating obesity. To improve quality assessment of postoperative weight loss, it is essential to assess BC. Multi-frequency bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is a practical assessment instrument, though limited when applied among the obese population. Despite dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) being the current reference standard, it has physical limitations which restrict its practical application. This study, therefore, sought to correlate the results of BC assessments of same patient population using BIA and DXA. This was a cross-sectional validation study with patients invited to undergo a multi-frequency BIA (Inbody 720®) and afterwards a DXA examination Statistical analyses were done using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), paired t-test and the Bland-Altman plot analysis. A total of 108 patients were randomly selected, with 73 meeting the criteria for study inclusion. Most were female (89%) and had an average BMI of 40.17 ± 4.08 kg/m(2). An almost perfect correlation of fat (kg) and fat-free mass (kg) was found in results from the BIA and DXA examination (ICC = 0.832 and ICC = 0.899, respectively). A substantial correlation was also found between the percentage of body fat (%BF) and the percentage of fat-free mass (%FFM). The comparison made between the BIA and DXA using the t-test showed significant differences between all parameters. The Bland-Altman plot showed that the BIA method tends to underestimate the FM and overestimate the LM measurements when compared with DXA. BIA proved to be a safe alternative for assessing BC in clinically severely obese patients and thus provides a more accessible evaluation tool for this population. But, consideration should be given to the formula added to the BIA measurement, adjusting the values to differences observed in order to reduce errors when compared with the DXA measurements.",

    "abstract": "One of the major challenges in field research has been the difficulty to adequately measure body composition, such as % body fat and fat-free mass (FFM). Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to investigate the convergent validity of the portable bioelectrical impedance body composition analyzer, the Inbody 230, with dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) (General Electric Lunar Prodigy). The study population consisted of 145 men and women (age, 44.6 ± 20 years; BMI, 24.5 ± 3.8 kg·m(-2)). We measured body composition (fat mass, % body fat, total FFM, trunk FFM, and appendicular FFM) using DXA and the Inbody 230. Results show strong significant correlations between both methods for fat mass, % body fat, total FFM, and trunk FFM (r = 0.94-0.99). Furthermore, we showed a modest significant correlation between both methods for appendicular FFM (r = 0.63). Finally, as shown by Bland-Altman analysis, no significant biases were observed between Inbody 230 and DXA for fat mass, % body fat, and total FFM. However, trunk and appendicular FFM were shown to have significant biases between the Inbody 230 and DXA. In conclusion, the present study indicated that the portable Inbody 230 may be an acceptable device to measure fat mass, % body fat, and total FFM (except for women) in healthy adults. In addition, there appears to be a systematic bias for the estimation of trunk and appendicular FFM with the Inbody 230 in men and women.",

We hypothesized that there would be no significant differences between dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry and either the Biospace (Los Angeles, CA, USA) InBody 520 or 720 multifrequency bioelectrical impedance analysis devices for total lean body mass (LBM), appendicular lean mass (ALM), trunk lean mass (TM), and total fat mass (FM) in 25 men and 25 women (including lean, healthy, and obese individuals according to body mass index), age 18 to 49 years, weight of 73.6 ± 15.4 kg. Both devices overestimated LBM in women (~2.5 kg, P < .001) and underestimated ALM in men (~3.0 kg, P < .05) and women (~1.0 kg, P < .05). The 720 overestimated FM in men (1.6 kg, P < .05) and underestimated TM in women (0.6 kg, P ≤ .05).

    "abstract": "In diagnosis and treatment of obesity, body composition analysis including percent body fat (%BF) is useful in the clinical setting. Because bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) could be used quickly, easily and was non-invasive in clinical setting, the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the usefulness of multi-frequency BIA with eight-point tactile electrodes (MF-BIA8; InBody 720, Biospace) compared with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in healthy children and adolescents. A total of 166 children and adolescents under 18 (male, n = 86; female, n = 80) were recruited. Height, weight, body mass index (BMI) and Tanner stage were measured for each subject. The body composition such as fat-free mass (FFM), fat mass (FM), and %BF was measured on BIA and DXA and compared. On linear regression analysis, DXA FFM = 1.006(BIA FFM) + 0.554, R(2) = 0.99 and the standard error of the estimate (SEE) was 1.16 kg; DXA FM = 0.971(BIA FM) - 0.596, R(2) = 0.93; SEE, 1.34 kg; and DXA %BF = 0.940(BIA %BF) - 1.026, R(2) = 0.858; SEE, 3.03%. Limit of agreement in FFM, FM, and %BF was 0.7 +/- 2.3 kg, -0.9 +/- 2.9 kg and -2.2 +/- 6.1%, respectively. Although the %BF was not interchangeable with DXA, MF-BIA8 (InBody 720; Biospace) could be used to measure body composition of children and adolescents in the clinical field because of its high precision.",

We analysed percentage body fat (%BF) and compared the results with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) in adults and compared the results of the InBody with underwater weighing (UW) in children. All body composition devices were correlated (r 0.54-0.97; P< or =0.010) to DEXA except the Bod-eComm in women aged 71-80 years (r 0.54; P=0.106). In girls, the InBody %BF was correlated with UW (r 0.79; P< or =0.010); however, a more moderate correlation (r 0.69; P< or =0.010) existed in boys. Bland-Altman plots indicated that all body composition devices underestimated %BF in adults (1.0-4.8 %) and overestimated %BF in children (0.3-2.3 %). Lastly, independent t tests revealed that the mean %BF assessed by the Bod-eComm in women (aged 51-60 and 71-80 years) and in the Omron (age 18-35 years) were significantly different compared with DEXA (P< or =0.010). In men, the Omron (aged 18-35 years), and the InBody (aged 36-50 years) were significantly different compared with DEXA (P=0.025; P=0.040 respectively). In addition, independent t tests indicated that the InBody mean %BF in girls aged 10-17 years was significantly different from UW (P=0.001). Pearson's correlation analyses demonstrated that the Bod-eComm (men and women) and Omron (women) had significant mean differences compared with the reference criterion; therefore, the %BF output from these two devices should be interpreted with caution. The repeatability of each body composition device was supported by small CV (<3.0 %).",

This is the first report on BIS's accuracy in predicting relative fatness [percentage body fat (%BF)] in a heterogeneous sample according to a multicomponent model criterion. We compared %BF measurements from 2 BIS devices with those from a multicomponent model in a sample of Hispanic, black, and white adults. Equal numbers of apparently healthy men and women (n = 75 of each) from each racial-ethnic group, diverse in body mass index and age, volunteered. Reference %BF (%BF(4C)) was computed by using a 4-component (4C) model with total bone mineral content obtained from dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, body density from underwater weighing with measured residual lung volume, and total body water from traditional BIS. Estimations from InBody 720 (%BF(720)) and InBody 320 (%BF(320)) BIS analyzers were validated against %BF(4C). The %BF(720) (r = 0.85, SEE = 5.19%BF) and %BF(320) (r = 0.84, SEE = 5.17%BF) correlations were significant (P < 0.05) in the men; main effects were nonsignificant. Correlations for %BF(720) (r = 0.88, SEE = 4.85%BF) and %BF(320) (r = 0.89, SEE = 4.82%BF) also were significant in the women (P < 0.05); there was a main effect for method but not race-ethnicity. There were no sex-specific overestimations or underestimations at the extremes of the distributions. BIS estimates of %BF(4C) were well correlated in men and women. There were no significant methodologic differences in the men. The %BF(4C) was significantly underestimated by %BF(720) and %BF(320) in the women.",

Fifty healthy subjects (25 men and 25 women) with a mean (s.d.) age of 40 (12) y. TBW measured by deuterium oxide dilution; resistance (R) of arms, trunk and legs measured at frequencies of 5, 50, 250 and 500 kHz with an eight-polar tactile-electrode impedance-meter (InBody 3.0, Biospace, Seoul, Korea). An algorithm for the prediction of TBW from the whole-body resistance index at 500 kHz (height (2)/R(500) where R is the sum of the segmental resistances of arms, trunk and legs) was developed in a randomly chosen subsample of 35 subjects. This algorithm had an adjusted coefficient of determination (r2(adj)) of 0.81 (P<0.0001) and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.6 l (9%). Cross-validation of the predictive algorithm in the remaining 15 subjects gave an r2(adj) of 0.87 (P<0.0001) and an RMSE of 3.0 l (8%). The precision of eight-polar BIA, determined by measuring R three times a day for five consecutive days in a fasting subject, was < or =2.8% for all segments and frequencies. Eight-polar BIA is a precise method that offers accurate estimates of TBW in healthy subjects. This promising method should undergo further studies of precision and its accuracy in assessing extracellular water and appendicular body composition should be determined.

    "abstract": "Adolescent obesity has become a growing global health concern, contributing to the early development of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. This study aimed to evaluate the comprehensive effects of aerobic training combined with dietary intervention on anthropometric indices, body composition, and functional outcomes in obese adolescents. This retrospective study analyzed adolescents with obesity who received treatment between January 2021 and December 2024. A total of 129 adolescents with obesity who received treatment between January 2021 and December 2024 were retrospectively analyzed. Participants were assigned to a control group (aerobic exercise only, n = 61) or an observation group (aerobic exercise combined with nutritional intervention, n = 68). Both groups underwent a 12-week structured exercise program, while the observation group additionally received individualized nutritional guidance tailored to caloric needs and macronutrient balance. Anthropometric parameters, body composition, cardiopulmonary function, and physical fitness were assessed before and after the intervention. After 12 weeks, the observation group demonstrated significantly greater reductions in body mass index, waist circumference, body fat percentage, and visceral fat area compared with the control group (all P < .01). In addition, lean body mass, step test performance, vital capacity, and multiple measures of physical fitness, including muscular endurance, flexibility, and agility, showed more pronounced improvement in the observation group. These findings indicate that the combination of aerobic exercise and dietary intervention produces synergistic benefits, resulting in more effective reductions in adiposity and enhanced cardiopulmonary and physical performance. However, the retrospective and non-randomized design may limit the interpretation of causality. Integrating structured nutritional management with exercise training may represent an optimal, non-pharmacological strategy for the prevention and treatment of adolescent obesity.",

Body composition was evaluated using multifrequency bioimpedance: skeletal muscle mass (SMM), fat mass (FM), total body water, protein mass and basal metabolic rate (BMR). Physical performance was assessed using Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), maximal handgrip strength (HGS). Fasting interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels and other blood biomarkers were also measured. 113 participants completed the intervention (mean age 62.3 years; 79.6% female). After 12 weeks training, MoCA scores were improved in CTC12 group (n = 22, Δ = +0.46, p = 0.0045) and SD group (n = 22, Δ = +0.50, p = 0.0046), with no change in TC24 group (n = 23), walking group (n = 23), and control group (n = 23). Physiologically, CTC12 group increased SMM and BMR with small SPPB/HGS gains and showed a significant reduction in IL-6 levels; SD group reduced BMI and FM and increased BMR and SPPB; TC24 group increased BMR only; walking showed no measurable changes. For correlation analyses, ΔMoCA was positively associated with ΔSMM (p = 0.014) and ΔBMR (p = 0.004) in the CTC12 group, and negatively associated with ΔBMI (p = 0.002) and ΔFM (p = 0.002) in the SD group. CTC12, SD were associated with modest cognitive gains and distinct physiological patterns potentially linked to the muscle-brain axis, which may help guide exercise choices for older adults.",

    "abstract": "This study assessed musculoskeletal outcomes of a combined intervention comprising food-based protein supplementation, nutrition education (NE), and resistance exercise in older adults; comparing milk and soy milk as protein sources. Quasi-experimental study. Eighty-two community-dwelling adults aged ≥60 years completed the intervention. This 8-week cluster-based intervention assigned participants to 1 of 4 groups: exercise alone (Group 1), exercise plus NE (Group 2), exercise plus NE with milk supplementation (Group 3), and exercise plus NE with soy milk supplementation (Group 4). All groups engaged in resistance training 3 times per week, and all groups received weekly NE, except for Group 1. Body composition, and physical performance were measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and standardized tests at baseline and after the intervention. Within-group analyses showed that all groups experienced significant improvements in walking speed. Additionally, Group 3 exhibited improvements in handgrip strength (mean change: +4.41 kg), 5-time sit-to-stand performance (-1.94 s). Compared with other groups, Group 3 achieved greater gains in handgrip strength than Group 2 (-0.84 kg) and Group 4 (+0.52 kg), and showed a borderline significant improvement in total bone mineral density (BMD; +0.01 vs. -0.06 g/cm Exercise combined with NE and protein supplementation, particularly milk, may be associated with favorable bone health in older adults.

    "abstract": "Elite athletes are highly sedentary outside of sports and must stay active after retiring to remain healthy. While sports are often recommended to improve physical activity, the effect of sport training day on daily physical activity levels in adolescent athletes is not well described. The purpose was to assess (1) physical activity (i.e., step counts and activity score [METs]) and (2) sedentary behavior (e.g., total duration and prolonged [> 1 h] bouts) in male and female adolescent athletes across different training days (i.e., competition, practice, and rest days). Adolescent basketball and volleyball athletes wore an accelerometer continuously for 14 consecutive days while in-season. Training days (i.e., competition, practice, and rest days) were tracked for each athlete. In-person testing included anthropometrics, vertical jump height, and body composition via bioelectrical impedance. Thirty-nine athletes (15.6 ± 0.9 years; n = 24 female, n = 15 male) participated. Athletes were more physically active on competition and practice days (step count [mean ± SD]: competition: 13,021 ± 2,572, practice: 11,735 ± 1,875, rest: 6,742 ± 3,150 [p < 0.001]); activity score [METs]: competition: 35.6 ± 1.0, practice: 34.7 ± 0.9, rest: 33.0 ± 1.3 [p < 0.001]). Athletes had high total sedentary behavior across all training days (competition: 570.4 ± 89.3 min, practice: 619.5 ± 74.6 min, rest: 638.5 ± 90.8 min [p = 0.001]), but the greatest prolonged bouts of sedentary behavior on competition days (competition: 195.4 ± 100.9 min, practice: 115.9 ± 74.0 min, rest: 144.6 ± 96.2 min [p = 0.002]). Adolescent athletes were highly active on competition and practice days but did not meet physical activity guidelines on rest days, achieving only ~ 6,700 steps/day. Athletes were highly sedentary across all training days, averaging ~ 10 h/day of waking sedentary behavior. Only a third met physical activity guidelines regardless of training day. Adolescent athletes are highly sedentary and many fail to meet physical activity guidelines, challenging the notion that sports alone make individuals sufficiently active. Not applicable.",

    "abstract": "Exercise induced gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms affect a significant portion of endurance runners, resulting in discomfort and suboptimal performance. Protein intakes pre-exercise may have benefits; however, research investigating dietary intake prior to exercise suggests that many runners avoid foods high in protein before running to manage their GI symptoms. Unfortunately, clinical trials evaluating the effectiveness of this strategy are lacking. This study aimed to quantify exercise-induced GI symptoms, gut fullness, blood glucose response, and ratings of perceived exertion in response to low-protein (LP) and moderate-protein (MP) pre-exercise shake. This single-blind crossover study involved 13 recreational runners (eight females, five males) who completed a 10 km treadmill run at 85% of their 10 km race pace after consuming a shake with carbohydrate and whey protein at either a low-protein (0.15 g/kg body mass) or moderate-protein (0.4 g/kg body mass) dose 60 minutes prior to exercise. Due to increased whey protein and standardized carbohydrate, the shakes had differing energy contents. GI symptoms were assessed pre-shake, 60 minutes post-shake, and post-run using a questionnaire and gut fullness was assessed pre-shake, 15-, 30-, and 60 minutes post-shake, and post-run using a visual analog scale. Blood glucose was measured pre-shake, 30- and 60 minutes post-shake, and post-run using a capillary blood sample and rating of perceived exertion was assessed following the 10 km run. Total symptoms experienced increased over time ( Easily digestible protein sources up to 0.4 g/kg body mass consumed one hour before exercise are advised and generally well tolerated, though 0.4 g/kg body mass of protein was associated with increased bloating. However, protein intakes before exercise should be trialed prior to competition due to variations in individual tolerance.",

    "abstract": "Limited research has examined long-term training adaptations in elite Deaf athletes. This three-year longitudinal observational study characterized anthropometric and physical performance changes in the Polish Deaf National Basketball Team preparing for the Deaflympics (2019-2021). Eleven male athletes (age 26.9 ± 6.3 years) underwent annual assessments of body composition and performance, including countermovement jumps (CMJ, ACMJ), spike jump (SPJ), sprint speed (0-5 m, 0-20 m), and estimated VO₂max. A control group of physically inactive Deaf students (n = 15; age 21.1 ± 1.6 years) was also evaluated. Friedman ANOVA revealed stable body composition across seasons (p > 0.05; W = 0.01-0.22), except for a moderate increase in left-leg fat-free mass (p = 0.025; W = 0.33). While jump performance remained unchanged (p > 0.05; d = 0.18-0.32), sprint performance declined significantly (0-5 m: χ²(2) = 20.18, p < 0.001; 0-20 m: χ²(2) = 14.59, p = 0.001). Compared with inactive peers, players demonstrated superior physical capacity, including higher fat-free mass (d = 2.12), greater jump power (d = 3.46), and faster sprint times (d = - 1.03 to - 1.07), with a mean 2021 VO₂max of 47.3 ± 6.1 ml·kg⁻¹·min⁻¹. In conclusion, these elite athletes maintained morphology and power but showed declining sprint performance, likely due to COVID-19 disruptions. This study provides the first longitudinal evidence of performance trajectories in elite Deaf basketball players, underscoring the need for individualized, acceleration-focused monitoring to sustain long-term neuromuscular performance.",

This study looked at how postmenopausal women feel about their age and health, and whether doing regular resistance training affects these feelings. A total of 46 women aged between 50 and 69 years took part. Twenty-four of them had been doing resistance training for at least 7 years, while the other 22 did not exercise regularly.The women who exercised regularly felt, on average, 27% younger than their actual age, while those who did not exercise felt only 10% younger. The women in the exercise group also rated their health higher than those who did not train. However, there was no difference between the two groups when it came to happiness scores.Feeling younger was closely linked to better self-rated health and greater happiness. The study also found that self-rated health, happiness and waist-to-hip ratio together influenced how young women felt compared to their real age.In summary, postmenopausal women who have practiced resistance training for several years tend to feel younger and healthier. These benefits may be related to improvements in body composition, such as lower body fat and healthier waist measurements.",

Gender assignment followed multidisciplinary council decisions; some DSD cases underwent gender-appropriate surgical interventions, and HRT was initiated as puberty approached. Participants were divided into four age groups (<5, 5-10, 10-15, and ≥15 years), and anthropometric measures, pubertal status, muscle mass and strength, skinfold thickness, and sex hormone profiles were assessed. Among DSD cases, 30.8% had 46,XX DSD, 53.8% had 46,XY DSD, and 15.4% had mixed gonadal dysgenesis (MGD); ambiguous genitalia was the most common referral reason, and CYP21A2 was the most frequently identified mutation. In individuals aged ≥15 years, 46,XX DSD cases, regardless of gender of rearing, had lower height standard deviation scores (SDS) than healthy peers, whereas 46,XY DSD cases raised as females had higher height SDS than other DSD subgroups (p<0.01). In Individuals aged ≥15 years, muscle strength was highest in 46,XY DSD males and healthy males (p<0.01). Participation in sports was associated with higher muscle mass in both groups (p=0.03). Muscle strength correlated positively with serum testosterone (p< 0.001, R = 0.563). Chromosomal sex predominantly influenced final height, whereas muscle strength aligned with gender of rearing and testosterone levels.",

    "abstract": "Chronic respiratory diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, pneumoconiosis, interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pulmonary sarcoidosis, are major global causes of mortality and morbidity. Although the COVID-19 pandemic has influenced acute respiratory health, its impact on chronic respiratory conditions remains unclear. We estimated the global, regional and national burden of chronic respiratory diseases from 1990 to 2023, including risk factors, and evaluated how these burdens have shifted during the COVID-19 pandemic using the Global Burden of Disease Study 2023. In 2023, chronic respiratory diseases accounted for 569.2 million (95% uncertainty interval (UI), 508.8-639.8) cases and 4.2 million (3.6-5.1) deaths. The age-standardized death rate declined by 25.7% globally from 1990 to 2023 despite an increase in ILD and pulmonary sarcoidosis. Mortality declined in younger males, especially for asthma, whereas older adults experienced a rise in ILD and pulmonary sarcoidosis. Smoking was the primary risk factor for COPD, whereas high body mass index and silica exposure were key risk factors for asthma and pneumoconiosis. During the pandemic, the incidence of chronic respiratory diseases increased modestly, but the decline in mortality rates became more pronounced, highlighting the need for sustained global attention and action to address their long-term burden.",

    "abstract": "To assess the validity of the International Fitness Scale (IFIS) for evaluating cardiorespiratory fitness compared to the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) (criterion validity) and to examine associations with cardiometabolic and body composition outcomes (construct validity). A cross-sectional analysis was conducted on 282 adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (mean age 63.6 ± 8.1 years, 37.9% women). Self-reported fitness was assessed using IFIS, including overall, cardiorespiratory, muscular, speed-agility and flexibility scores. Objective cardiorespiratory fitness was assessed using the 6MWT. Associations with 6MWT, cardiometabolic (i.e., cardiovascular health score, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease [MASLD], high-sensitivity C-reactive protein) and body composition outcomes (i.e., body mass index [BMI], visceral adipose tissue volume, thigh fat-free muscle volume) were analyzed using ANCOVA (adjusted by sex and age) and ROC curves, compared using DeLong tests. Both IFIS overall and IFIS cardiorespiratory showed graded associations with 6MWT (p < 0.001 for ANCOVA models). For discriminating performance below the population-predicted mean 6MWT distance, IFIS cardiorespiratory showed an AUC of 0.615 (95% CI: 0.552-0.678). Apart from IFIS muscular, IFIS scores were significantly associated with all cardiometabolic and body composition outcomes, with ROC analyses showing at least similar predictive performance for IFIS overall and cardiorespiratory fitness scores compared to 6MWT. Notably, IFIS overall outperformed the 6MWT for predicting poor cardiovascular health (AUCs: 0.678 [95% CI: 0.618-0.737] versus 0.586 [95% CI: 0.517-0.654]) and MASLD (AUCs: 0.630 [95% CI: 0.563-0.696] versus 0.519 [95% CI: 0.443-0.595]). This study supports that IFIS may be a practical tool for adults with T2DM, showing evidence of criterion validity via graded association with 6MWT performance, and construct validity via significant associations with cardiometabolic and body composition outcomes. Although its ability to discriminate impaired functional capacity was limited, IFIS may serve as a feasible alternative for fitness assessment when objective testing is not possible in primary care.",

    "abstract": "This meta-analysis assessed the impact of low-volume high-intensity interval training (LV-HIIT) on body composition and cardiovascular health in children and adolescents, while examining potential moderating factors. A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library (CENTRAL), and CNKI from inception to April 2025. A three-level random-effects model was used to estimate the overall effects, and subgroup analyses supplemented with meta-regression were performed to explore potential moderators and sources of heterogeneity. A total of 23 studies (996 participants, including 246 females) were included, with 6 studies on normal-weight and 17 on overweight/obese individuals. Compared with controls, low-volume high-intensity interval training (LV-HIIT) significantly reduced BMI (g = -1.24), fat mass (g = -0.99), body fat (g = -0.89), waistline (g = -0.42), weight (g = -0.34), and SBP (g = -0.37), while improving VO LV-HIIT can effectively and time-efficiently improve body composition and cardiovascular health in children and adolescents, with overall effects comparable to MICT. Exercise prescriptions should carefully consider weight status, age, and intervention characteristics; however, given the limited number of studies and potential bias, the conclusions should be interpreted with caution. Limited descriptive comparisons indicate that LV-HIIT produces effects similar to SSG and SIT, and may offer greater benefits than MIIT. https://osf.io/exhjm/.",

    "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the gastrointestinal tract, characterized by persistent immune dysregulation. Umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular nanovesicles (MSC NVs) exhibit immunomodulatory properties, demonstrating significant therapeutic potential for clinical applications. This study sought to investigate the therapeutic effects of MSC NVs against colitis and elucidate the underlying mechanisms. MSC NVs were prepared from umbilical cord MSCs using a continuous filtration-extrusion method. The therapeutic effects of MSC NVs were assessed by tail vein injection in a murine model of DSS-induced colitis. MSC NVs significantly markedly ameliorated colitis-associated symptoms, including body weight loss, colon length reduction, and elevated disease activity index scores. MSC NVs not only mitigated colitis-induced intestinal barrier impairment and inflammatory responses, but also exhibited targeted biodistribution to inflamed colonic lesions. Unexpectedly, administration of MSC-NVs via the tail vein significantly altered the gut microbial composition in colitic mice, particularly enhancing the relative abundances of beneficial commensal genera  This study demonstrated that MSC NVs significantly alleviated DSS-induced colitis by modulating Th17/Treg balance in the colonic lamina propria, with hsa-miR-27b-3p identified as the key mediator through PIK3CA targeting and PI3K/AKT/STAT3 pathway inhibition. These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of filtration-extrusion-prepared MSC NVs as a safe and effective nanomedicine for IBD treatment.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the feasibility and accuracy of body-fat assessment using standardized skinfold-thickness assessment versus dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in Paralympic athletes. In this cross-sectional study, body composition was assessed in 49 male and female Paralympic athletes (Para cycling, Para skiing, Para swimming, wheelchair basketball, and wheelchair tennis) by a whole-body DXA scan and skinfold-thickness measurements conducted according to International Society for the Advancement of Kinanthropometry (ISAK) standards. Correlation and Bland-Altman analyses were conducted to compare both methods. DXA was feasible in all athletes, while the sums of 4, 7, and 8 skinfolds were obtained in 88%, 73%, and 73% of the athletes, respectively. Median DXA-derived body-fat percentage was 16.3% (13.4%-20.5%) in males and 27.8% (21.1%-33.4%) in females. Strong correlations were found between DXA-derived body-fat percentage and the sum of 4 (r = .85), 7 (r = .83), and 8 (r = .83) skinfolds. However, skinfold-based prediction equations for estimating body-fat percentage were associated with substantial negative bias (-2.0% to -7.9%) and large individual error compared with DXA. DXA is a feasible method for assessing body composition in Paralympic athletes, while ISAK skinfold measurements face some challenges due to disability-related landmarking issues. Despite these limitations, skinfold thickness remains strongly associated with DXA-derived body fat. It is recommended to measure all skinfolds that can be reliably obtained according to ISAK standards and interpret them as a cumulative \"sum of feasible sites,\" rather than enforcing a universal skinfold metric across all Paralympic athletes.",

    "abstract": "Risk of sarcopenia and poor nutritional status are observed in older adults receiving home care. Hence, the aim of the POWER trial is to investigate the effectiveness of a whey protein oral nutritional supplement (ONS) combined with an online resistance training (RT) programme compared to RT alone on physical function, nutritional status and health-related outcomes in community-dwelling older adults receiving supportive home care who are at risk of sarcopenia. This home-based, randomised controlled trial will include older adults aged ≥70 years, receiving supportive home care (professional and/or informal), who will be screened for sarcopenia via telephone. Forty-six participants will be randomised into either (i) ONS + RT or (ii) RT only trial arms. Participants in the ONS + RT group will be provided with a whey protein ONS enriched with leucine and vitamin D to consume day daily for 12 weeks. All participants will be provided with an online RT programme twice weekly via Zoom. The primary outcomes are physical function, measured using the Timed Up and Go test and nutritional status, measured using the Mini-Nutritional Assessment-Full Form. Secondary outcomes include body composition, dietary intake, gait speed, muscle strength, cognitive function, depression risk, activities of daily living, quality of life and feasibility of intervention implementation. All outcomes will be measured at baseline (T1), post-intervention (T2) and 12 weeks post-intervention (T3). This study will provide data on the effectiveness of a whey protein ONS enriched with leucine and vitamin D combined with an online RT programme delivered via Zoom, compared to the RT programme alone, for older adults at risk of sarcopenia and receiving supportive home care. If effective, this combined approach could act as an important strategy to support maintenance of physical function and nutritional status in older adults, for whom home-based interventions are likely a more feasible option.

    "abstract": "The benefits of physical activity on physical and mental health are well established. Exercise can be particularly advantageous in neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD), where progressive loss of muscle mass and impaired motor performance are common. We report the case of a 58-year-old man with PD who underwent a structured, adapted physical activity program in preparation for a relay swim across the Strait of Messina (Sicily, Italy). The aim was to evaluate changes in body composition (fat mass, fat-free mass) and performance following four months of adapted swimming training, alongside adapted physical activity in the gym and Nordic walking. The patient swam 1300 m in 42 min and 38 s in the relay, which was a marked improvement from the baseline and subsequent assessments. In conclusion, while a longer follow-up period and a larger patient sample would be necessary, the findings from this case study suggest that the adapted exercise program improved both physical fitness and body composition. This generally supports the key role of physical activity in managing Parkinson's disease and, in particular, the positive effects of adaptive sports training.",

    "abstract": "Adolescence is a critical window for cardiovascular (CV) development, yet the molecular drivers of vascular adaptation to regular exercise in youth remain poorly understood. This cross-sectional study assessed vascular structure and function alongside endothelial, metabolic, and lipoprotein biomarkers in 203 healthy young athletes (aged 10-16). Vascular phenotyping included carotid intima-media thickness (IMT), pulse wave velocity, and carotid deformation indices (strain, strain rate). Circulating nitric oxide (NO), endothelin-1, free triiodothyronine (fT3), leptin, low-density lipoprotein, and high-density lipoprotein were analyzed. Associations were examined using hierarchically adjusted multivariable linear regression, mediation and moderation were tested and sex-stratified/matched analyses were conducted. While training volume was not associated with endothelial markers, leptin was correlated positively with NO and negatively with diastolic strain rate, suggesting dual vascular actions. fT3 was inversely associated with IMT, indicating a potential protective role in vascular remodeling. Lipoprotein profiles showed no independent associations with vascular parameters. Hemodynamic load, particularly systolic blood pressure, emerged as the dominant determinant of arterial stiffness. Sex-specific differences across biomarkers and vascular indices support a multifactorial model: in active youth, vascular phenotype reflects hemodynamics, body composition, and endocrine-metabolic signals more than training; longitudinal mechanistic studies should clarify causal pathways and guide individualized cardiovascular risk profiling.",

    "title": "What makes females walk at comparable speeds to males? Physical, physiological, or biomechanical factors.",
    "abstract": "Although males typically have longer limbs and greater muscle mass than females, previous studies have reported no significant sex differences in self-selected walking speed. This suggests that females may adopt alternative biomechanical strategies to compensate for their anatomical disadvantages. However, the specific mechanisms that enable females to achieve a walking speed comparable to males remain unclear. One hundred and fifty-one young adults (76F,75M) performed a 3-min barefoot walking at their self-selected walking speed on a 10-m walkway. During walking, spatiotemporal gait parameters, vertical ground reaction forces, and foot and ankle joint kinematics were recorded. Anthropometric measurements and body composition were also obtained to assess physical capacity. Walking speed was compared between males and females, and contributing factors to walking speed were analyzed. Self-selected walking speed was not significantly different between sexes. However, when normalized by leg length, females exhibited significantly longer stride lengths and faster walking speeds than males (p < 0.05). Females also demonstrated greater ankle joint range of motion and walked with significantly greater ankle plantarflexion at toe-off, which likely contributed to increased forefoot pushing force. Additionally, females exhibited longer normalized stride lengths and faster stride times, resulting in faster normalized walking speeds compared to males. The findings suggest that females compensate for relatively shorter limb lengths and lower muscle mass by relying more on distal joint flexibility and passively generated push-off power, particularly at the ankle. Females may also adjust stride length and stride time to achieve walking speeds comparable to males despite anatomical differences. Interventions aimed at modifying push-off strategies may enhance walking efficiency and could inform the development of targeted, sex-specific gait training programs.",

    "abstract": "Cleary, A, Winchester, JB, Cochrane-Snyman, KC, and McBride, JM. The relationship between the NBA draft combine tests, advanced performance metrics, and perceived performance in National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I men's basketball. J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2025-The NBA Draft Combine (NBADC) assesses an athlete's size, length, and athleticism. Advanced metrics such as player efficiency rating (PER) and Win Share/40 (WS/40) quantify basketball performance. This study explored relationships between NBADC metrics, performance metrics, and perceived performance in a National Collegiate Athletic Association DI Men's Basketball team. Thirteen scholarship athletes (age 20.1 ± 0.64 years, height 1.9 ± 0.1 m, mass 93.9 ± 10.9 kg) participated. Players and coaches ranked each player at their position, creating perceived performance rankings (player rank [PR] and coaches rank [CR]). A Spearman's rank correlation was performed using PER, WS/40, PR, and CR as dependent variables, with anthropometric and physical data as independent variables. Statistical significance was set a priori ≤0.05. Stepwise linear regression identified predictive relationships. Win Share/40 significantly correlated with maximum vertical jump (MVJ) (ρ = 0.589, p ≤ 0.05). Maximum vertical jump explained 35% of WS/40 variability, and MVJ with body composition (BC) predicted 61.4%. Player efficiency rating and raw no-step vertical jump predicted 87.4% of WS/40. Coaches rank and standing reach explained 73.9% of WS/40, while CR alone explained 64.1% of PER. Results suggest lower body muscular power and body composition significantly relate to basketball performance. Coaches assessing players and projecting future contributions should prioritize vertical jump metrics and body composition over other NBADC assessments.",

    "abstract": "To analyze the effects of two 16-week physical exercise programs (jazz dance [JD] and concurrent training [CT]) compared with a control group (CG), as well as the impact of detraining (6 mo and 12 mo follow-ups), on menopausal symptoms in postmenopausal women. This is a randomized clinical trial with follow-up at 6 and 12 months. A total of 70 postmenopausal women (mean age: 53.19 ± 3.39 y) were included. Participants were randomly allocated into 3 groups: jazz dance, concurrent training, and control. The severity of menopausal symptoms was assessed using the Menopause Rating Scale (MRS). A linear mixed-effect model with random effects was used for statistical analysis under 2 approaches: intention-to-treat (ITT) and protocol adherence. A paired t test analysis of score changes was also conducted as a complementary descriptive analysis, between baseline and subsequent time points. Significant time-related changes in somatic, psychological, urogenital, and total symptoms were observed in both the ITT and per-protocol analyses (P < 0.005), although no significant group×time interactions were identified. All 3 groups (JD, CT, and even the CG) showed improvements in menopausal symptoms over time, with benefits persisting during follow-up. Regarding changes over time, the CT group experienced the greatest reduction in symptoms over time, reducing the total questionnaire score by more than 7 points postintervention, more than 9 points at the 6-month follow-up, and maintaining the benefits even after one year. JD also reduced symptoms, but to a lesser extent compared with CT, by almost 4 points postintervention, and 6 points at the 6-month follow-up, with benefits also persisting after 1 year. Although the CG also showed some improvement, it was less pronounced compared with the intervention groups. Although improvements in menopausal symptoms were observed over time within all groups, including the control group, no significant group×time interactions were found. Therefore, this study did not demonstrate a superior effect of JD or CT compared with the CG, only the results that compare the interventions and CG over time are interpretable.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to compare physical fitness and body composition in older adults with high and low levels of eating awareness and to examine the relationship between these parameters. This cross-sectional study included 120 older adults aged 65-70 years (60 with high eating awareness and 60 with low eating awareness). Eating awareness was assessed with the Eating Awareness Questionnaire (MEQ-30). To determine the physical fitness level, 30-second chair sit-and-stand test, Timed Up and Go test, 6-minute walking test, one-leg stand test, hand grip strength with a Jamar dynamometer (Sammons Preston, USA), and knee extension strength with a Lafayette digital dynamometer (USA). For body composition assessment, skeletal muscle mass, body fat percentage, and body mass index (BMI) were measured with the InBody 120 (InBody Co., Ltd., Seoul, Korea). Physical fitness and body composition were compared between older adults with and without eating awareness. In addition, the relationship between eating awareness, physical fitness and body composition was examined in all older adults. A statistically significant difference was found in all physical fitness and body composition assessment results between older adults with high and low eating awareness (p < 0.05). In addition, a statistically significant relationship was found between eating awareness (MEQ-30), physical fitness and body composition results in older adults (p < 0.05). This study showed that older adults with higher eating awareness tended to have better physical fitness results, greater muscle mass, and lower body fat percentage and BMI compared to those with lower eating awareness. In addition, lower eating awareness was associated with reduced physical fitness, decreased skeletal muscle mass, and increased body fat percentage and BMI. These findings indicate that eating awareness is closely related to both body composition and physical functionality in older adults, highlighting its potential role as an important behavioral factor in healthy aging.",

    "abstract": "Development of adolescent obesity is associated with substantial health risks and comorbidities and thus represents a major public health concern. This study aimed to examine the associations between dietary behaviours and physical activity with body composition indicators among Slovak adolescents. We used data from the Health Behaviour in School-Aged Children (HBSC) study conducted in 2022 in Slovakia. The sample consisted of 1225 adolescents (mean age 13.3 ± 1.4; 53.9% boys). The HBSC questionnaire items were used to assess frequency of fruits, vegetables, sweets, soft and energy drinks, breakfast consumption during weekdays, having breakfast with family, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and vigorous physical activity (VPA). Body height (cm) was measured using a SECA 213 portable stadiometer, and body composition was assessed via bioimpedance analysis (InBody 230). Linear regression was used to test associations between dietary behaviours and physical activity variables and body composition outcomes. More frequent breakfast eating during weekdays and more frequent sweets consumption were inversely associated with body mass index (BMI), percentage of body fat (PBF), visceral fat area (VFA) and fat-free mass index (FFMI). Higher MVPA was inversely associated with BMI, PBF and VFA but positively associated with FFMI. Greater VPA was associated with PBF and VFA, but inversely associated with FFMI. These findings suggest that more frequent breakfast consumption and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity are associated with favourable body composition parameters in adolescents.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic cancer (PC) is highly lethal, with surgery as the only curative option but significant postoperative morbidity. Prehabilitation shows promise in other cancers, yet no trials have examined supervised exercise during neoadjuvant chemotherapy in PC. The primary objective was to evaluate recruitment and adherence to a trimodal prehabilitation program during neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with non-metastatic PC. Secondary aims included assessing changes in physical condition, fatigue, quality of life (QoL) and some biomarkers. A prospective single-center study recruited adults diagnosed with non-metastatic PC scheduled for chemotherapy. Inclusion criteria were ECOG 0-2 and the ability to perform the one mile walk test. The intervention involved supervised exercise, respiratory muscle training, nutritional counselling, and psychological support. Primary outcomes were recruitment (10 patients/year) and adherence (≥70% of exercise, nutrition, or psychological sessions). Secondary outcomes included cardiorespiratory fitness (6-minute walking test [6MWT], mile time walk test, estimated VO₂peak), muscular strength (sit-to-stand [5STS] test and handgrip), global QoL (EORTC QLQ-C30), fatigue (PERFORM and FACIT), and body composition (body mass index (BMI)). Among 35 screened patients, 14 completed the prehabilitation program and 12 underwent surgery (in 30 months). 10 patients were recruited in 12 months. Adherence was acceptable across all components, with physical training achieving 100% attendance. Significant improvements were observed in respiratory capacity (p=0.000), gait speed (p=0.001), estimated VO₂peak (p=0.002), 6MWT (p=0.021), one mile walk test (p=0.000), 5STS (p=0.000), BMI (p=0.047), fatigue PERFORM (p=0.023) and FACIT (p=0.000), and QoL (p=0.017). Trimodal prehabilitation during neoadjuvant chemotherapy in PC can be implemented and may be associated with clinically meaningful improvements in physical fitness, fatigue, and QoL. Multicenter randomized controlled trials are warranted to determine its impact on postoperative outcomes.",

    "abstract": "In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), Atractylodes macrocephala Koidz. (Baizhu) is a fundamental herb for fortifying the spleen and replenishing qi, specifically used to treat syndromes characterized by weakness, and poor appetite due to spleen qi deficiency. Despite its long-standing use, the scientific basis for its anti-fatigue effect remains unclear. This study aimed to systematically evaluate the anti-peripheral fatigue activity of AMWE and elucidate its underlying mechanisms, thereby providing a scientific basis for its development as a functional food ingredient. A mouse model of peripheral fatigue was established over 33 days using forced swimming combined with intermittent fasting. During this period, mice were administered AMWE at doses of 0.75-3.0 g/kg body weight. The chemical composition of AMWE was characterized, and its effects on exercise performance, metabolic markers, muscle histology, and mitochondrial function were assessed. AMWE primarily contained 23.84 % polysaccharides (composed of 62.20 % glucose), 2.44 % Atractylenolide II, and 7.22 % Atractylenolide III. Treatment with AMWE improved physical condition, enhanced grip strength and exercise endurance, and increased liver and muscle glycogen storage. It also reduced anaerobic metabolites such as lactic acid (LA), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN). AMWE ameliorated damage to the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles and elevated blood amino acid levels. Importantly, AMWE up-regulated the mRNA and protein expression of the PGC-1α/NRF1/TFAM axis, improved mitochondrial function, increased substrate levels of pyruvate (PA) and acetyl-CoA (A-CoA) in the TCA cycle, enhanced the activity of key enzymes pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and citrate synthase (CS), and promoted ATP synthesis. AMWE exhibits significant anti-fatigue activity, which is achieved by promoting mitochondrial biogenesis and enhancing mitochondrial function via activation of the PGC-1α/NRF1/TFAM axis. The underlying mechanism is associated with the activation of the AMPK/SIRT1/PGC-1α signaling axis and the subsequent upregulation of downstream NRF1/TFAM, leading to improved TCA cycle flux and ATP production.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to examine whether second-generation oral contraceptive (OC) users exhibit greater muscle hypertrophy following resistance training compared to non-users across various targeted muscle groups. Fourteen young, untrained women using OCs (aged 28 ± 4 years) and 12 eumenorrheic non-users (NOC, aged 30 ± 4 years) underwent a 12-week resistance training programme. The thickness of seven muscles in the upper- and lower-limbs was measured using ultrasound, while body composition was assessed with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and the maximal torque of all relevant joints was tested before and after the intervention. Our results demonstrated a greater increase in arm lean tissue mass (LTM) in OC users (10.5%) compared to non-users (6.6%, time × group interaction p < 0.002). Additionally, greater hypertrophic gains were observed in three specific muscle groups in OC users (4.5%-7.9%) compared to non-users (1.5%-3.1%, time × group interaction, p ≤ 0.036). Despite these group differences in muscle growth, no group differences in strength gains were observed. This study indicates that second-generation OC users exhibit greater hypertrophic gains in specific muscle groups and a greater accretion of arm LTM compared to eumenorrheic non-users of OC. Further research is warranted to explore the physiological mechanisms behind the differences in muscle growth during resistance training between users and non-users of OC.",

A total of 64 players (16.5 ± 0.8 years-old; 33 male) participated in the Brazilian National Team preparatory stage for the Beach Handball World Championships (2017), and were grouped in selected and non-selected players. Participants were assessed for anthropometrics and body composition, countermovement jump, and ball speed throwing. Comparisons between groups were tested, and the outcomes were analyzed using logistic regression (SPSS 25.0; p < 0.05). Network analysis was used to establish systemic non-linear interrelationships between variables, and the Expected Influence was calculated (Rstudio). For male players, increments of 1 kg in fat-free mass and 1 m/s in ball speed, increased the odds of being selected by 44% and 17 times, respectively. For females, 1 cm increase in jump height and in palm diameter, increased the odds of being selected by 29.5%, and 6.7 times, respectively. The non-linear approach showed body mass as the expected influence variable for both selected and non-selected male and female players, differently of those variables observed using the logistic regression. The results reflect the multidimensional predictors of talent in beach handball, and represent important finding for coaches and stakeholders.",

    "abstract": "Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), assessed by maximal oxygen uptake (VO₂max), is one of the strongest indicators of cardiovascular health and overall risk of death. Somatotype provides a comprehensive description of the morphological constitution of the body, but is seldom used in the context of health or chronic disease risk assessment. The present study aimed to assess the relationship between CRF and somatotype in healthy adult Polish men and women. The study included 276 subjects (146 men and 130 women) aged 18-72 years. Anthropometric measurements were performed using the Martin and Saller method, and the somatotype was determined using the Heath-Carter modification of Sheldon's typology. The three main components of body composition assessed were endomorphy, mesomorphy, and ectomorphy. In addition, aerobic capacity was estimated using the Astrand-Ryhming test, with blood pressure and heart rate monitored at rest, and the latter also recorded during exercise. Statistical analyses were performed using the Kruskal-Wallis test, Mann-Whitney test and Pearson's correlation. The mesomorphic somatotype was the most common among men, while the endomorphic somatotype predominated among women. Somatotype differentiated body mass index (BMI, kg/m Somatotype significantly differentiates anthropometric parameters and CRF in adults. Mesomorphy favours higher aerobic capacity, while endomorphy is associated with less favourable blood pressure values and lower VO₂max. These findings highlight the potential value of somatotype as a complementary tool for assessing health risk and planning individual health-promoting interventions. The use of somatotype may be particularly useful given the known limitations of BMI, which does not differentiate between muscle and fat mass.",

In this review, we explore the multifaceted nature of the obesity paradox in HF, with a focus on emerging anti-obesity incretin-mimetic therapies, such as glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) and dual GLP-1/glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptor agonists. These agents have demonstrated remarkable efficacy in weight reduction and favorable cardiovascular profiles in patients with HF with preserved ejection fraction (EF), yet their use in other HF populations, such as HF with reduced EF, raises important clinical questions and the urgent need for future research. Concerns include the potential for LM loss, implications for sarcopenic obesity, and the uncertain impact of weight loss on outcomes in patients who may not benefit from weight loss. We also highlight the need to assess therapeutic outcomes beyond BMI, incorporating measures of CRF, such as peak oxygen consumption (VO₂ peak), quality of life, and functional capacity, using tools such as the 6-minute walk test. Barriers to implementation, including cost, provider hesitation, insurance restrictions, and patient level challenges are also reviewed. Finally, we call for future research using contemporary cohorts and advanced phenotyping to reevaluate the obesity paradox in the context of modern pharmacologic interventions. As obesity treatment continues to evolve, a patient-centered, individualized approach that integrates body composition, functional status, and comorbid conditions will be essential in optimizing care for individuals with HF.",

    "abstract": "Limited research is available on the bone health of female warfighters graduating from combat leadership courses like the US Army Ranger Training Course since combat roles opened to women in 2015. This investigation aimed to characterise the bone density, microarchitecture and strength of a small cohort of these female elite warfighters (FEW) to aid in understanding the physical resilience necessary for women to succeed in such courses. FEW (n=11) were assessed for body composition and whole-body areal bone mineral density (aBMD) and content (BMC) by DXA, bone microarchitecture at two distal tibia sites by high-resolution peripheral quantitative CT (HR-pQCT) and health and lifestyle outcomes by survey. Two female comparison cohorts (CC) of Army basic combat trainees were matched (3:1), to provide context to the FEW. FEW were similar to CC1 and CC2 in height, and lower in body fat (p<0.05). FEW whole-body aBMD and BMC were higher than CC1 (both p<0.01, Cohen's D=0.233 and 0.785, respectively). HR-pQCT measures demonstrated greater total density (13.4%; p=0.01), bone volume fraction (12.9%; p=0.03) and 26.0% higher estimated failure load (p<0.01) in the FEW compared with CC1 at the metaphysis. At the diaphysis, FEW tibiae had 10.2% higher estimated compressive stiffness and 10.3% higher estimated failure load (both p<0.05) than CC2 with no differences in other bone health measures. Lifestyle and health factors were similar between groups. Greater BMC and more favourable bone properties at the distal tibia were observed in the FEW compared with basic combat trainees, supplementing previous findings of exceptional body composition of women graduating from elite combat leadership courses. Considering the prevalence of BSI in female warfighters, further study is warranted to determine how bone status affects probability of course success.",

    "abstract": "While acute exercise has been shown to alter subsequent energy intake in adolescents with obesity, the role of the exercise-induced energy expenditure and substrate oxidation remains unknown. The present study investigates the effect of energy expenditure and substrate oxidation rates during an acute walking exercise on subsequent appetitive responses in adolescents with obesity. Body composition and maximal aerobic capacities were assessed in 25 adolescents [8 males, 12-16 years] with obesity. They then realized a control condition without exercise [CON] and an exercise session [EX, 40-min walking at 4 km h Post-exercise energy intake was reduced on EX compared with CON [1083 ± 253 vs. 950 ± 226 kcal; p = 0.041], with reduced absolute protein intake [p = 0.011]. None of the appetite sensations differed between conditions. Pre-lunch explicit liking for fat decreased on EX compared with CON [p = 0.045], the implicit and explicit wanting for fat [p = 0.047 and p = 0.025 respectively] and explicit wanting for taste [p = 0.012] decreased from pre to post lunch after exercise. Energy Expenditure, fat and carbohydrate oxidation rates during exercise were not associated with subsequent appetitive measurements. Exercise-induced energy expenditure and substrate might not be associated with the short-term control of appetite and energy intake in adolescents with obesity, which remains to be confirmed by further studies evaluating the effect of various exercises inducing specific predominant fuel sources.",

    "abstract": "Ultramarathon running represents an extreme physiological and metabolic challenge. Despite its growing popularity among recreational and competitive runners, evidence-based guidance for nutrition, energy balance, and recovery remains limited. Understanding metabolic response and hormonal regulation during such events is crucial for improving athletes' health and performance. This prospective observational study examined participants of the 2024 TorTour de Ruhr Of the 43 ultra runners (16 women, 27 men), 39 finished the race: 19 participants of the 100 km group, 8 of the 160.9 km group, and 16 of the 230 km group. Mean energy deficit was 6797 kcal (range: 417-18,364 kcal) with carbohydrate-dominant fueling (79%). Significant reductions in leptin and insulin and increases in ghrelin, glucagon, CKM, and LDH were observed, indicating disrupted energy homeostasis and muscle damage. The 230 km subgroup showed the greatest changes. Gastrointestinal and musculoskeletal symptoms increased post-race, aligning with biomarker patterns. Ultramarathon participation induces profound disturbances in metabolic and structural integrity, regardless of race distance. These findings underline the importance of developing individualized nutritional and recovery strategies and highlight the need for future research to investigate how energy deficit and macronutrient composition interact to influence metabolic strain and post-race recovery.",

    "abstract": "Regular participation in some type of physical activity brings improvements in health indicators such as cardiorespiratory fitness, muscle strength, and body composition. However, despite evidence indicating health benefits, 1 in 4 adults is physically inactive, a situation that also occurs in the university population. Walking is a physical activity modality that can be easily incorporated into daily activities; therefore, using a walking-based physical activity intervention could improve some health indicators. This protocol aims to analyze the impact of a walking-based physical activity intervention on health indicators in university students. An intervention group (n=99) and a control group (n=99) will be randomly selected. All participants will be assessed at the beginning and end of the intervention for indicators of health, cardiorespiratory fitness, muscle strength, and body composition. The intervention group will participate in a 14-week walking program with individualized daily goals, self-monitoring, personalized feedback, and weekly educational material, while the control group will only record their steps without receiving personalized goals or feedback. The recruitment process will begin in March 2026. Initial assessments are scheduled to take place from March 2, 2026, to March 13, 2026. The intervention will be performed from March 16, 2026, to June 19, 2026 (14 weeks). From June 22, 2026, to July 6, 2026, the final evaluations will be performed. The final results of this study are expected to be published by October 2026. This protocol proposes a novel and feasible approach to overcome common barriers to physical activity in university students, with the potential for large-scale application in similar contexts.

J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2025-Position-specific differences in body composition in American football players have been established. How the total and regional composition changes from preseason to postseason by position is unknown. Thus, this study examined longitudinal changes in total and regional body composition in NCAA Division I collegiate football players (CFPs) over a competitive season. A total of 188 male CFPs aged 18-23 (20.7 ± 1.6 years) were included. Body composition was measured using dual X-ray absorptiometry at preseason and postseason. Subjects were grouped into defensive backs, defensive linemen, linebackers, offensive linemen, punters/kickers, quarterbacks, running backs, tight ends, and wide receivers. Repeated-measures ANOVA assessed effects of season and position on total and regional body composition, controlling for player participation status. Post hoc pairwise comparisons determined the magnitude, direction, and significance of changes for each position. There were no changes in total or regional measures of body mass, fat mass, or bone mass across the season, except for arm mass. Significant (p < 0.05) decreases in total lean mass (LM), arm LM, leg LM, and gynoid LM were observed in certain position groups. The results of this study confirm that there is a decrease in total LM during a competitive season in CFPs. This study demonstrates that this loss in LM mainly comes from the leg and gynoid regions of the body and occurs across all positions. This information can be used by strength and nutrition staff to develop new strategies to prevent this LM loss during the season.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to investigate the effects of 8 weeks equivalent-volume resistance training (RT) and high-intensity interval training (HIIT) performed within same session or alternated weekly on body composition, cardiorespiratory function, and muscular fitness in young adult males. Twenty-three young adult males were randomly assigned to either the A group (RT and HIIT performed within the same session, n = 11) or the B group (RT and HIIT were alternated weekly, n = 12). Body composition, cardiorespiratory function, and muscular fitness were assessed at baseline (T1), the fifth week (T2), and the ninth week (T3). Baseline differences and training effects were analyzed using independent sample t-tests and repeated measures ANOVA, respectively. No significant group differences were found at baseline (P > 0.05). Post-intervention, body fat percentage, skeletal muscle mass, and thickness significantly improved over time (P < 0.05), but no significant group or interaction effects. Maximum power output significantly increased at T2 and T3 compared to T1 (P < 0.05), while VO₂max, METs, and Maximum Minute Ventilation significantly increased only at T3 compared to T1 (P < 0.05), with no significant group or interaction effects. Both groups showed significant improvements in maximal strength during the intervention (P < 0.05). Endurance repetitions, particularly in the squat exercise, showed significant improvement initially (P < 0.05), followed by a downward trend, and no significant group or interaction effects were found. Concurrent training, whether performed within the same session or alternated weekly, elicited comparable improvements in body composition, cardiorespiratory, and muscular outcomes in young adult males. Both arrangements promoted beneficial adaptations, indicating flexibility in concurrent training design.

    "abstract": "The physical fitness level of Chinese adolescents shows a decreasing trend year by year, which hurts adolescents' physical health and future achievements. The weight-adjusted waist index (WWI), as a new type of index for assessing adolescents' body composition, has received extensive attention in recent years. However, little research has been conducted on the association between WWI and the physical fitness index (PFI) among Chinese adolescents nationwide. In this study, 9204 adolescents aged 13-18 years from different regions of China were assessed for weight, waist circumference, grip strength, standing long jump, sit-up, sit and reach, and 1000/800 m run using stratified whole-cluster random sampling, and a 50 m dash was assessed. WWI and PFI of the participants were derived sequentially. The t-test, Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis H test, Pearson correlation analysis, and curvilinear regression analysis were used to analyze the associations existing between WWI and PFI. The WWI of Chinese adolescents aged 13-18 years was (9.34 ± 1.14) cm/kg; the PFI was - 0.02. Overall, the results of the analysis showed that the differences in PFI between the different WWI groups were statistically significant in the 13-15 and 16-18 age groups (H-value 19.673, 29.177, P-value < 0.001). The highest level of PFI in adolescents was 0.021 when the WWI was 8.2. The association between WWI and PFI among Chinese adolescents aged 13-18 years was characterized by an inverted \"U\" curve, with both lower and higher WWI negatively affecting physical fitness. The effect of WWI on PFI was more pronounced in boys than in girls. In the future, changes in WWI should be considered in the promotion and intervention of physical fitness, to keep WWI in the normal range and promote the improvement of physical fitness.",

Evaluating Army Combat Fitness Test scores: The influence of sleep, nutrition, and body composition in army reserve officers' training corps cadets. J Strength Cond Res 40(2): 218-224, 2026-The U.S. Army's Holistic Health and Fitness (H2F) program highlights the importance of physical, mental, nutritional, spiritual, and sleep domains for optimizing soldier readiness. Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) cadets must meet physical fitness standards, including the Army Combat Fitness Test (ACFT), yet often lack access to H2F resources. This cross-sectional study investigated how lifestyle factors-physical activity (PA), sleep quality, nutritional habits, and fat-free mass (FFM)-influence ACFT performance among Army ROTC cadets. Forty-six cadets (21.6 ± 2.0 years; women = 7) completed validated questionnaires assessing PA (IPAQ), sleep (PSQI), and nutrition (REAP-S), and underwent anthropometric testing. ACFT scores were obtained from the cadre within 30 days of survey completion. Cadets scoring ≥540 on the ACFT demonstrated significantly better sleep quality (PSQI; p < 0.01) and shorter sleep latency than those scoring <540. Backward linear regression identified PSQI as a significant negative predictor of ACFT scores ( β = -0.42, p = 0.007), with REAP-S and FFM showing marginal significance. Correlation analyses revealed small, significant associations between BF%, MVPA, and PSQI. The final regression model explained 22.4% of the variance in ACFT scores. These results emphasize the importance of sleep quality and body composition in cadet performance, suggesting that targeted education and training strategies could improve readiness in ROTC populations. Future programs should consider holistic approaches to cadet wellness, especially without formal H2F support.",

However, the mechanisms behind BCAAs are not well-established, and previous studies have had mostly equivocal results; thus, the possible performance-enhancing effect of BCAAs is controversial. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the current literature on the effect of pure BCAA supplementation on exercise performance and body composition. Randomized controlled trials with healthy participants >18 years old were included. The intervention was pure combined BCAA supplements, and the comparator was a matched control. Studies with outcomes related to exercise performance and/or body composition were eligible. PubMed, Ovid Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar were searched until 15/08/2025. We assessed selection, attrition, performance, detection, attrition, reporting and other biases from low to high risk based on the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews. Twenty-two studies were included with 511 participants in total. Eleven studies had trained athletes, whereas 11 articles had untrained participants. Daily doses ranged from 1.5g to 82g. The age varied from 18 to 71.7 years, whereas the study length varied from one day to six months. One study found significant differences in body composition after BCAA supplementation. There were 13 studies with significant findings for various exercise performance outcomes such as endurance, strength, muscle recovery, speed, and fitness. The results moderately support BCAA reducing muscle soreness; however, there is inconsistent evidence to support BCAAs having an ergogenic effect on strength and endurance. Due to unclear/high risk of bias in several studies, no meta-analysis was performed. In conclusion, BCAA supplementation may reduce muscle soreness post-exercise, but evidence for improvements in strength, endurance, and body composition remains inconsistent. However, future studies should consider improving certain limitations such as implementing incremental doses, strict diets, and enrolling more participants with diverse backgrounds.",

    "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a prevalent digestive disorder, influenced by various factors, particularly dietary choices and overall diet quality. Various indices assess diet quality, yet their correlation with IBD severity and symptoms remains uncertain. This systematic review examines the relationship between IBD and diet quality, as measured by the Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII), Healthy Eating Index (HEI), and Diet Quality Index (DQI). Observational studies investigating the association of DII, HEI, and DQI with IBD risk, severity, symptoms, quality of life, body composition, serum calprotectin, and inflammatory markers were selected without date or geographic restrictions. A systematic search of PubMed and Google Scholar was conducted on February 2024, following PRISMA guidelines. The search yielded 6,995 articles, of which 14 observational studies (comprising 129,465 adults living with IBD) met the inclusion criteria. Seven studies examined DII, five assessed HEI, one analyzed both DII and HEI, and one investigated DQI in people with IBD. Findings suggest that a lower dietary inflammatory load (as indicated by DII) is associated with reduced IBD risk, severity, and symptoms, alongside improved quality of life. However, further studies are needed to clarify the role of DII, HEI, and DQI in managing IBD management.",

    "abstract": "Early identification of children at risk for metabolic syndrome (MetS) can reveal traits linked to cardiometabolic disease. We aimed to develop a simple, user-friendly tool to detect pediatric cardiometabolic risk using clinical, nutritional, and lifestyle data. A total of 317 patients (11.35 ± 3.62) were assessed using clinical, dietary, and biochemical data. Metabolic risk was defined by a MetS z-score >0.75, and MetS diagnosis required at least three altered parameters (body composition, blood pressure, glucose, lipids). A 22-variable binary tool generated a cumulative risk score: ≥7 altered components indicated high risk; otherwise, low risk. A pathological MetS-score was found in 62.15% of subjects, while MetS was diagnosed in 39.4%. The MetS z-score was significantly correlated with MetS prevalence (r = 0.581). When considering a screening tool score ≥7, along with patients presenting at least 3 of 4 altered MetS parameters, the results demonstrated good sensitivity (0.768 [0.715, 0.835]), negative predictive value (0.775 [0.702, 0.848]), and accuracy (0.618 [0.564, 0.672]), though specificity (52.1% [0.420, 0.600]) and positive predictive value (0.511 [0.439, 0.582]) were moderate. A score ≥7 reliably identifies children at cardiometabolic risk, providing a sensitive, non-invasive tool that supports early detection, prevention, and personalized care while reducing time and healthcare costs. Early detection of at-risk children can uncover cardio-metabolic traits. A 22-noninvasive variable tool was developed to identify pediatric cardio-metabolic risk. A score ≥7 effectively identifies children at cardiometabolic risk. The proposed non-invasive tool achieves good sensitivity (76.8%) and moderate specificity (52.1%). The tool supports clinicians in prevention, monitoring, and personalized care.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes, particularly in middle-aged populations. Physical fitness, especially muscular strength and cardiorespiratory capacity, has emerged as a pragmatic indicator of metabolic health. In this cross-sectional study, we investigated the association between multiple fitness components and the presence of MetS in middle-aged adults, with emphasis on weight-normalized indices. A total of 570 middle-aged adults (369 male, 201 female) were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. Assessments included body composition measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis (appendicular skeletal muscle mass, ASM), handgrip strength, isokinetic lower-limb strength at 60°/s using the HUMAC NORM system, and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) assessed by maximal treadmill testing (VO₂max, mL·kg The participants with MetS showed significantly lower relative grip strength, relative lower-limb strength, and VO₂max than their non-MetS counterparts. A lower ASM ratio was also characteristic of MetS. In age-adjusted models, the decreased ASM ratio and lower relative grip strength were associated with higher odds of MetS, with attenuation after additional adjustment for BMI. ROC analysis yielded pragmatic thresholds for identifying MetS: ASM ratio < 24.0% in male individuals and < 20.0% in female individuals; relative grip strength < 53.3 in male individuals and < 38.0 kg/BW in female individuals; relative lower-limb strength < 5.94 in male individuals and < 5.03 Nm/BW in female individuals; and VO₂max < 24.0 in male individuals and < 19.3 mL·kg Weight-normalized fitness indices, particularly the ASM ratio and relative grip strength, are informative for identifying prevalent MetS in middle-aged adults and support sex-specific screening thresholds suitable for clinical and community practice.",

    "abstract": "Short set configurations attenuate cardiovascular responses, reduce perceived exertion and allow for greater mechanical performance compared with longer sets. Mid-term to long-term adaptations to resistance training across set configurations remain unexplored in postmenopausal women. This study will explore cardiovascular, metabolic, neuromuscular and perceptual adaptations to 12-week resistance training programmes differing in set configuration. Forty physically active postmenopausal women will participate. After medical screening, they will complete four pretest assessments measuring cardiovascular, metabolic, neuromuscular and body composition variables. Participants will then be randomly assigned to a control group or one of two experimental groups. Each session, experimental groups will complete 36 repetitions per exercise (leg press, bench press, leg curl and lat pull-down) with a 12-repetition maximum load. The 4S group will complete nine sets of 4 reps with 45 s of rest, while the 9S group will do four sets of 9 reps with 120 s of rest. The intervention will span 12 weeks with 24 training sessions. Afterwards, all participants will repeat the initial assessments. Experimental groups will return 3 months later for follow-up evaluations of cardiovascular, metabolic and body composition outcomes. A 3×3 repeated-measures analysis of variance will be used to analyse the effects of set configuration (4S, 9S, control) over time (pretest, post-test, follow-up). The study was approved by the Galician Regional Government Ethical Committee. All participants will receive detailed oral and written information before providing informed consent.

    "title": "Effect of a Digital Health Physical Activity Program Integrating Gamification for Obesity Management in Comparison With Usual Care: Randomized Controlled Trial With an Ideographic Approach.",
    "abstract": "Digital health interventions and gamification hold promise for managing chronic diseases, but evidence comparing their efficacy, long-term effectiveness, and cost-efficiency with those of usual care is limited. Moreover, there is a growing need for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating digital physical activity interventions to incorporate idiographic approaches and intensive longitudinal assessments that capture individual variability and the dynamic nature of behavior change. This 2-arm parallel RCT with embedded N-of-1 analyses examined whether a digital intervention integrating gamification and telecoaching (Kiplin program) outperformed a supervised, face-to-face, adapted physical activity program (usual care) in improving physical activity, clinical outcomes, and cost-effectiveness among adults with obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D). We randomized (1:1) 50 patients with obesity or T2D (mean age 47.90, SD 12.49 years; 37/50, 74% female) referred to the University Hospital of Clermont-Ferrand, France, to either the Kiplin digital program or the usual care group. Both programs lasted 3 months, with a 6-month follow-up. The Kiplin intervention included 2 face-to-face and 20 online supervised sessions and 3 mobile app games, whereas the control group completed a standard hospital-based adapted physical activity (APA) program with 3 individual face-to-face, supervised sessions per week (36 sessions). The primary outcome was the change in daily step count, measured objectively and continuously via wearable devices from baseline to the end of the intervention. Secondary outcomes included changes in accelerometer-assessed physical activity, quality of life, body composition, physical capacities, and daily steps over 9 months. Program adherence was also evaluated. Mixed-effects models and generative additive models were conducted to analyze both between- and within-person evolutions in physical activity. A cost-utility analysis was computed to compare the cost-effectiveness of the programs. Compared with usual care, Kiplin participants achieved greater increases in daily steps during both the 3-month intervention (+1085 steps/day) and follow-up (+1775 steps/day), with sustained effects over time. Idiographic analyses revealed marked heterogeneity, showing substantial between- and within-person variability, with 9 participants exhibiting nonlinear patterns and divergent individual trajectories, with some participants showing no improvement. No significant group differences were observed in secondary clinical outcomes, except for change in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, in favor of the Kiplin group. Cost-utility analyses showed no significant difference between programs. Kiplin participants attended an average of 14.68 of 22 possible APA sessions and engaged in an average of 2.6 games. In contrast, usual care patients attended an average of 30.27 of 36 APA sessions. This study demonstrates the potential of digital gamified interventions to promote and sustain physical activity, offering an alternative to face-to-face programs. However, individual heterogeneity in the response to the intervention highlights the need for screening tools and tailored approaches. Further large-scale studies are warranted to evaluate the long-term clinical and economic impact of such interventions.",

    "abstract": "Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) is an effective treatment for atrial fibrillation (AF), but many patients remain inactive after the procedure for fear of AF recurrence. Evidence supports moderate exercise to improve outcomes of this procedure; however, there are no clear guidelines for returning to physical exercise after PVI. We aim to evaluate the effects of a combined endurance and resistance training (CT) intervention on cardiac function, physical fitness, activity levels, body composition, quality of life, and AF burden after PVI. We will conduct a randomized controlled trial with 68 participants, approximately 15 months after PVI, randomized 1:1 to a CT or control group. The CT program consists of supervised training sessions combining moderate-intensity endurance and resistance work three times a week for 12 weeks. Outcomes will be assessed at three time points: at baseline, after the intervention, and after 12 weeks of follow-up, including echocardiographic and electrocardiographic parameters, fitness tests, physical activity monitoring, body composition, health-related quality of life, and AF burden monitored by an implantable cardiac Holter. We expect that CT intervention will improve cardiac function, increase physical fitness and activity levels, optimize body composition, and improve quality of life without recurrence of AF. This protocol is the first to examine the effects of return to exercise training in AF patients after PVI using objective monitoring tools. The simplicity and scalability of the intervention support its safe integration into clinical practice to promote physical activity and improve patient outcomes after PVI.",

    "abstract": "Sports injuries (SP-INJ) substantially affect athlete health and team performance, underscoring the need for precise risk assessment in professional football. This study develops and tests an interpretable partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) injury-risk model that integrates the following constructs: body mass index (BMI), mechanical load (ML), training-program structure (TP), context-specific risk factors (RF), warehouse-technology effectiveness (WT), which is supported by Electronic Athlete Information System (EAIS), musculoskeletal development (MD), performance, and SP-INJ. The model integrates continuous WT data with self-reported/contextual measures in a unified framework, demonstrating a scalable, warehouse-backed pipeline for team-level risk stratification. Data were collected from 153 professional football players across multiple leagues worldwide. WT captured workload and physiological signals to derive ML, while questionnaires obtained BMI, TP, RF, MD, Performance, and SP-INJ outcomes. PLS-SEM (two-stage: measurement → structural) was used to test the hypothesised pathways among these constructs. Higher ML and elevated BMI were positively associated with SP-INJ incidence. Well-structured TP and effective WT were negatively associated with injuries. MD and performance mediated the impact of ML and RF. The final model explained 61% of the variance in SP-INJ. Integrating ML metrics with EAIS-supported WT and modelling them within a PLS-SEM framework enables interpretable team-level risk stratification and can inform periodised, targeted prevention strategies in professional football. The cross-sectional design, reliance on BMI as a body-composition proxy, modest sample size, and football-specific data may limit generalisability; future longitudinal, multi-sport validation is warranted.",

    "title": "Sensitivity of body mass index as a current criterion of nutrition: new body mass index redefinition for young adults.",
    "abstract": "Introduction: obesity during university studies is becoming a growing problem. In order to recognize health risks in the young population as early as possible, it is important to define objective criteria for obesity. Body mass index (BMI) and percentage of body fat (PBF) are the most common parameters for assessing obesity. Objective: the aim of this research is to determine the criteria of BMI for young university students as a young adult population based on PBF criteria. Methods: this study included 1272 university students, divided by gender (675 females and 597 males). PBF was measured using multichannel bioelectrical impedance analysis InBody 720. Results: percentile distribution was used to establish obesity criteria for PBF based in four categories: athlete, fit, normally nourished and overweight. The results for female showed that the BMI cut-off value for the athlete criterion is 21.97 kg/m2, for the fit criterion is 22.01 kg/m2, for the normally nourished 23.18 kg/m2 and for the overweight 27.29 kg/m2. The results for male showed that for the athlete criterion the cut-off value for BMI was 23.70 kg/m2, for the fit criterion 25.66 kg/m2, for the normally nourished 26.63 kg/m2 and for the overweight 29.60 kg/m2. Conclusion: the existing standard BMI criteria for young adults are not specifically accurate regarding obesity. We propose to redefine BMI nutritional status criteria based on PBF for young adult subjects. Introducción: la obesidad durante los estudios universitarios se está convirtiendo en un problema creciente. Para reconocer los riesgos de salud de la población joven lo antes posible, es importante definir criterios objetivos para la obesidad. El índice de masa corporal (IMC) y el porcentaje de grasa corporal (PGC) son los parámetros más comunes para evaluar la obesidad. Objetivo: el objetivo de esta investigación es determinar los criterios del IMC para los estudiantes universitarios jóvenes, como población de adultos jóvenes, basados en los criterios del PGC. Métodos: este estudio incluyó a 1272 estudiantes universitarios, divididos por género (675 mujeres y 597 hombres). El PGC se midió utilizando el análisis de impedancia bioeléctrica multicanal InBody 720. Resultados: se utilizó la distribución percentil para establecer los criterios de obesidad del PGC en cuatro categorías: deportista, en forma, normalmente nutrido y con sobrepeso. Los resultados de las mujeres mostraron que el valor de corte del IMC para el criterio de deportista es de 21,97 kg/m2, para el criterio de en forma es de 22,01 kg/m2, para el de normalmente nutrido es de 23,18 kg/m2 y para el de sobrepeso es de 27,29 kg/m2. Los resultados de los hombres mostraron que, para el criterio de deportista, el valor de corte del IMC fue de 23,70 kg/m2, para el de en forma de 25,66 kg/m2, para el de normalmente nutrido de 26,63 kg/m2 y para el de sobrepeso de 29,60 kg/m2. Conclusión: los criterios estándar existentes del IMC para adultos jóvenes no son específicamente precisos en cuanto a la obesidad. Proponemos redefinir los criterios del estado nutricional del IMC basándonos en el PGC de los sujetos adultos jóvenes.",

    "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a multisystem disease primarily affecting the lungs. It impacts physical fitness due to increased bronchial secretions and exercise intolerance. Inspiratory muscle training (IMT) is recommended as a pulmonary rehabilitation approach. Therefore, we aimed to examine the effect of inspiratory muscle training on health-related physical fitness in CF. Articles were searched in five databases from inception to June 2025. All randomized controlled trials comparing IMT with a control group in individuals with cystic fibrosis were included. Four randomized controlled trials involving a total of 90 individuals with CF met the inclusion criteria. A significant difference was found in the change in maximal work capacity, maximal minute ventilation, and exercise duration during the exercise test in the IMT group compared to the control group. However, no significant difference was observed in the change in maximal oxygen uptake, 6-minute walk test distance, and oxygen saturation during the 6-minute walk test between the IMT group and the control group. The therapeutic effectiveness of IMT for physical fitness is still uncertain. The evidence is not enough to assess how IMT can be used to enhance health-related physical fitness in CF. Further research should explore the optimal intensity and duration of IMT training needed to improve cardiorespiratory fitness. Additionally, future studies should evaluate how effective IMT is when examining its impact on health-related physical fitness.

    "abstract": "Health-related fitness (HRF) is essential for wellbeing and daily functioning. While objective fitness assessments are preferred, self-report measures are practical for large-scale or geographically diverse studies. Existing self-report HRF measures may lack sensitivity for younger or healthy adults. Additionally, many include items with no or poorly defined reference populations, potentially limiting their validity and comparability. This study examined the reliability and validity of single-item self-reported HRF measures of aerobic fitness, muscular strength and endurance, flexibility, coordination, agility, and body composition. Between April and July 2023, University of Calgary students and staff (N.=129; mean age 28±9 years) completed the first questionnaire, with subsets completing a second questionnaire and validated fitness assessment. Nine items captured participants' self-rated HRF relative to those of the same age and gender. The nine self-reported HRF items were aggregated to obtain an estimate of overall HRF (Multidimensional Health-Related Fitness Scale, MHFS). We used intraclass correlations (ICC) to estimate test-retest reliability of the individual self-reported HRF items and MHFS. We assessed convergent validity with self-reported leisure physical activity (LPA) and concurrent validity with objective fitness measures using age- and sex-adjusted partial correlations. The single-item self-reported HRF measures (ICC=0.60-0.85) and MHFS (ICC=0.87) had acceptable test-retest reliability. The MHFS also had high internal consistency (Cronbach's α=0.87). Evidence of validity was observed with partial correlations ≥0.30 between self-reported HRF and LPA, and objective fitness measures. The MHFS provides a reliable and valid HRF indicator among younger adult populations.",

    "abstract": "Sarcopenia, a condition characterized by a decrease in muscle mass and strength, is very common in patients with obesity and can be aggravated by bariatric surgery. This can potentially compromise the clinical results of surgery. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of a structured exercise program on the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of individuals with sarcopenia after bariatric surgery, as evaluated by the Sarcopenia Quality of Life (SarQoL) questionnaire. By determining the effectiveness of exercise interventions, this research aims to provide evidence-based recommendations for improving the quality of life in this population. Patients who were candidates for surgery were recruited for the EXPOBAR program and were randomized into experimental and control groups. All participants underwent gastric bypass surgery (RYGB). After surgery, the patients in the intervention group were included in a structured physical exercise program that lasted 16 weeks. This included combined aerobic and resistance exercise. Outcomes, including body composition and physical fitness parameters, were measured before and after the intervention. The baseline characteristics of the participants were not significantly different between the two groups. All patients met the criteria for moderate/severe obesity and the ESPEN/EASO criteria for sarcopenia, namely, reduced muscle strength assessed by grip strength and reduced muscle mass assessed by the ASMM score/weight. After completing the study protocol, patients in both groups had increased HRQoL, but the increase was significantly greater in the intervention group than in the control group. Our findings suggest that exercise is crucial in improving both physical and psychological well-being in post-bariatric patients, highlighting the need to integrate structured exercise programs in post-surgery care. This study is part of a prospective randomized study registered at Clinicaltrials.gov (NCT05289219).",

However, the impact of sarcopenia on these markers, particularly in comparison to non-sarcopenic controls, is understudied. Additionally, the effects of resistance exercise and nutritional support on neurotransmitter levels in sarcopenic patients are largely unknown. This study explores these neurochemical changes and their response to therapeutic interventions. This post hoc analysis of a randomized controlled trial included 57 sarcopenic and 57 non-sarcopenic participants from the same cohort. Grip strength and body composition were measured. Sarcopenic patients received a 12-week intervention involving resistance exercise and supplementation with branched-chain amino acids, calcium, and vitamin D3. Plasma adrenaline, noradrenaline, dopamine, serotonin, and cortisol were assessed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Sarcopenic individuals had significantly lower levels of serotonin (13.28 vs 19.21  ng/mL,  Sarcopenic patients exhibit lower serotonin, adrenaline, and noradrenaline compared to non-sarcopenic controls, with no significant difference in cortisol levels.

    "abstract": "Skeletal muscle serves as the primary source of power for body movement. Due to the transition of menopause, older women experience a relatively faster decline in skeletal muscle mass and function, making them more susceptible to age-related skeletal muscle disorders such as sarcopenia, which can lead to adverse outcomes such as falls, fractures, disability, or even death. Blood flow restriction low-intensity resistance training (LI-BFRT) can effectively enhance muscle strength and promote skeletal muscle growth, while repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has previously been shown to improve motor cortex excitability and limb motor function. We describe a trial protocol to investigate the effects of a 12-week intervention combining rTMS with LI-BFRT on skeletal muscle mass and physical function in community-dwelling postmenopausal women. This single-blind, randomized controlled trial will recruit 54 eligible community-dwelling postmenopausal women aged 50-65 years who have been naturally postmenopausal for 1 year or more. Participants will be randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to the rTMS combined with the blood flow restriction low-intensity resistance training group (rTMS + LI-BFRT), the blood flow restriction low-intensity resistance training group (LI-BFRT), and the control group, respectively, for a 12-week intervention period. Participants will undergo assessments at baseline (Week 0), immediately after the intervention (Week 12), and long-term follow-up (Week 24). The primary outcomes include lower limb muscle mass, muscle strength in both the upper and lower limbs; secondary outcomes include body composition, physical function (5-time sit-to-stand test, 30-second stand test, timed up-and-go test, 30-second arm curl test), motor cortex excitability, and clinical blood markers related to neural and muscular function. We have combined central and peripheral motor activation methods for the first time, attempting to use BFRT in combination with rTMS intervention to recruit more motor units by increasing motor cortex excitability, thereby enhancing skeletal muscle motor ability under BFRT and examining the intervention effects on skeletal muscle mass and strength in postmenopausal women. This will provide a new paradigm for healthy intervention in the skeletal muscles of postmenopausal women. http://www.chictr.org.cn, Chinese Clinical Trial Registry ChiCTR2400086697.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the longitudinal tracking of cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), adiposity, and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) during childhood is essential for developing effective health interventions. Our study evaluated the tracking of objectively measured MVPA, CRF, and adiposity from early to late elementary school age. Participants were recruited through six elementary schools in the Kanto region in Japan. Of the 247 children assessed at baseline in first grade (ages 6-7), 244 participated in a follow-up in fifth grade (ages 10-11). CRF was assessed as peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak, mL·kg⁻¹·min⁻¹) during a progressive treadmill test. Body fat percentage was measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. MVPA was measured using a triaxial accelerometer worn for 14 consecutive days. Spearman rank correlations indicated high tracking of body fat percentage in boys (ρ = 0.65, p <0.001) and girls (ρ = 0.61, p <0.001), and moderate and high tracking of MVPA in boys (ρ = 0.58, p <0.001) and girls (ρ = 0.63, p <0.001). CRF showed moderate tracking in boys (ρ = 0.57, p <0.001), but weaker tracking in girls (ρ = 0.29, p <0.01). Generalized estimating equations analysis adjusted for height revealed significant tracking for all three indicators, with a weaker tracking pattern for CRF in girls compared to boys: body fat percentage (β = 0.89 in boys, 0.79 in girls, both p <0.001), MVPA (β = 0.70 in boys, 0.69 in girls, both p <0.001), and CRF (β = 0.76 in boys, 0.54 in girls, both p <0.001). These findings support the need for targeted approaches during the early school years to prevent the consolidation of unfavorable profiles in fitness, adiposity, and physical activity. In addition, population-wide approaches throughout the school-age years may be important in supporting fitness development in girls, given the greater variability observed in CRF.",

    "abstract": "Sarcopenia is highly prevalent among hospitalized older adults and is associated with poor clinical outcomes. Multiple diagnostic criteria exist, but the comparative implications of different handgrip strength (HGS) thresholds and measurement tools are less explored. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of sarcopenia, comparing the diagnostic yield of different HGS thresholds using two measurement instruments (dynamometer and vigorimeter) in hospitalized older adults. This was a cross-sectional observational study. A tertiary geriatric hospital with acute, rehabilitation, and long-term care wards was included. A total of 376 hospitalized older adults with complete HGS and bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) data were recruited. HGS was measured using both a hydraulic dynamometer and a pneumatic vigorimeter. Sarcopenia was defined using cut-offs from EWGSOP2, SDOC, and two DO-HEALTH-derived thresholds. Low muscle mass was identified using the fat-free mass index (FFMI) by BIA. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify predictors of sarcopenia. The prevalence of probable sarcopenia ranged from 68.1% to 89.4%, and confirmed sarcopenia from 39.6% to 50.3%, depending on the thresholds applied. Sarcopenic patients were older (86.1 ± 9.8 vs. 80.4 ± 11.0 years;  Sarcopenia prevalence was high and varied widely across diagnostic definitions and measurement tools, reflecting both methodological variability and the high vulnerability of hospitalized older adults. These findings highlight the need for standardized, context-adapted diagnostic strategies to guide timely intervention in high-risk hospitalized older adults.",

    "abstract": "Somatotypes describe changes in body structure and allow estimations of biological differences and similarities between subjects. They can also highlight the relationship between body composition and risk factors for worsening health. The study aimed to evaluate lifestyle disease risk in adult men and women based on resting blood pressure and body composition. Somatotyping was used to determine body type as endomorphic, mesomorphic, or ectomorphic. The study used the anthropological measurements of 344 subjects, 179 men and 165 women, to determine somatotype using the Sheldon method. Body composition analysis employed an electrical bioimpedance method, while a sphygmomanometer measured heart rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressure. The study has been explicitly described as a cross-sectional study involving 344 adults aged 18-75 years (mean = 40.8 years), including 179 men (18-73 years, mean = 40.3 years) and 165 women (18-75 years, mean = 41.4 years). Men were more likely to be mesomorphic, and women were more likely to have an endomorphic somatotype. Individuals with a predominantly mesomorphic somatotype had higher total muscle mass. Furthermore, mesomorphs had the highest levels of body composition components (muscle, bone, fat-free mass, and water), and ectomorphs had the lowest. Generally, somatotype components correlated significantly with age, with a greater proportion of endomorphy and mesomorphy in older age groups. Body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference varied in women depending on somatotype. In men, BMI, waist circumference, and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) were also somatotype dependent, with similarly elevated values found in endomorphs and mesomorphs and lower values in ectomorphs. Resting blood pressure was associated with somatotype in women, while ectomorphy was negatively associated with risk factors for disease in older men. Somatotype may provide complementary information to individual measurements for assessing biological risk and predisposition to disease among adults, especially women. As such, somatotype can be considered a useful and appropriate tool for describing health-related characteristics across different populations, including both healthy and diseased individuals.",

    "abstract": "What are the Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) criteria leading to the diagnosis of malnutrition at hospital, specifically in diabetic patients, is not well known. The factors associated with the clinical outcomes of nutritionally at-risk hospitalized patients have been scarcely investigated. To characterize the GLIM-based nutritional phenotype of hospitalized patients managed by a Nutrition Support Teams (NST) (primary), and to compare the GLIM malnutrition diagnostic criteria between diabetic and non-diabetic patients (secondary); to identify the factors associated with hospital readmission one month after discharge and one-month mortality (secondary). We conducted a retrospective observational study including all the consecutive adult patients managed by the NST of a tertiary university hospital. The exclusion criteria were age under 18 yr and absence of assessment of body composition by bioimpedance analysis (BIA). Malnutrition was diagnosed according to the GLIM criteria: the etiologic criterion was the hospitalization for an acute or chronic disease, and three phenotypic criteria were: low body mass index (BMI), weight loss, and/or low fat-free mass index (FFMI) derived from BIA. Food intake was assessed by the Simple Evaluation of Food Intake® (SEFI®). Handgrip strength was measured using a dynamometer. Hospital readmission and death one month after discharge were collected from the electronic medical records (EMR). Multivariable logistic regression analyses using a stepwise top-down selection identified factors associated with one-month hospital readmission and mortality. 231 patients were included: 43 % of females, age (mean ± SD), 62.2 ± 15.9 yr, BMI, 23.5 ± 6.4, 73.6 % (170/231) were malnourished, of whom 66.5 % (113/170) had severe malnutrition, and 20.3 % (47/231) had diabetes. Malnutrition was diagnosed according to the three phenotypic criteria in 59/170 patients (34.7 %), two in 56/170 patients (33.1 %), and only one in 54/170 patients (31.8 %). The diabetic patients were less likely to have a low FFMI (29.8 % (14/47) vs 60.9 % (109/179), P < 0.001) or be malnourished (61.7 % (29/47) vs 76.6 % (141/184), P = 0.04), but more likely to have a low handgrip strength (64.3 % (27/42) vs 45.6 % (68/149), P = 0.03) than non-diabetic patients. Multivariable analyses showed that cancer (odds ratio (OR) = 2.51 [1.17-5.37], P = 0.02) and SEFI® score (OR = 0.89 [95 % confidence interval, 0.79-0.99], P = 0.04) were associated with higher risk of hospital readmission, whereas weight loss (OR = 3.20 [1.26-8.17], P = 0.01) and diabetes (OR = 2.76 [1.10-6.91], P = 0.03) were associated with mortality. One third of patients were diagnosed malnutrition with one phenotypic criterion, suggesting that all the GLIM phenotypic criteria should be used to ensure the diagnosis of malnutrition. The diabetic patients had higher FFMI and lower handgrip strength than non-diabetic patients. In patients managed by NST, low food intake and cancer are associated with hospital readmission, while diabetes and weight loss with early mortality.",

Two hundred seventy participants (122 girls) from the Physical Activity and Nutrition in Children (PANIC) study were analyzed at ages 9.7 ± 0.4 (T1) and 15.8 ± 0.4 years (T2). Multifrequency BIA provided R-PhA (arm, leg). Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) determined total lean mass (LM) and fat mass percentage (%FM).

    "title": "Influence of passive, diet-based, hydration on muscle quantity assessment.",
    "abstract": "This study investigated the impact of passive changes in hydration level on measurements of lean tissue mass (LTM) and muscle morphology. Sixteen healthy participants (13 males, 3 females) completed two testing sessions 24 h apart, including dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), 3D ultrasound imaging of the vastus lateralis (VL), and bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). Participants fasted for 12 h before each session. Hydration was manipulated by assigning participants randomly to either a non-hydrated state, abstaining from fluids until testing, or a hydrated state, consuming water equal to 1.5% of body mass 2 hours prior. Total body water, measured using bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), was lower in the non-hydrated condition (48.6 ± 9.7 kg) than in the hydrated condition (49.0 ± 9.8 kg, p = 0.015). In the hydrated condition, total LTM, measured using DXA, was higher for the full body (60.8 ± 11.8 kg vs. 60.0 ± 11.9 kg, p < 0.001) and the trunk (29.2 ± 5.3 kg vs. 28.6 ± 5.4 kg, p < 0.001). Hydration did not significantly affect LTM in the upper (p = 0.251) or lower limbs (p = 0.298), or the thigh (p = 0.051). Volume (p = 0.105) and cross-sectional area (CSA; p = 0.114) of the VL were also unaffected. Small changes in hydration levels induced passively under temperate conditions may not significantly affect measurements of muscle morphology or limb measurements of LTM. However, monitoring changes in muscle quantity with total LTM may be biased by water intake and trunk hydration if these factors are not controlled. Caution is warranted (e.g., standardisation) when using total LTM to monitor changes in muscle quantity.",

    "title": "Relationship between degree of central adiposity, inflammatory status and risk of sarcopenia in obese children.",
    "abstract": "Childhood obesity is a most prevalent condition worldwide. The accumulation of adipose leads to its infiltration into various organs, including skeletal muscle, which called sarcopenia. Children with sarcopenic-obesity are at an increased risk of developing cardiovascular or metabolic diseases. This study aims to investigate the association between central adipose accumulation and the degree of chronic inflammation on muscle performance in obese children, a topic that has not been studied in Indonesia. This study employed a crosssectional design with consecutive sampling involving obese primary school children aged 7-13 years from Semarang and its surrounding areas who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data collection included anthropometric measurements (waist and hip circumferences, waist-to-hip ratio, muscle mass assessed by bioelectrical impedance analysis/BIA), handgrip strength, three-day dietary recall, and blood biomarkers (CRP and IL-6). Muscle mass was classified as low when skeletal muscle mass adjusted for age and sex (SMMa z-score) was less than -2 SD. Reduced muscle strength was defined as handgrip strength below the 15th percentile (age/sex-specific). Central adiposity was defined as waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) ≥ 0.50 or waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) above the 90th percentile for age and sex. Elevated inflammatory markers were defined as CRP ≥ 3 mg/L and IL-6 > 5 pg/mL. Associations between variables were analyzed using chi-square or Fisher's exact tests, and logistic regression models were applied with a significance level set at α=0.05. Of the 86 children, 84.8% had low muscle mass, 38.4% had reduced muscle strength, and 69.8% demonstrated impaired physical performance. High waistto- height ratio (WHtR) was significantly associated with low muscle mass (p = 0.016) and reduced muscle strength (p = 0.007). High C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were also associated with low muscle mass (p = 0.013). In addition, protein intake was significantly related to muscle mass (p = 0.016). In logistic regression analysis, WHtR was an independent predictor of both reduced strength (OR = 5.324, p = 0.021, 95% CI: 1.280-22.148) and low muscle mass (OR = 0.163, p = 0.011, 95% CI: 0.037-0.714). Although interleukin- 6 (IL-6) was elevated in the majority of children, it did not show a significant association with sarcopenia outcomes. Central adiposity, particularly as measured by WHtR, is a key predictor of sarcopenia in obese children, with significant associations observed with reduced muscle mass and strength. Elevated CRP levels further underscore the role of systemic inflammation in sarcopenia. These findings highlight the need for early identification and targeted interventions to mitigate the adverse effects of sarcopenic obesity in children.",

    "abstract": "The phase angle (PhA), assessed using bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), is becoming increasingly popular as an index of muscle quality associated with various health-related outcomes. This study aimed to clarify the relationship between PhA and sedentary behavior (SB), light physical activity (LPA), and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), which were objectively measured using accelerometers in older adults with disabilities requiring care. We recruited 90 older adults (39 men and 51 women, mean age of 78.7 ± 6.7 years) with disabilities under the long-term care insurance system. Skeletal muscle mass index (SMI) and PhA of the lower limbs were measured using a multifrequency BIA instrument. Daily durations of SB, LPA, and MVPA per day were measured using a triaxial accelerometer. Nutritional status was assessed using the long form of the Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA). The MVPA duration was significantly associated with lower limb PhA after adjusting for age, sex, SB and LPA durations, MNA score, and medical history (p = 0.037), whereas SB and LPA durations were not associated with lower limb PhA. The duration of SB, LPA, and MVPA were not significantly associated with lower limb SMI, whereas the MNA score was. Lower limb PhA, but not lower limb SMI, was associated with MVPA duration, independent of nutritional status and medical history. Enhancing the duration of MVPA is needed to maintain the PhA and prevent further decline in physical function in older adults who require long-term care due to disabilities.",

    "abstract": "Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) causes rapid deterioration of physical function; therefore, understanding the changes in skeletal muscle quantity and quality and identifying associated biomarkers is crucial. Myokines, such as insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) derived from skeletal muscle contraction, are well-established biomarkers of skeletal muscle mass. Therefore, we aimed to clarify the role of circulating myokine dynamics in skeletal muscle degeneration after allo-HSCT. Fifty-three patients who underwent allo-HSCT participated in this single-center prospective cohort study. Serum myokine concentrations were measured, and body composition (skeletal muscle mass index [SMI], extracellular water-to-total body water ratio [ECW/TBW], and phase angle [PhA]) were assessed using bioimpedance analysis (BIA) before and 4- and 8-weeks posttransplantation. Mixed-effect models for repeated measures and Tukey's method were used to analyze the changes in body composition and serum myokine concentrations and their interrelationships. Univariate analysis revealed that all body composition parameters and myokine levels were altered after allo-HSCT. When adjusted for covariates, IGF-1 was significantly associated with the SMI (P = 0.003), ECW/TBW (P < 0.001), and PhA (P = 0.001) over time, whereas myostatin was only associated with the SMI (P = 0.001). No interaction between time and myokine levels was observed. Changes in serum IGF-1 level following allo-HSCT may be associated with adverse alterations in skeletal muscle quality. This biomarker may be useful for guiding interventions aimed at preserving muscle quality and function in these patients.

    "title": "Evaluating bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) as a tool for assessing freshwater fish condition.",
    "abstract": "The nutritional status, or condition, of fish is a key health proxy influencing vital life history processes including migration, reproduction, and recruitment. Numerous morphological, biochemical, and electronic metrics are used to assess fish condition, yet it remains unclear if these metrics are congruent with each other and across species. This study evaluates bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) as a tool for assessing fish condition by comparing it with morphological (e.g. condition index, hepatosomatic index) and biochemical (e.g. percentage and total-body mass compositions of lipid, mineral, protein and water content and bulk C:N ratios in muscle tissue) condition metrics in three native Australian fish species (Macquaria ambigua, Nematalosa erebi, and Percalates novemaculeata) and one invasive species (Cyprinus carpio). Using simple least-squares linear regressions and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), we uncovered that BIA parameters correlated strongly with total-body masses of biochemical components that covary with body size, but showed weaker correlations with percentage compositions of the same components. However, phase angle, a common BIA measure, showed some significant correlations with morphological condition and lipid content, although these relationships were generally weak and species dependent. These findings suggest that BIA can effectively estimate certain physiological parameters, but caution should be applied when interpreting BIA metrics, as their relationship with established indicators of condition may vary. The current study underscores the importance of combining multiple methods to provide a comprehensive understanding of fish condition in freshwater ecosystems, which can be used to provide mechanistic linkages with anthropogenic impacts.",

    "abstract": "Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) often experience various nutritional disorders, leading to increased frailty, morbidity, and mortality. The aim of our study was to explore the impact of dietary habits and physical activity on body composition in non-dialysis CKD patients. This cross-sectional study included 199 non-frail CKD patients (stages 1 - 5) from the University Medical Center Ljubljana. Participants completed a food frequency questionnaire, and anthropometric measurements were collected. Body composition was assessed using bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), and muscle strength was evaluated with handgrip dynamometry. Central obesity was present in 79.9% of participants, and obesity based on body mass index (BMI) was found in 26.6%. Elevated fat mass was observed in 58.3% of patients. Sarcopenia was identified in 1%, and sarcopenic obesity in 0.5%. Based on the Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) criteria, 11.6% of patients were malnourished. Dietary analysis revealed too frequent intake of refined carbohydrates, red meat, and sweets, while intake of fruits and vegetables was not often enough. Dietary habits were suboptimal, with no significant differences between individuals with normal waist circumference and BMI and those with central obesity and elevated BMI. However, a significant difference was observed in physical activity, with those having central obesity engaging in less physical activity. Central obesity was the most prevalent nutritional disorder in non-frail CKD patients that was markedly more prevalent than obesity defined by BMI. Waist circumference was a more sensitive marker of increased fat mass determined with BIA than BMI. Inadequate dietary habits and insufficient physical activity were major contributing factors to the observed nutritional disorders in our CKD patients and call for long-term lifestyle modifications.",

One hundred patients undergoing surgery followed by radiotherapy were assessed at five time points (V0-V4). Nutritional evaluations included body weight, body mass index (BMI), bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), handgrip strength (HGS), serum albumin, and dietary intake. Primary outcomes were mortality 30-day readmissions and mucositis severity. Secondary outcomes included length of hospital stay (LOHS), and radiotherapy compliance. Statistical analyses included repeated-measures ANOVA, chi-square tests, logistic regression, Kaplan-Meier survival curves, and Cox proportional hazards modeling. Significant declines in weight, BMI, fat mass, muscle mass, and HGS occurred throughout treatment (p < 0.01), with the greatest deterioration during radiotherapy. Weight loss > 5% was associated with severe mucositis (p < 0.05), and low muscle mass was associated with longer LOHS (p < 0.05). Hypoalbuminemia (< 3.5 g/dL) predicted higher mortality (41.7% vs. 12.5%) and 30-day readmissions (50.0% vs. 13.6%). Lower albumin and reduced muscle mass showed trends toward poorer survival on Kaplan-Meier analysis; however, these differences did not reach statistical significance. Nutritional deterioration is progressive and clinically significant in oral cavity cancer and directly influences mortality and readmissions. Early identification of at-risk patients and structured, multimodal nutritional surveillance are essential. Standardized primary outcomes and robust statistical modeling strengthen clinical relevance and provide a methodological framework for designing future nutritional intervention trials.",

    "title": "[Iodine and vitamin status, body composition in older persons living in Republic of Sakha (Yakutia)].",
    "abstract": "Optimizing the micronutrient status of older adults is an important component of maintaining healthy longevity. The objective was to study gender and age characteristics of iodine, vitamin A, E, B2 and β-carotene status, as well as indicators of body component composition associated with aging in elderly indigenous people of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia). In the autumn, a one-time examination of the micronutrient status of 53 women and 8 men aged 61-95 years (median - 75 years, indigenous residents of Yakutia) was conducted. The concentration of iodine in daily urine was determined by stripping voltammetry, in blood serum the level of riboflavin (vitamin B2) was determined by the fluorimetric titration with riboflavin-binding apoprotein, retinol (vitamin A), α- and γ-tocopherols (vitamin E), carotenoids (β-carotene) - by reversed-phase HPLC. Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) of body composition was performed using the InBody S10 analyzer. Reduced iodine status (excretion <100 μg/l) was observed in the majority of elderly individuals - 92.5%, vitamin B2 (riboflavin <5 ng/ml) - in 31.9%, vitamin E (α + γ-tocopherols <0.8 mg/dl) - 6.1% and carotenoids (β-carotene <10 μg/dl) - 22.4%. All subjects were provided with vitamin A (retinol >30 μg/dl). Combined deficiency of 3 micronutrients (most often iodine, vitamin B2 and β-carotene) was detected in 14.9% of citizens. In a subgroup of elderly women aged ≥75 years moderate (not mild) iodine deficiency was detected more often than in women 60-74 years old, while vitamin B2 deficiency was detected less often (p<0.05). There was a positive relationship (p<0.05) between the age of women and serum β-carotene level, as well as between the concentration of α-tocopherol, on the one hand, and the levels of γ-tocopherol and β-carotene, on the other. A negative correlation was found between the serum retinol level and some BIA body composition indices: extracellular water component (ECW; -0.466, p=0.002), minerals component (-0.420, p=0.006), bone mineral component (BMC; -0.405, p=0.009), soft lean mass (SLM; -0.408, p=0.008), fat free mass (FFM; -0.433, p=0.005), and skeletal muscle mass (SMM; -0.398, p=0.010). In women with 76.3-110.9 μg/dL serum retinol level (quartile IV), the mass of the ECW, minerals and BMC, SLM, FFM and SMM were significantly lower (p<0.05) than in those examined with retinol levels in the range of 30-63 μg/dL (quartiles I and II). Iodine and vitamin B2 deficiency are most common in elderly indigenous people of Yakutia; iodine deficiency worsens with age. In women aged ≥60 years, elevated serum retinol level (>80 μg/dl) was associated with negative changes in body composition parameters associated with aging. In elderly individuals, serum retinol levels above the upper norm limit should probably be considered as a diagnostically significant marker of increased risk of sarcopenia. The rationale for expanding measures to eliminate deficiency of iodine and B vitamins, and to correct excess vitamin A intake in order to prevent age-related alimentary diseases in elderly people living in Yakutia is substantiated.",

    "abstract": "The global increase in obesity is strongly associated with insulin resistance (IR) and related metabolic impairments. Asprosin (ASP), a glucogenic adipokine induced by fasting, has recently emerged as a potential biomarker of IR and abnormal body composition. However, its physiological role in obesity remains incompletely understood. To evaluate the associations between serum ASP levels, IR indices, oxidative stress markers (OS), liver function and inflammation parameters, and body composition in overweight and obese adults during a standardized 4-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). This cross-sectional study included 150 adults categorized by BMI into three groups: control (CG; BMI < 25 kg/m²), overweight (O1; BMI > 25 kg/m²), and obese (O2; BMI > 30 kg/m²). Participants underwent dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), including visceral adipose tissue quantification, bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), and biochemical assessment. Measurements included serum ASP, C-peptide, HbA1c, lipid profile, total oxidative capacity (TOC), total antioxidative capacity (TAC), liver transaminases (ALT, AST) and C-reactive protein (CRP). IR was assessed using HOMA-IR, QUICKI, Matsuda Index, TyG, and the composite TyG-WHR index as a proxy for hepatic IR. ASP levels were significantly higher in O1 and O2 compared with CG (p < 0.001), and in O2 compared with O1 (p < 0.01). ASP positively correlated with fat mass, TOC, HOMA-IR, TyG, TyG-WHR, ALT, and CRP, and negatively with muscle mass, total body water, resting metabolic rate, QUICKI, and Matsuda Index (p < 0.05). ASP is strongly associated with IR and adverse metabolic profiles in obesity. Its preferential correlation with hepatic IR markers (TyG-WHR, ALT, CRP) and fat mass suggests that ASP may primarily reflect liver-specific metabolic dysfunction rather than peripheral IR. These findings highlight ASP as a promising biomarker and potential therapeutic target in obesity-related metabolic disease.",

Cohort study. Place and Duration of the Study: Department of Pulmonary Disease, Faculty of Medicine, Tokat Gaziosmanpasa University, Totak, Turkiye, from February to August 2022. Sarcopenia rates were compared between the COPD group and the Control group. Patients diagnosed with COPD according to the GOLD 2022 criteria by pulmonologists were included in the COPD group. Volunteers without any neuromuscular and pulmonary disease were included in the Control group. The study included 43 patients with COPD and 40 volunteers without respiratory disease. The incidence rate of sarcopenia was found to be 39.5% in the COPD group. Group E patients had the highest rate of sarcopenia (70%). It was found that the COPD group had lower HGS, as measured by dynamometer, and age and gender-corrected HGS measurements compared with the Control group (p = 0.019 and p = 0.005, respectively). Sarcopenia was found to be higher in the COPD group compared to the Control group. The highest rate was observed in Group E. Sarcopenia should definitely be taken into consideration in the follow-up of COPD patients, and treatment of sarcopenia (nutritional supplement, exercise, and pulmonary rehabilitation etc.) should be evaluated in those patients.

    "abstract": "Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a prevalent pregnancy complication associated with long-term cardiometabolic risk, including metabolic syndrome (MetS). This study aimed to assess differences in body composition and metabolic health 6 years postpartum based on prior GDM diagnosis and to identify body composition cut-off values predictive of MetS. This cross-sectional analysis included 604 women from the prospective St. Carlos Cohort in Spain, who had no subsequent pregnancies and complete body composition data 6 years postpartum. Body composition was assessed using bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), and MetS was diagnosed per harmonized criteria. Statistical analyses included ROC curves to establish diagnostic accuracy and optimal cut-off points. Women with prior GDM had a twofold increased risk of developing MetS (26.6 vs. 14.6%). However, waist circumference or elevated BMI and waist-to-height ratio were not significantly different between groups. ROC analysis identified that body composition parameters, particularly fat mass (FM), visceral fat, and FM/Fat Free Mass ratio, as having high predictive value for MetS, regardless of GDM history (AUC ≥ 0.8). Women with MetS showed significantly higher FM and lower relative muscle mass and function. Diagnostic models showed high negative predictive values (≥90%) for most body composition parameters making them effective for excluding MetS. GDM is a significant predictor of MetS. However, body composition, especially increased adiposity and reduced relative muscle mass, provides valuable clinical insights beyond traditional anthropometric measures in postpartum women. The proposed cut-off values for body composition parameters may serve as effective, non-invasive tools for early MetS detection in postpartum care.",

    "title": "Measuring Muscle Mass in Adults With Intellectual Disabilities: The Reliability and Construct Validity of Calf Circumference.",
    "abstract": "The amount of muscle mass is an important criterion to diagnose sarcopenia. Two feasible methods for measuring muscle mass in adults with intellectual disabilities (ID) are bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) and calf circumference (CC). CC measurements are more accessible, cheaper and easier to use than BIA in adults with ID. This study aimed to investigate the construct validity and intrarater reliability of CC to estimate muscle mass compared to BIA in adults with mild and moderate ID and cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF). This study was part of the PRET study (NTR, NL8382), which examined the effect of Progressive Resistance Exercise Training on cardiovascular risk factors in 36 adults with ID (55.58 years, SD: 12.89). Construct validity was analysed with Pearson's correlations between CC and BIA measurements (skeletal muscle mass [SMM], segmental muscle mass [SegMM] and skeletal muscle index [SMI]). The intrarater reliability was analysed with the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The correlation between CC and SMM was 0.19 (95% CI [-0.16, 0.49]), 0.60 (95% CI [0.33, 0.78]) between CC and SegMM and 0.69 (95% CI [0.47, 0.83]) between CC and SMI. The ICC was 0.94 (95% CI [0.89, 0.97]). The excellent intrarater reliability of CC indicates that CC measurements are reliable within the same assessor for adults with ID and CVRF. However, the use of CC to estimate muscle mass compared to BIA remains questionable.",

    "abstract": "Trunk muscle mass decreases with age; this decrease is reported to be related to physical function and activities of daily living. Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) may be used to effectively evaluate trunk muscle mass as an alternative to conventional measurement methods such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. This scoping review aimed to comprehensively examine existing knowledge on types and frequency of BIA devices and the relationship between trunk muscle mass and clinical outcomes. We systematically reviewed studies involving older adults aged ≥65 years. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases; observational studies (cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional) published between January 2000 and October 2023 were reviewed. Three independent reviewers summarized the BIA device model, BIA frequency, study design, study objectives, and outcomes. In total, 7 of 744 identified studies were reviewed. Most participants included in this review were community-dwelling older adults and older patients with stroke. The main research design was a prospective or retrospective cohort study. In addition, a multi-frequency model was used for the BIA device. Common clinical outcome indicators were physical function (swallowing) and activities of daily living. The findings of this review suggest that BIA is an effective method for evaluating trunk muscle mass in older adults. However, the causal relationship between trunk muscle mass and clinical outcomes is unclear, necessitating the accumulation of more data from additional clinical studies.",

Anthropometric measurements, bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), and serum hormonal profiles were assessed. Body composition parameters, including fat mass (FM), fat-free mass (FFM), muscle mass (MM), bone mass (BM), total body water (TBW), muscle-to-fat mass ratio (MFR), and basal metabolic rate (BMR), were measured using the Tanita MC-780 MA device. Adolescents with gynecomastia exhibited significantly higher trunk fat mass (trunk fat mass: 20.60 ± 9.48 % vs. 17.64 ± 6.61 %, p=0.0462) and hormonal alterations, including reduced follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and free thyroxine (fT4) levels (FSH: 2.7 ± 1.4 vs. 3.5 ± 2.0 IU/L, p=0.0164; fT4 12.4 ± 1.9 vs. 13.1 ± 2.5 p=0.0193).

    "abstract": "Sarcopenia, malnutrition, and frailty frequently coexist in older adults with cancer, adversely affecting treatment tolerance, functional independence, and survival. While comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) is the gold standard for frailty evaluation, its resource-intensive nature limits routine use, and simple tools are needed. This cross-sectional study included 291 patients aged ≥70 years with histologically confirmed cancer, evaluated at a oncology outpatient clinic between January and November 2024. Sarcopenia was defined according to EWGSOP2 criteria: handgrip strength (HGS) and skeletal muscle index (SMI) by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). Nutritional status was assessed with the Mini Nutritional Assessment-Short Form (MNA-SF), and frailty was defined as G8 ≤ 14. Additional measures included SARC-F, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and Geriatric Depression Scale. The median age was 74 years, and 53% were male. Possible sarcopenia was identified in 39.5%, confirmed sarcopenia in 33.7%, severe sarcopenia in 26.8%. Nutritional risk was observed in 66.7%, and frailty in 44.7%. Frailty correlated strongly with nutritional status and moderately with muscle strength and mass. In multivariable analysis, low HGS, low SMI, nutritional risk, and depression independently predicted frailty. ROC analysis showed, G8 with HGS and nutritional assessment improved predictive accuracy. These findings highlight that simple measures enhance frailty detection and may support personalized care.",

    "abstract": "In palliative medicine, accurate prognosis of patients with terminal cancer is crucial. Serum albumin (Alb), transthyretin (TTR), and C-reactive protein (CRP) have been reported to be associated with prognosis. Pancreatic cancer is generally a rapidly progressing disease with an extremely poor prognosis. In the present study, we focused on identifying prognostic factors in patients with terminal pancreatic cancer. Overall, 756 patients with terminal cancer were admitted for palliative care and died during the 3-year period from April 2018; of these, 72 patients with pancreatic cancer (9.5%; excluding those who died within 7 days of admission) were included in the study. In addition to assessing clinical symptoms at admission, blood tests were performed to measure serum Alb (g/dL), TTR (mg/dL), CRP (mg/dL), and tumor markers. Body composition was analyzed using bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA; InBody S10) to determine skeletal muscle mass index (SMI, kg/m The median age was 75 years (range: 33-91 years), with a male-to-female ratio of 37:35. The median survival time was 24 days (range: 7-99 days). After adjusting for age, sex, and performance status as potential confounders, multivariate analysis revealed that CRP (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.0998; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.0248-1.1781;  Patients with terminal pancreatic cancer presented with advanced chronic inflammation at admission in addition to cachexia. Multivariate analysis revealed that serum CRP level and ECW/TBW ratio are independent prognostic factors, suggesting that prognosis in terminal pancreatic cancer is associated with the severity of chronic inflammation and edema. Among clinical symptoms, the degree of depression may also be related to prognosis, indicating that psychological distress should be considered in palliative care assessments.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the relationship between muscle thickness and raw and derived bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) parameters following 12 weeks of resistance training (RT) in older women. Fifty-five older women were assigned to a control group (n = 31) or an RT group (n = 24). Muscle thickness was assessed using B-mode ultrasound, while BIA parameters, including reactance (Xc), resistance (R), phase angle (PhA), intracellular water (ICW), extracellular water (ECW), and total body water (TBW), were measured at 50 kHz. Total and appendicular lean soft tissue (LST) and fat mass were evaluated via dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Muscle thickness and total and appendicular LST increased in the RT group (+2.9% to +6.2%; P < 0.001), whereas muscle thickness decreased in the control group (-4.1%; P < 0.001). Xc, PhA, and ECW also increased in the RT group (+1.6% to +5.8%; P ≤ 0.002) but decreased in the control group (-1.1% to -5.8%; P ≤ 0.022). In the RT group, muscle thickness was positively correlated with Xc, PhA, TBW, and ECW (rrm = 0.40-0.52; P ≤ 0.023), whereas in the control group, muscle thickness correlated only with Xc, R, and PhA (rrm = 0.43-0.46; P ≤ 0.015). Linear mixed models showed that muscle thickness was associated with all raw and derived BIA parameters in the RT group but only with PhA in the control group. Our findings suggest that increases in muscle thickness resulting from a 12-week RT program are synergistically associated with changes in both raw and derived BIA parameters, which may play a crucial role in enhancing cellular health in older women.",

In this observational cross sectional study, apparently healthy boys aged 5-20 years were recruited from schools and community centers in northern India (2019-2023). Testicular volume was measured using Prader's orchidometer, and serum testosterone via chemiluminescence immunoassay. Secondary measures included anthropometry, biochemical markers [luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), vitamin D, albumin], and body composition by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). In a total of 1,022 boys, both testicular volume and serum testosterone levels exhibited significant age-related increases (most marked progression between 11 and 15 years. After adjusting for age, higher testicular volume was significantly associated with increased BMI, LH, FSH, muscle mass, and bone mass (P < 0.001), while no significant association was found with vitamin D or albumin levels. Age-specific centile curves for both parameters were generated using the LMS method. This large-scale study provides age-specific normative reference values for testicular volume and serum testosterone in apparently healthy boys from a single center in northern India. These values are clinically valuable for assessing pubertal progression and managing growth and endocrine disorders in Indian populations.",

    "abstract": "Disease-related malnutrition (DRM) frequently results in loss of muscle mass and function, increasing morbidity and mortality risk. Nutritional ultrasound is a promising, noninvasive tool for assessing muscle composition; however, sex-specific cut-off values for diagnosing myopenia remain unclear. In this retrospective cross-sectional study, we evaluated adult DRM patients using the GLIM criteria. Rectus femoris (RF) ultrasound measurements (thickness, width, cross-sectional area [CSA]) and bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) were obtained. Muscle function was assessed via handgrip strength. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves identified sex-specific ultrasound thresholds for myopenia. Eighty-four patients (mean age: 65.6 years; 57.1% male) were analyzed. Myopenia was present in 53.6% based on low ASMI. Optimal RF thresholds for males were 11.45 mm (thickness), 36.95 mm (width), and 2.92 cm² (CSA); for females, 9.40 mm, 34.55 mm, and 2.30 cm², respectively. Reduced RF values were significantly associated with lower phase angle, body cell mass, and handgrip strength. This study proposes novel, sex-specific ultrasound thresholds for rectus femoris assessment in DRM patients. Findings support ultrasound's role as a noninvasive, accessible method for diagnosing myopenia within a morphofunctional evaluation framework.",

    "abstract": "Sarcopenia, characterized by progressive loss of skeletal muscle mass and function, poses a significant risk to the aging population. This study aimed to validate the efficacy of phase angle (PhA) derived from bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) as a screening tool for sarcopenia in community-dwelling middle-aged and older Korean adults. The study employed a cross-sectional design to assess the association between PhA and sarcopenia. The study was conducted in Busan, South Korea, and included 699 community-dwelling participants aged 50 years and older using a purposive sampling method. Sarcopenia was classified based on the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia 2019 criteria. Participants completed the SARC-F questionnaire, a self-assessment tool for sarcopenia risk. BIA was used to measure PhA, a parameter reflecting body composition. Statistical analyses, including analysis of variance, χ Among 699 participants (78.5% female, mean age 75.7 years), 97 had sarcopenia and 77 had severe sarcopenia. Mean PhA values were lower in those with sarcopenia (men: 5.1, women: 4.6) and severe sarcopenia (men: 4.8, women: 4.3) compared with those without (men: 6.0, women: 5.2). PhA demonstrated superior screening capability for sarcopenia compared with SARC-F scores in both men and women. Optimal PhA cutoff values for detecting severe sarcopenia were 5.35 for men [area under the curve (AUC): 0.767] and 4.75 for women (AUC: 0.816), indicating strong potential for clinical application. The established PhA cutoff values can be integrated into routine health assessments, enabling early detection and targeted interventions that could improve the quality of life of this population.",

    "abstract": "The clinical relevance of temporal muscle thickness (TMT) as a sarcopenia marker remains uncertain. This analysis reevaluates its potential utility and limitations in sarcopenia assessment. TMT was assessed ultrasonographically in 648 individuals (Mean age: 66.5 (range, 22-98) years, Female 51.5 %) and compared with computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) measurements in an opportunistic sample of 68 patients. The study examined relationship between ultrasonographic TMT and various sarcopenia-related metrics, including questionnaires(SARC-F), parameters(handgrip strength [HGS], Ishii score, BIA-derived skeletal muscle mass indexes[SMMI], and phase angle[PhA]), and extremity muscle ultrasonographic indices (Muscle thickness [MT], cross-sectional area [CSA]; fascicle length; pennation angle; for biceps brachii[BB], rectus femoris, vastus lateralis, and gastrocnemius medialis). Additionally, the study explored associations with clinical outcomes, including quality of life, activities of daily living, falls, fatigue, depression, and malnutrition. Longitudinal changes in TMT were also documented in 15 intubated acute stroke patients. Ultrasonographic TMT showed valid correlation with CT and MRI (r = 0.566, p < 0.001 and r = 0.437, p = 0.003, respectively). TMT showed a significant but low-level decrease with aging (r = -0.213, p < 0.001). A moderate correlation was found between TMT and HGS (r = 0.334 for HGS-maximum and r = 0.338 HGS-mean), ultrasonographic BB MT and CSA (r = 0.258 and r = 0.388), ASM (r = 0.344), PhA (r = 0.344). Correlation was absent (r < 0.3) in all other parameters examined. The Youden-J index (range: 0.091-0.408) and ROC-AUC 95 % CI lower limit (range: 0.498-0.670) of TMT thresholds dichotomized according to Ishii score, SARC-F, SPPB, SMMI, Barthel index, fatique, Morse fall scale, MUST, EAT-10 and FOIS did not show sufficient clinical yield. In 15 acute mechanically ventilated stroke patients, a numerical decrease was detected in TMT and temporal fat tissue thickness at the end of the third week (Bonferroni corrected p = 0.065 and 0.084, respectively). Temporal muscle thickness correlates positively with various sarcopenia parameters or muscle ultrasonographic indices, but its potential for clinical utility could not be demonstrated in our study.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of albumin-myosteatosis gauge (AMG) in Caucasian patients with non-metastatic colorectal cancer and to relate AMG with classic bioimpedancemetry (BIA) parameters. This study involved 130 Caucasian patients diagnosed with non-metastasic colorectal cancer. CT scans were analysed at the L3 vertebral level to determine the cross-sectional area of skeletal muscle, skeletal muscle index (SMI), skeletal muscle density(SMD). Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) was employed. Albumin and prealbumin were measured. The albumin-myosteatosis gauge (AMG) was calculated: serum albumin (g/dL) × skeletal muscle density (SMD) in Hounsfield Units (HU). The median age was 69.7 ± 9.7 years, with a range of 57-90 years. Patients with AMG values below the median had significantly reduced serum albumin levels, L3-SMI, SMD, SMI-BIA and phase angle. The patients who died during the follow-up of these 5 years had lower levels of serum albumin, body weight, BMI, SMD, phase angle, reactance, AMG and a higher percentage of low muscle mass according to CT and hospital readmissions. The AMG values were negatively correlated with age and positively with albumin, SMD, L3-SMI, phase angle and reactance. Significant differences in 5-year survival between the AMG groups (low median AMG vs High median AMG) (HR 3.83, IC95 % = 1.10-13.42 and the SMD groups (HR 3.57, IC95 % = 1.01-12.58) were observed. AMG was identified as an independent prognostic factor for survival (HR 4.83, 95%CI = 1.21-19.17) CONCLUSION: AMG may function as an independent prognostic marker in Caucasian patients with non-metastatic CRC.",

    "abstract": "Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) may reduce spinal mobility and affect muscle quantity and quality, increasing sarcopenia risk. However, longitudinal data are limited. We investigated muscle quantity, quality, and their changes in DISH using computed tomography (CT) and bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). We analysed health screening data including participants who underwent CT and BIA twice over five years. We identified 143 DISH patients (58.0 ± 8.4 years, 19 females) and 143 age- and sex-matched controls (58.4 ± 8.8 years, 19 females). At L3, psoas and posterior paraspinal muscle (PSM) areas were measured on CT and normalized to height squared as muscle index (MI, cm2/m2). Muscle density was assessed in Hounsfield units (HU). Skeletal muscle mass index (SMI, kg/m2) was obtained from BIA. At baseline, DISH had higher MI (psoas: 347.5 ± 86.0 versus 294.8 ± 81.7, p < 0.001; PSM: 809.3 ± 146.2 versus 758.8 ± 130.7, p = 0.002) but lower HU (psoas: 36.0 ± 9.1 versus 40.9 ± 5.2, p < 0.001; PSM: 39.0 ± 8.8 versus 42.0 ± 7.4, p = 0.002). SMI was similar (7.9 ± 0.9 versus 7.7 ± 0.9, p = 0.212).

We examined the muscle mass and PhA in the extremities of 1199 healthy 8-year-olds (604 males and 595 females) from large cohort study targeting children conducted in Japan. Muscle mass and PhA were measured in each limb by using a BIA device and the limb asymmetry of these body compositions was assessed. The muscle mass and PhA were significantly higher in the dominant upper limbs. In the lower limbs, muscle mass was greater on the right side in both sexes, whereas the PhA showed no significant asymmetry in males and was higher on the left side in females. The degree of asymmetry in the PhA was greater than that in muscle mass, especially in the upper limbs. These results provide a standard reference for asymmetry in muscle mass and PhA in the extremities for this age group.

    "abstract": "We investigated the prospective association between morphological muscle quality indicators-phase angle (PhA) and the extracellular to intracellular water (ECW/ICW) ratio-and all-cause mortality in community-dwelling older adults over a 12-year period by comparing them with traditional body composition and performing physical function tests. This longitudinal study included a total of 868 older adults aged ≥65 years who underwent examinations from 2011 to 2019, and mortality data were monitored through to 2023 using the city's municipal database. Body composition was measured using multi-frequency bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) to assess whole-body and leg PhA, ECW/ICW resistance ratio (morphological muscle quality), appendicular lean muscle mass index (ALMI), leg SMI, and fat mass percentage (fat%) (body quantity). Physical function was evaluated using hand grip strength, a 5-m habitual walk (5-m walk), and a 5-repetition sit-to-stand test (chair stand). We performed Cox regression analysis to examine the prospective association of BIA and physical function variables with all-cause mortality and applied restricted cubic splines to reveal the dose-response relationship between them. The adjusted Cox model showed significant associations between lower leg PhA (hazard ratio [HR] 0.79, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0.64-0.97), leg ECW/ICW resistance ratio (HR: 0.79, 95 % CI: 0.64-0.98), slower 5-m walk time (HR: 0.79, 95 % CI: 0.69-0.90), and longer chair stands time (HR: 0.87, 95 % CI: 0.76-0.999) and mortality (to allow for comparison, all variables were standardized into z-scores, where higher values consistently indicated better results). A dose-response relationship indicated a higher risk for individuals with values below the median in restricted cubic splines. No associations were found between ALMI, fat%, hand grip strength, and mortality. Muscle quality, particularly leg PhA and ECW/ICW ratio, and physical function tests are key predictors of mortality in community-dwelling older adults.",

The aim of the study is to analyze the consistency of estimates of absolute values of fat and lean body mass, as well as the proportion of body fat mass, obtained using bioimpedance analyzers ABC-02 «Medas» (STC Medas, Russia), 770InBody (InBody, Korea) and ultrasound scanner BodyMetrix BX2000 (IntelaMetrix, USA) in a group of men and women. An observational, single-center, cross-sectional, uncontrolled study was conducted. The main anthropometric characteristics (height and weight, waist circumference) were measured. Body composition was determined by bioimpedancemetry (BIA) using the octopolar scheme on the 770InBody device and the tetrapolar scheme on the ABC-02 Medass device and ultrasound scanning using the BodyMetrix BX2000 (BM) ultrasound scanner. The absolute (FM) and relative amount of body fat (PBF) and lean body mass were calculated. A total of 48 people (38 women and 10 men) aged 24 to 74 years were examined. The anthropometric characteristics of the examined subjects were presented in a wide range. A strong correlation was found for all pairs of body composition components: the minimum value for the pair PBF ABC-BM was 0.853 [0.730, 0.913], the maximum was 0.988 [0.977, 0.993] for the pair FM ABC-InBody. Also, significant statistical differences (p&lt;0.001) were found for all pairs of measurements, except for PBF determined by the BIA method. High agreement (CCC&gt;0.95) of BIA estimates of the absolute amount of fat mass was shown, moderate agreement (CCC 0.9-0.95) is characteristic of the PBF determined by different BIA analyzers, and for all other pairs the agreement of measurements can be assessed as weak (CCC&lt;0.90). The best agreement at the group and individual levels was found for FM estimates by two different BIA analyzers (InBody and ABC). BACKGROUND: Determination of body composition components — muscle and fat mass — is an important step in clinical and epidemiological studies. The most common methods for quantitative determination of body composition are indirect methods. However, the variety of methods and models of devices used makes direct comparison of data at both group and individual levels difficult. AIM: The aim of the study is to analyze the consistency of estimates of absolute values of fat and lean body mass, as well as the proportion of body fat mass, obtained using bioimpedance analyzers ABC-02 «Medas» (STC Medas, Russia), 770InBody (InBody, Korea) and ultrasound scanner BodyMetrix BX2000 (IntelaMetrix, USA) in a group of men and women. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An observational, single-center, cross-sectional, uncontrolled study was conducted. The main anthropometric characteristics (height and weight, waist circumference) were measured. Body composition was determined by bioimpedancemetry (BIA) using the octopolar scheme on the 770InBody device and the tetrapolar scheme on the ABC-02 Medass device and ultrasound scanning using the BodyMetrix BX2000 (BM) ultrasound scanner. The absolute (FM) and relative amount of body fat (PBF) and lean body mass were calculated. RESULTS: A total of 48 people (38 women and 10 men) aged 24 to 74 years were examined. The anthropometric characteristics of the examined subjects were presented in a wide range. A strong correlation was found for all pairs of body composition components: the minimum value for the pair PBF ABC-BM was 0.853 [0.730, 0.913], the maximum was 0.988 [0.977, 0.993] for the pair FM ABC-InBody. Also, significant statistical differences (p<0.001) were found for all pairs of measurements, except for PBF determined by the BIA method. High agreement (CCC>0.95) of BIA estimates of the absolute amount of fat mass was shown, moderate agreement (CCC 0.9–0.95) is characteristic of the PBF determined by different BIA analyzers, and for all other pairs the agreement of measurements can be assessed as weak (CCC<0.90). CONCLUSION: The best agreement at the group and individual levels was found for FM estimates by two different BIA analyzers (InBody and ABC).",

    "title": "Case Report: Anthropometric profile and weight control strategies in a world boxing champion.",
    "abstract": "This case study aims to examine the anthropometric profile and body composition management of a Mexican featherweight world champion during key preparatory periods leading up to the World Boxing Organization (WBO) title fight. Special emphasis is placed on the strategic role of nutritional periodization in achieving optimal body composition while preserving performance capacity in a body mass-restricted, high-performance setting. Anthropometric evaluations and octopolar bioelectrical impedance (BIA) measurements were conducted to assess body composition. The Heath and Carter somatotypes were calculated, complemented by proportionality analysis via the Phantom model of Ross and Wilson. Energy availability (EA) was estimated on the basis of fat-free mass (FFM) obtained via BIA, energy intake was recorded with the Automated Self-Administered 24-Hour (ASA24) Dietary Assessment Tool, and exercise energy expenditure was estimated through heart rate monitoring via the Hilloskorpi method. The boxer presented low body fat levels (7.0% by BIA, sum of eight skinfolds = 45.0 mm) and high muscle mass percentages (53.1% by BIA and 46.6% by anthropometry). His somatotype was mesomorphic ectomorphic (1.5-2.8-5.2), with favorable body proportions, including a high relative span and ponderal index, alongside low cormic and adipose/muscular indices. Through nutritional periodization, a total body mass reduction of 6.85 kg was observed, including an acute loss of 5.35 kg (8.56%) during the final 10 days. Energy availability ranged from 35.7 kcal/kg FFM/day at the start of the preparation to 8.8 kcal/kg FFM/day in the final week before the fight. This case study highlights the relevance of regular monitoring of body composition through anthropometry and BIA assessment, combined with nutritional periodization, in supporting athlete preparation. Although very low energy availability was estimated during the final weeks, which should be carefully considered, the findings offer practical insights for body mass management strategies in elite boxing.",

    "title": "Peripheral Thyroid Hormone Sensitivity Mediates the Association Between Body Composition and Diabetes in Euthyroid Adults.",
    "abstract": "Body composition parameters, including fat-to-muscle ratio (FMR) and appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM), are closely associated with metabolic diseases. However, the mediating role of peripheral thyroid hormone sensitivity, reflected by the free triiodothyronine-to-free thyroxine ratio (FT3/FT4 ratio), in these associations remains unclear in euthyroid individuals. The current study aimed to investigate the associations of FMR and ASM/BMI with diabetes and to explore the potential mediating role of FT3/FT4 ratio in these relationships among euthyroid Chinese adults. This cross-sectional study enrolled the participants from 10 communities in Guangdong Province, China, from November 2021 to September 2022. Body composition was measured using bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). Diabetes was defined based on fasting plasma glucose, 2-h postload glucose or glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c). Associations of FMR and ASM adjusted for body mass index (ASM/BMI) with diabetes were assessed using multivariable logistic regression. Structural equation modelling was applied to evaluate the mediating effect of FT3/FT4 ratio. A total of 5089 participants (mean age = 46 years, SD = 12) were included in the final analysis, consisting of 1957 men (38.5%) and 3132 women (61.5%). Participants in the third tertile (T3) of FMR exhibited a 79% higher prevalence of diabetes compared to those in the first tertile (T1) (OR 1.79, 95% CI 1.27-2.54) (p < 0.05). Conversely, those in the T3 of ASM/BMI had a 56% lower prevalence of diabetes compared to participants in T1 (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.31-0.64) (p < 0.05). Restricted cubic spline analysis confirmed linear associations for both FMR and ASM/BMI with diabetes (both p for overall < 0.001; p for non-linear > 0.05). FT3/FT4 ratio significantly mediated the association between ASM/BMI and diabetes, accounting for 4.6% of the total effect (p < 0.05), whereas no significant mediation was observed in the FMR-diabetes pathway (p > 0.05). In euthyroid individuals, higher FMR and lower ASM/BMI were independently associated with increased diabetes prevalence. The inverse relationship between ASM/BMI and diabetes may be partially mediated by FT3/FT4 ratio, highlighting peripheral thyroid hormone sensitivity as a potential mechanistic biomarker linking ASM loss to glycaemic dysregulation in euthyroid individuals.",

    "abstract": "This study explores how relative skeletal muscle mass is associated with the development of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and the remission of baseline MASLD in a community-based population cohort. The study included 1,544 participants with an average age of 58 years. All participants underwent baseline and follow-up assessments in 2015 or 2016. Appendicular skeletal muscle mass was measured using an automatic bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), and total skeletal muscle mass was calculated using the BIA equation. Relative skeletal muscle mass was evaluated in two ways: divided by weight and divided by visceral fat area (VFA). Liver fat content was assessed using ultrasonography, and the NAFLD fibrosis score was calculated to quantify the degree of liver fibrosis. During a median follow-up of 2.1 years, each one-standard deviation increase in relative total skeletal muscle mass was associated with a decreased risk of MASLD incidence among males (hazard ratio [HR], 0.56; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.43 to 0.74, adjusted for weight; and HR, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.13 to 0.42, adjusted for VFA) and females (HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.47 to 0.83, adjusted for weight; and HR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.19 to 0.70, adjusted for VFA). In both sexes, the increase in relative appendicular skeletal muscle mass was also associated with a reduced MASLD risk. We found statistically significant inverse associations between relative skeletal muscle mass and both liver fat content and liver fibrosis. Low relative muscle mass is associated with an increased risk of MASLD incidence and persistence. Therefore, increasing skeletal muscle mass over time might aid in the prevention and management of MASLD.",

    "abstract": "Patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) often have multiple comorbidities and are vulnerable to minor stressors that frequently result in hospitalization. Recent advances have enabled the easy estimation of body composition in clinical settings. This study retrospectively investigated changes in body composition associated with hospitalization in patients receiving MHD. Body composition was measured every 6 months using a multifrequency bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) device in outpatients with MHD. Hospitalization events lasting >24 h were reviewed throughout the follow-up period. Overall, 166 patients (94 men [56.6%]) underwent 904 BIA measurements. A higher baseline extracellular water to total body water ratio (ECW/TBW) and lower phase angle (PhA) were associated with increased hospitalization risk. During the study period, 272 hospitalizations were recorded. Compared with those without hospitalization, hospitalized patients showed progressive declines in fat-free mass index, skeletal muscle mass index, and PhA, along with an increase in ECW/TBW. These trends were consistent across subgroups based on the number and duration of hospitalizations; however, an increase in visceral fat area was observed in patients with four or more hospitalizations. Among the 89 patients who were hospitalized between measurements, body composition was compared pre- and post-hospitalization, with the results revealing significant decreases in body mass index, percent body fat, and PhA, and an increase in ECW/TBW. Body composition is closely associated with hospitalization in patients undergoing MHD. Efforts to maintain euvolemic status and active interventions such as nutritional support and rehabilitation therapy may be essential to preserve a favorable body composition in this vulnerable population.

    "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the relationship between truncal muscle mass, particularly the skeletal truncal muscle mass index (sTMI), and overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms in adult men, using bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). We retrospectively analyzed health screening data from 5,475 men aged ≥40 years collected between 2014 and 2022. OAB was defined as an OAB Symptom Score (OABSS) ≥3 and urgency score ≥2, with moderate-to-severe OAB defined as OABSS ≥6 and urgency score ≥2. Body composition metrics, including fat-free mass (FFM), total muscle mass (TMM), and truncal muscle mass (whole and skeletal), were measured via BIA. The sTMI was calculated by dividing skeletal truncal muscle mass by body mass index (BMI). Logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were conducted to assess predictors of OAB. The overall OAB prevalence was 10.6%. In univariate analysis, FFM (odds ratio [OR] 0.983, p=0.013), TMM (OR 0.982, p=0.010), and sTMI (OR 0.447, p=0.025) were inversely associated with OAB symptoms. However, in multivariate analysis, only sTMI remained a significant independent predictor of moderate-to-severe OAB (OR 0.486, p=0.036). ROC analysis showed that sTMI had better predictive performance for severe OAB (area under the curve [AUC] 0.721) compared to age (AUC 0.706). sTMI, a BIA-based index reflecting truncal skeletal muscle normalized to BMI, is an independent predictor of moderate-to-severe OAB in men. This suggests a potential role of muscle composition in OAB pathophysiology and risk stratification.",

    "abstract": "Liver steatosis can be measured with ultrasound techniques such as the controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) on an equipped FibroScan. For more widespread screening and quantitative evaluation of liver steatosis, a predictive model using body composition data obtained by body bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) was developed. In the training cohort including 365 patients suspected of having metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, a stepwise selection method was used to determine the BIA-related variables associated with CAP. Using the significant variables, a predictive formula was developed, and the estimated CAP (eCAP) was obtained. The diagnostic performance of eCAP was tested to predict liver steatosis with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis in the training, validation (n = 408) and liver biopsy (n = 158) cohorts. The body fat mass of the trunk, skeletal muscle index and age were significant variables associated with CAP. eCAP was obtained as 219.1 - 0.4479 × age + 3.476 × BFM of trunk + 7.045 × SMI. The area under the ROC curve was 0.814 in the training cohort and 0.808 in the validation cohort. The sensitivity and specificity were 72.5% and 82.1% with a cut-off value of eCAP = 281 dB/m. For sensitivity ≥ 90%, the cut-off of eCAP was 266 dB/m. In the liver biopsy cohort, the presence of pathological steatosis was predicted with eCAP as an area under the ROC curve = 0.826, which was not statistically different from CAP (0.871). Completely non-invasive BIA-based eCAP could predict liver steatosis.",

    "abstract": "Sarcopenia refers to a disorder involving the gradual and overall reduction in skeletal muscle mass and physical capability. It occurs in over one-third of individuals with liver cirrhosis and serves as an independent predictor of increased mortality risk. Assessment of sarcopenia is necessary in all patients with liver cirrhosis, as recommended by the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) and the European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN). The evaluation of muscle mass can be performed using several validated methods such as the multislice computed tomography (MSCT), abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), or muscle ultrasound. Assessment of muscle function encompasses measurements of both muscle strength and physical performance. Sarcopenia has a significant negative impact on the course of the disease, quality of life and outcomes of patients with liver cirrhosis. Considering the global healthcare impact and the significant influence on the course of disease, characteristics of simplicity, swiftness, safety, availability, reproducibility, and diagnostic accuracy are certainly the key factors to consider when choosing the proper diagnostic method for nutritional assessment. The aim of this review is to analyze the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying muscle mass loss in patients with liver cirrhosis, as well as to assess strengths and limitations of the methods currently in use to diagnose sarcopenia.",

Traditional anthropometric measures such as body mass index (BMI) have limitations in differentiating between fat and lean mass. This study aimed to evaluate and compare the performance of various supervised machine learning algorithms in classifying obesity levels using anthropometric indices derived from bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). A cross-sectional study was conducted on a sample of 5372 adults (age 34.6 ± 10.0 years) (2727 females and 2645 males). Anthropometric data included BMI, fat mass index (FMI), fat-free mass index (FFMI), skeletal muscle index (SMI), muscle mass index (MM), and others were collected using a validated multifrequency octopolar BIA device (InBody 270). Six supervised machine learning models, random forest, gradient koosting, k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, support vector machine, and decision tree, were trained and evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC), and SHapley Additive exPlanations value explanations. Random forest outperformed all other models, achieving the highest accuracy (84.2%), F1-score (83.7%), and AUC-ROC (0.947). SHapley Additive exPlanations analysis revealed that FMI, FFMI, and BMI were the most influential features, while sex had minimal predictive impact. Machine learning models, particularly tree-based algorithms like random forest, show great potential in classifying obesity levels from anthropometric data with high accuracy and interpretability. These models can enhance the effectiveness of obesity screening in clinical and community settings.",

    "title": "Muscle strength and mass as predictors of pancreatic cancer: insights from the UK biobank.",
    "abstract": "While sarcopenia is associated with adverse pancreatic cancer (PC) outcomes, prospective evidence linking muscle health to PC risk remains limited. This study aimed to prospectively investigate the associations of grip strength and muscle mass with incident PC risk in the UK Biobank cohort. Among 363,693 UK Biobank participants, grip strength (kg) and bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA)-derived muscle mass (weight-normalized) were measured. Cox proportional hazards models, adjusted for age, sex, lifestyle factors, and metabolic syndrome components, assessed PC risk over a median 13.7-year follow-up. Higher muscle mass (HR = 0.86, 95% Confidential Interval [CI]:0.78-0.95) and grip strength (HR = 0.90, 95% CI:0.83-0.98) demonstrated linear inverse associations with PC risk showing sex-specific divergence: muscle mass reduction conferred stronger protection in men (HR = 0.84, 95% CI:0.74-0.96), whereas grip strength showed greater impact in women (HR = 0.84, 95% CI:0.74-0.96). Subgroup analyses revealed that improved grip strength reduced PC risk in diabetics (HR = 0.89, 95% CI:0.80-0.99), while obese individuals benefited from both enhanced grip strength (HR = 0.95, 95% CI:0.90-0.99) and muscle mass (HR = 0.88, 95% CI:0.82-0.94). Population-attributable fraction estimates suggest 5-12% of PC cases could be prevented through muscle health interventions. These findings highlight an association between improved physical capability and reduced PC risk, supporting the adoption of sex-specific preventive strategies-prioritizing muscle mass augmentation in men and grip strength enhancement in women, particularly in high-risk metabolic subgroups. By characterizing sarcopenia as an independent risk factor, this study underscores the imperative to integrate muscle preservation into pancreatic cancer prevention paradigms.",

    "title": "Prevalence and characteristics of sarcopenic obesity and normal weight obesity in Chinese women: a cross-sectional study based on body fat percentage.",
    "abstract": "To investigate the prevalence and characteristics of normal weight obesity (NWO) and its coexistence with sarcopenia among Chinese women, and to evaluate the diagnostic utility of common anthropometric and body composition indicators-including body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), and body fat percentage (BF%) assessed via bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). A total of 1,530 female participants undergoing routine health check-ups at Zhongshan Boai Hospital between January 2022 and December 2023 were enrolled. Anthropometric data including height, weight, WC, and hip circumference were recorded. BIA was used to measure BF% and skeletal muscle index (SMI), along with assessments of handgrip strength and 6-meter gait speed to evaluate muscle function. Participants were classified as having obesity according to the Chinese Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Obesity (2024 edition) and the WHO Asia-Pacific criteria. Sarcopenia was defined according to the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia (AWGS) 2019 guidelines. The UpSet plot was used to visualize diagnostic overlaps among obesity-related indicators, highlighting high-risk phenotypes potentially missed by relying on BMI alone. Among the 1,530 participants, only 145 (9.48%) met the BMI criterion for obesity (BMI ≥ 28 kg/m²), while 1,072 (70.07%) had elevated body fat percentage (BF% >30%), indicating a higher prevalence of hidden obesity. A total of 483 (31.57%) were classified as NWO, including 390 (25.50%) with pre-sarcopenia and 57 (3.73%) with sarcopenic NWO. The UpSet plot revealed substantial diagnostic overlap among BF%, WHR, WHtR, and WC, while BMI had the lowest detection concordance. These findings indicate that combined use of multiple indicators greatly improves the identification of hidden obesity, while BMI alone may lead to significant underdiagnosis. NWO and sarcopenic NWO are prevalent among Chinese women. Reliance on BMI alone underestimates the actual burden of obesity. Clinical assessments should incorporate both body composition and fat distribution indicators to better identify high-risk individuals and improve the precision of metabolic disease prevention and intervention strategies.",
