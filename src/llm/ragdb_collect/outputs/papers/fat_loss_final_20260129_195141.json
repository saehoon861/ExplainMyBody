    "title": "Nutritional Management in Chronic Pancreatitis: From Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency to Precision Therapy.",
    "abstract": "Chronic pancreatitis (CP) precipitates complex malnutrition through synergistic mechanisms: exocrine pancreatic insufficiency-driven maldigestion, duodenal or pancreatobiliary strictures limiting nutrient flow, cholestasis impairing micelle formation, alcohol-related anorexia, pain-induced hypophagia, proteolytic catabolism from type 3c diabetes, and a chronic inflammatory milieu that accelerates sarcopenia and bone demineralisation. Consequent calorie-protein depletion, micronutrient and fat-soluble vitamin deficits, and metabolic derangements markedly amplify morbidity. Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) with targeted micronutrient repletion is foundational; high-protein regimens co-administered with PERT curb muscle loss, and medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) can augment caloric delivery by bypassing lipase dependence, although their benefit over personalised dietetic counselling is marginal. Optimal dietary fat thresholds and timing of escalation from oral to enteral or parenteral feeding remain unresolved. Comprehensive care also demands alcohol abstinence, effective analgesia and stringent glycaemic control. Serial monitoring-biochemical indices, densitometry, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and imaging-based body-composition metrics-permits early detection of high-risk patients and precision tailoring of interventions. Intensified multidisciplinary programmes already improve prognostic endpoints and are unveiling biomarkers of nutritional resilience. A structured, evidence-based strategy integrating PERT, macronutrient engineering, micronutrient repletion and metabolic surveillance is essential to mitigate nutrition-related morbidity, enhance long-term outcomes and optimise quality of life in CP.",

    "title": "Antibody blockade of activin type II receptors preserves skeletal muscle mass and enhances fat loss during GLP-1 receptor agonism.",
    "abstract": "Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists reduce food intake, producing remarkable weight loss in overweight and obese individuals. While much of this weight loss is fat mass, there is also a loss of lean mass, similar to other approaches that induce calorie deficit. Targeting signaling pathways that regulate skeletal muscle hypertrophy is a promising avenue to preserve lean mass and modulate body composition. Myostatin and Activin A are TGFβ-like ligands that signal via the activin type II receptors (ActRII) to antagonize muscle growth. Pre-clinical and clinical studies demonstrate that ActRII blockade induces skeletal muscle hypertrophy and reduces fat mass. In this manuscript, we test the hypothesis that combined ActRII blockade and GLP-1 receptor agonism will preserve muscle mass, leading to improvements in skeletomuscular and metabolic function and enhanced fat loss. In this study, we explore the therapeutic potential of bimagrumab, a monoclonal antibody against ActRII, to modify body composition alone and during weight loss induced by GLP-1 receptor agonist semaglutide in diet-induced obese mice. Mechanistically, we define the specific role of the anabolic kinase Akt in mediating the hypertrophic muscle effects of ActRII inhibition in vivo. Treatment of obese mice with bimagrumab induced a ∼10 % increase in lean mass while simultaneously decreasing fat mass. Daily treatment of obese mice with semaglutide potently decreased body weight; this included a significant decrease in both muscle and fat mass. Combination treatment with bimagrumab and semaglutide led to superior fat mass loss while simultaneously preserving lean mass despite reduced food intake. Treatment with both drugs was associated with improved metabolic outcomes, and increased lean mass was associated with improved exercise performance. Deletion of both Akt isoforms in skeletal muscle modestly reduced, but did not prevent, muscle hypertrophy driven by ActRII inhibition. Collectively, these data demonstrate that blockade of ActRII signaling improves body composition and metabolic parameters during calorie deficit driven by GLP-1 receptor agonism and demonstrate the existence of Akt-independent pathways supporting muscle hypertrophy in the absence of ActRII signaling.",

    "abstract": "This study tested the hypothesis that treatment with the glucagon-like peptide-1/glucagon receptor agonist SAR425899 would lead to a smaller decrease in sleeping metabolic rate (SMR; kilocalories/day) than expected from the loss of lean and fat mass (metabolic adaptation). This Phase 1b, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study was conducted at two centers in inpatient metabolic wards. Thirty-five healthy males and females with overweight and obesity (age = 36.5 ± 7.1 years) were randomized to a calorie-reduced diet (-1000 kcal/d) and escalating doses (0.06-0.2 mg/d) of SAR425899 (n = 17) or placebo (n = 18) for 19 days. SMR was measured by whole-room calorimetry. Both groups lost weight (-3.68 ± 1.37 kg placebo; -4.83 ± 1.44 kg SAR425899). Those treated with SAR425899 lost more weight, fat mass, and fat free mass (p < 0.05) owing to a greater achieved energy deficit than planned. The SAR425899 group had a smaller reduction in body composition-adjusted SMR (p = 0.002) as compared with placebo, but not 24-hour energy expenditure. Fat oxidation and ketogenesis increased in both groups, with significantly greater increases with SAR425899 (p < 0.05). SAR425899 led to reduced selective metabolic adaptation and increased lipid oxidation, which are believed to be beneficial for weight loss and weight-loss maintenance.",

Aim of this study is to evaluate BC changes made by a lifestyle intervention in a randomized homogeneous sample of two groups with equal daily caloric reduction but different protein distributions between meals. Forty-seven men and women (mean age: 32±10 years; Body Mass Index: 28.4±2.4 kg/m The total sample had an overall improvement in both BMI (-0.9±0.6) and fat mass (FM: -2.3±1.5), while lean body mass was preserved (LBM: 0.0±0.7). There were no significant differences between the two groups in variations in BC. In overweight and obese subjects undergoing a Mediterranean-type low-calorie diet, a different distribution of daily protein intake between meals and snacks does not result in significant differences in terms of FM loss and LBM maintenance. This is one of the first studies showing that nutritional dietary plans with different daily protein distribution show no particular differences in fat loss and lean mass maintenance.",

    "abstract": "Both exercise training and weight loss reduce cardiovascular risk, but the independent importance of the two strategies is unclear. We aimed to investigate independent and combined effects of exercise training and weight loss on lipoproteins and dyslipidemia in overweight sedentary men. Sixty individuals were randomized to 12 wk of endurance training (T), energy-reduced diet (D), training and energy increased diet (T-iD), or control (C). Equal energetic deficits (-600 kcal/day) were prescribed by exercise for T and caloric restriction for D. T-iD completed similar exercise but remained in energy balance due to the dietary replacement of calories expended during exercise. Total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), apolipoprotein (apo)B and A1, pre-β-HDL, and susceptibility of LDL-C to oxidation were measured. Body weight was reduced similarly between T (-5.9 ± 0.7 kg) and D (-5.2 ± 0.8 kg), whereas T-iD (-1.0 ± 0.5 kg) and C (0.1 ± 0.6 kg) remained weight stable. Plasma TC, LDL-C, and apolipoprotein B were reduced in T compared with C ( P < 0.001 for both), but this was not observed for D ( P > 0.17). Changes in TC and LDL-C were associated with changes in body weight and body fat ( P < 0.01). In T-iD, increases in HDL-C and apolipoprotein A1 were observed ( P < 0.001). In conclusion, an exercise-induced decline in body weight reduces proatherogenic apoB-containing lipoproteins, whereas exercise compensated by energy intake increases the key component of reverse cholesterol transport, i.e., apoA1-containing HDL-C. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Exercise has additive effects in lowering plasma lipoprotein particles to diet-induced weight loss in individuals with increased cardiovascular risk. In the present study, we investigated whether training per se would have beneficial cardiovascular effects. We found that 3 mo of exercise-induced weight loss reduced proatherogenic lipoproteins, whereas endurance training without weight loss improved factors involved in reverse cholesterol transport in a group of overweight sedentary men.",

Twenty-eight volunteers were randomized to a balanced deficit diet (BDD) (500 kcal/day below estimated energy needs) or an intensive, low-calorie, meal replacement diet (ILCD, 960 kcal/day). Behavioral interventions and physical activity prescriptions were similar for both groups. Primary outcomes were changes in body weight and adverse event frequency; secondary outcomes included measures of physical function and body composition. ILCD average weight change was -19.1 ± 2.2 kg or 15.9 ± 4.6% of initial body weight compared with -9.1 ± 2.7 kg or 7.2 ± 1.9% for BDD. ILCD lost more fat mass (-7.7 kg, 95% CI [-11.9 to -3.5]) but had similar loss of lean mass (-1.7 kg, 95% CI [-4.1 to 0.6]) compared with BDD. There were no significant differences in change in physical function or adverse event frequency. Compared with a traditional BDD intervention, older adults who have severe obesity treated with intensive medical weight loss had greater weight loss and decreases in fat mass without a higher frequency of adverse events. In the short term, however, this did not translate into greater improvements in physical function.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to compare body composition changes as measured by A-mode ultrasound (US) versus a criterion densitometry-based measure, air displacement plethysmography (ADP), over a 4-week weight-loss protocol in healthy, non-obese young women. Twenty healthy, young female volunteers were provided with customized dietary plans for the length of the study intended to facilitate a 500 calorie-a-day deficit. Subjects also performed 3 h a week of supervised aerobic exercise. Per cent fat mass and lean body mass were obtained via ADP and US both pre- and postintervention. Pretesting, post-testing and delta data for %fat resulted in no significant differences in mean values along with a slope of the regression line no different than one and a y-intercept no different than zero (P<0·05). Similar to %fat values, pretesting, post-testing and delta data for fat-free mass resulted in no significant differences in mean values along with a slope of the regression line no different than one and a y-intercept no different than zero (P<0·05) with the exception of the delta for slope (0·39, P = 0·04). The current findings indicate that US can provide a similar degree of accuracy for tracking group-based fat loss in women compared to ADP. Given the low-cost relative to DXA and ADP, researchers and practitioners therefore can consider US as a viable option for monitoring group-based changes in body fat over time.",

    "abstract": "The decrease in resting energy expenditure (REE) and fat oxidation with aging is associated with an increase in fat mass (FM), and both could be prevented by exercise such as resistance training. Dairy consumption has also been shown to promote FM loss in different subpopulations and to be positively associated with fat oxidation. Therefore, we sought to determine whether resistance exercise combined with dairy supplementation could have an additive impact on FM and energy metabolism, especially in individuals with a deficit in muscle mass. Twenty-six older overweight sarcopenic men (65 ± 5 years old) were recruited for the study. They participated in 4 months of resistance exercise and were randomized into three groups for postexercise shakes (control, dairy, and nondairy isocaloric and isoprotein supplement with 375 ml and ~280 calories per shake). Body composition was measured by dual X-ray absorptiometry and REE by indirect calorimetry. Fasting glucose, insulin, leptin, inflammatory profile, and blood lipid profile were also measured. Significant decreases were observed with FM only in the dairy supplement group; no changes were observed for any other variables. To conclude, FM may decrease without changes in metabolic parameters during resistance training and dairy supplementation with no caloric restriction without having any impact on metabolic properties. More studies are warranted to explain this significant decrease in FM.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this pilot study was to begin to examine the effect of dietary protein source (soy protein versus non-soy protein) during weight loss on body composition, and cardiometabolic and functional decline risk factors in older, abdominally obese adults. Two-arm, single-blind, randomized, controlled trial. Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem NC 27157, USA. 25 older (68.4±5.5 years, 88% female), abdominally obese (BMI: 35.1±4.3 kg/m2; WC: 101.4±13.1 cm) men and women were randomized to participate in the study. A 12-week weight loss intervention, with participants randomized to consume soy protein-based meal replacements (S; n=12) or non-soy protein-based meal replacements (NS; n=12), in addition to prepared meals, and all participants targeted to receive an individualized caloric deficit of 500 kcal/day. Body weight and composition (assessed via DXA and CT), conventional biomarkers of cardiometabolic risk, and physical performance measures were assessed pre- and post-intervention. Additional endpoints of feasibility (accrual, participation, retention, compliance, and safety) are reported. A total of 24 participants (87% female) completed the study (96% retention) and lost an average of 7.8±3.0 kg over the 12-week period, with no difference seen between groups (p=0.83). Although nearly all measures of global and regional body composition were significantly reduced following the 12-week intervention, differences were not observed between groups. Among cardiometabolic risk factors and physical performance measures, only diastolic blood pressure was significantly lower in the NS group compared to the S group (66.7±2.7 mmHg vs 73.5±2.7 mmHg, respectively; p=0.04). Interestingly, in groups combined, despite significant reductions in body weight and lean mass, no significant changes in 400-meter walk time (+5.3±43.4 s), short physical performance battery score (+0.1±1.0), grip strength (-0.3±3.2 kg), or relative knee extensor strength (-0.0±0.0 N/m/cm3 thigh muscle volume) were observed. Data presented here suggest that a 12-week weight loss intervention, which incorporates S and NS meal replacement products, is associated with clinically significant weight loss and improvements in several parameters of cardiometabolic risk and unchanged physical function and strength. RESULTS do not differ by protein source and suggest that soy protein is at least as good as other protein sources for weight loss during low-calorie dietary interventions in older adults.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the effects of 2 low-calorie diets but with different distributions of calories throughout the day on weight loss and other major obesity-related metabolic parameters. We randomly assigned 42 nonsmoking homemakers (age = 46.3 ± 2.3 years, body mass index [BMI] = 35.7 ± 0.8 kg/m(2), mean ± SD) in 2 groups of 21 subjects (G1 and G2). The participants underwent a 3 month individualized Mediterranean-style diet (55% carbohydrate, 30% fat, 15% protein and fiber > 30 g), calorie (600 kcal daily deficit compared to the total energy expenditure measured by a metabolic Holter). Diets consisted of the same food and complied with cardiovascular disease prevention guidelines but differed in the distribution of calories throughout the day (G1: 70% breakfast, morning snack, lunch and 30% afternoon snack and dinner; G2: 55 breakfast, morning snack, lunch and 45% afternoon snack and dinner). Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry was used for pre- and postintervention body composition assessment. Thirty-six subjects completed the study (G1 = 18, G2 = 18). Both groups had significant improvements in body composition and metabolic parameters but G1 had enhanced results for weight loss (G1: -8.2 ± 3.0 kg; G2: -6.5 ± 3.4 kg; p = 0.028), waist circumference reduction (G1: -7 ± 0.6 cm; G2: -5 ± 0.3 cm; p = 0.033), and fat mass loss (G1: -6.8 ± 2.1 kg, G2: -4.5 ± 2.9 kg, p = 0.031; mean ± SD). Improvements were detected in both groups for blood pressure and blood and lipid parameters. G1 subjects showed a greater improvement in insulin sensitivity measured by homeostasis model assessment-estimated insulin resistance (G1: -1.37 ± 0.27, G2: -0.74 ± 0.12, p = 0.017). These data suggest that a low-calorie Mediterranean diet with a higher amount of calories in the first part of the day could establish a greater reduction in fat mass and improved insulin sensitivity than a typical daily diet.",

    "title": "African American women exhibit similar adherence to intervention but lose less weight due to lower energy requirements.",
    "abstract": "African American (AA) women have been shown to lose less weight than Caucasian women in response to behavioral interventions. Our objective was to examine adherence to intervention and metabolic factors that may explain this difference. We examined longitudinal changes in body weight and energy expenditure (EE), and objective assessment of physical activity (PA) and energy intake (EI) during 6 months of a weight-loss intervention program, including prescribed calorie restriction and increased PA in 66 Caucasian and 39 AA severely obese women. Comparisons were also made in 25 Caucasian and 25 AA women matched for initial body weight. The AA women lost 3.6 kg less weight than Caucasian women. Total daily EE (TDEE) and resting metabolic rate (RMR) adjusted for fat free mass (FFM) were significantly lower in the AA women, whereas the decrease in RMR in response to weight loss was greater in Caucasian women. Adherence to the prescribed PA and change in PA in response to intervention were similar in AA and Caucasian women. Prescribed EI (1794±153 and 1806±153 kcal per day) and measured EI during intervention (2591±371 vs 2630±442 kcal per day) were nearly identical in matched AA and Caucasian women. However, the AA women lost significantly less body weight due to lower energy requirements (2924±279 vs 3116±340 kcal per day; P<0.04), resulting in a lower energy deficit (333±210 vs 485±264 kcal per day). Adherence to the behavioral intervention was similar in AA and Caucasian women. However, neglecting to account for the lower energy requirements in AA women when calculating the energy prescription resulted in a lower level of calorie restriction and, hence, less body weight loss. Therefore, to achieve similar weight loss in AA women, the prescribed caloric restriction cannot be based on weight alone, but must be lower than in Caucasians, to account for lower energy requirements.",

    "abstract": "Obesity-induced oxidative stress and inflammation are involved in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. We investigated whether diet-induced, long-term, mild weight loss improved proinflammatory cytokine levels, leukocyte count, and oxidative stress. Overweight/obese participants (25 ≤ body mass index < 34 kg/m(2), N = 122, 30-59 years) joined a 3-year-long clinical intervention involving daily 100-kcal calorie deficits. Successful weight loss was defined as a reduction in initial body weight equal to 2 kg after the clinical intervention period. Body weight in the successful mild weight loss group (SWL, n = 50) changed 5.4% (-4.16 ± 0.31 kg) compared to 0.05 ± 0.14 kg in the unsuccessful weight loss group (n = 49). After 3 years, SWL participants exhibited significantly reduced insulin, triglycerides, total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, free fatty acids, and leukocyte count (P = .030). Furthermore, in the SWL group, serum interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and urinary 8-epi-prostaglandin (PG)F2α were significantly reduced (45%, 30%, and 14%, respectively). In contrast, the unsuccessful weight loss group exhibited significant increases in percentage of body fat, waist circumference, oxidized low-density lipoprotein, and tumor necrosis factor-α, as well as a significant decrease in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. After adjusting for baseline values, the 2 groups demonstrated significantly different percentage of body fat, waist circumference, leukocyte count (P = .018), insulin, IL-6 (P = .031), IL-1β (P < .001), and tumor necrosis factor-α (P < .001), as well as urinary 8-epi-PGF2α (P = .036). A positive correlation existed between IL-1β and urinary 8-epi-PGF2α (r = 0.435, P < .001) and between changes in IL-6 and urinary 8-epi-PGF2α (r = 0.393, P < .001). Long-term mild weight loss reduces inflammatory cytokine levels, leukocyte counts, and oxidative stress and may reverse the elevated oxidative stress induced by inflammatory mediators in the overweight and obese.",

    "abstract": "Elevated ghrelin has been shown to be associated with reduced luteinizing hormone (LH) pulsatility in Rhesus monkeys, rats, men, and recently women. We previously reported that 24-h ghrelin concentrations are elevated in women following a 3-mo exercise and diet program leading to weight loss. We investigated whether the elevations in ghrelin following an ~3-mo exercise and diet program leading to weight loss are associated with a decrease in LH pulsatility. The nonexercising control group (Control, n = 5) consumed a controlled diet that matched energy needs, whereas energy intake in the exercise group (Energy Deficit, n = 16) was reduced from baseline energy requirements and supervised exercise training occurred five times per a week. Significant decreases in body weight (-3.0 ± 0.6 kg), body fat (-2.9 ± 0.4 kg) and 24-h LH pulse frequency (-0.18 ± 0.08 pulses/h), and a significant increase in 24-h mean ghrelin were observed in only the Energy Deficit group. The pre-post change in LH pulse frequency was negatively correlated with the change in mean 24-h ghrelin (R = -0.485, P = 0.030) and the change in peak ghrelin at lunch (R = -0.518, P = 0.019). Interestingly, pre-post change in night LH pulse frequency was negatively correlated with the change in mean day ghrelin (R = -0.704, P = 0.001). Elevated total ghrelin concentrations are associated with the suppression of LH pulsatility in premenopausal women and may play a role in the suppression of reproductive function following weight loss.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of a protein-rich diet in comparison with a conventional protein diet on weight loss, weight maintenance, and body composition in subjects with the metabolic syndrome. Obese subjects received instructions for an energy-restricted diet with a calorie deficit of 500 kcal/day and were randomly assigned to either high-protein (1.34 g/kg body weight) or conventional protein (0.8 g/kg body weight) diets for 12 months. Protein-enriched meal replacements were used to enrich one arm of the diet with protein throughout the study. In all, 67% of the participants completed the 1-year study. Subjects following the high-protein diet lost more body weight and more fat mass compared with those on the conventional protein diet, whereas the loss of fat-free mass was similar in both diet groups. Biochemical parameters associated with the metabolic syndrome improved in both diet groups. Improvements were modestly greater in subjects with the high-protein diet. After 12 months of treatment, 64.5% of the subjects in the high-protein diet group and 34.8% of the subjects in the conventional diet group no longer met three or more of the criteria for having the metabolic syndrome. Individuals with the metabolic syndrome achieved significant weight loss while preserving fat-free mass when treated with an energy-restricted, high-protein diet that included nutrient-dense meal replacements, as compared with the results for conventional protein intake. An intervention with a protein-enriched diet may have advantages for the management of the metabolic syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies suggest that calcium metabolism and perhaps other components of dairy products may contribute to shifting the energy balance and thus play a role in weight regulation. We compared the effects of cows' milk, calcium fortified soy milk and calcium supplement on weight and body fat reduction in premenopausal overweight and obese women. In this clinical trial, 100 healthy overweight or obese premenopausal women were randomized to one of the following dietary regimens for 8 weeks: (1) a control diet providing a 500kcal/day deficit, with 500-600mg/day dietary calcium; (2) a calcium-supplemented diet identical to the control diet with 800mg/day of calcium as calcium carbonate; (3) a milk diet providing a 500kcal/day deficit and containing three servings of low-fat milk; (4) a soy milk diet providing a 500kcal/day deficit and containing three servings of calcium fortified soy milk. At baseline and after 8 weeks, weight, waist circumference, and hip circumference were measured. Three 24-h dietary records and physical activity records were also taken. Comparing the mean differences in weight, waist circumference, body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) using repeated measure of variance analysis showed that changes in waist circumference and WHR were significant among the four groups (p=0.029 and p=0.015, respectively). After adjustment for baseline values, changes in weight and BMI were also significant (p=0.017 and p=0.019, respectively). Weight reductions in high milk, soy milk, calcium supplement and control groups were 4.43±1.93(kg), 3.46±1.28(kg), 3.89±2.40(kg) and 2.87±1.55(kg), respectively. The greatest changes were seen in the high dairy group in all variables. Increasing low fat milk consumption significantly reduces the general and central obesity beyond a low calorie diet.",

    "abstract": "Longitudinal effects of a very low-carbohydrate (VLC) and a calorie-matched high-carbohydrate (HC) weight reduction diet were compared in dietary obese Sprague-Dawley rats exhibiting impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance. Obese rats were divided into weight-matched groups: (i) VLC rats consumed an energy-restricted 5% carbohydrate, 60% fat diet for 8 weeks, (ii) HC rats consumed an isocaloric 60% carbohydrate, 15% fat diet, and (iii) HF rats consumed a high-fat diet ad libitum. HC and VLC rats showed similar reductions in body fat and hepatic lipid at the midpoint of the weight-reduction program, indicating effects due to energy deficit. At the end point, however, HC rats showed greater reductions in total and percent body fat, hepatic lipid and intramuscular lipid than did VLC rats, suggesting that diet composition induced changes in the relative efficiencies of the HC and VLC diets over time. HC rats showed marked improvement in glucose tolerance at the midpoint and end point, whereas VLC rats showed no improvement. Impaired glucose tolerance in VLC rats at the end point was due to insulin resistance and an attenuated insulin secretory response. Glucose tolerance in energy-restricted rats correlated negatively with hepatic and intramuscular lipid levels, but not visceral or total fat mass. These findings demonstrate that adaptations to diet composition eventually enabled HC rats to lose more body fat than VLC rats even though energy intakes were equal, and suggest that the elevated levels of hepatic and intramuscular lipid associated with VLC diets might predispose to insulin resistance and impaired glucose tolerance despite weight loss.",

    "abstract": "The neurohormonal control of body weight involves a complex interplay between long-term adiposity signals (e.g., leptin), and short-term satiation signals (e.g., amylin). In diet-induced obese (DIO) rodents, amylin/leptin combination treatment led to marked, synergistic, fat-specific weight loss. To evaluate the weight-lowering effect of combined amylin/leptin agonism (with pramlintide/metreleptin) in human obesity, a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, active-drug-controlled, proof-of-concept study was conducted in obese or overweight subjects (N = 177; 63% female; 39 +/- 8 years; BMI 32.0 +/- 2.1 kg/m(2); 93.3 +/- 13.2 kg; mean +/- s.d.). After a 4-week lead-in period with pramlintide (180 microg b.i.d. for 2 weeks, 360 microg b.i.d. thereafter) and diet (40% calorie deficit), subjects achieving 2-8% weight loss were randomized 1:2:2 to 20 weeks of treatment with metreleptin (5 mg b.i.d.), pramlintide (360 microg b.i.d.), or pramlintide/metreleptin (360 microg/5 mg b.i.d.). Combination treatment with pramlintide/metreleptin led to significantly greater weight loss from enrollment to week 20 (-12.7 +/- 0.9%; least squares mean +/- s.e.) than treatment with pramlintide (-8.4 +/- 0.9%; P < 0.001) or metreleptin (-8.2 +/- 1.3%; P < 0.01) alone (evaluable, N = 93). The greater reduction in body weight was significant as early as week 4, and weight loss continued throughout the study, without evidence of a plateau. The most common adverse events with pramlintide/metreleptin were injection site events and nausea, which were mostly mild to moderate and decreased over time. These results support further development of pramlintide/metreleptin as a novel, integrated neurohormonal approach to obesity pharmacotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Weight loss using low-calorie diets produces variable results, presumably due to a wide range of energy deficits and low-dietary adherence. Our objective was to quantify the relationship between dietary adherence, weight loss, and severity of caloric restriction. Participants were randomized to diet only, diet-endurance training, or diet-resistance training until body mass index (BMI) was less than 25 kg/m(2). Healthy overweight (BMI 27-30) premenopausal women (n = 141) were included in the study. An 800-kcal/d(-1) diet was provided, and the exercise groups were engaged in three sessions per week. Dietary adherence, calculated from total energy expenditure determined by doubly labeled water measurements and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry body composition changes, and degree of caloric restriction were determined. All groups had similar weight loss (approximately 12.1 +/- 2.5 kg) and length of time to reach target BMI (approximately 158 +/- 70 d). Caloric restriction averaged 59 +/- 9%, and adherence to diet was 73 +/- 34%. Adherence to diet was inversely associated to days to reach target BMI (r = -0.687; P < 0.01) and caloric restriction (r = -0.349; P < 0.01). Association between adherence to diet and percent weight lost as fat was positive for the diet-endurance training (r = 0.364; P < 0.05) but negatively correlated for the diet-only group (r = -0.387; P < 0.05). Dietary adherence is strongly associated with rates of weight loss and adversely affected by the severity of caloric restriction. Weight loss programs should consider moderate caloric restriction relative to estimates of energy requirements, rather than generic low-calorie diets.",

    "abstract": "Exercise intensity may affect the selective loss of abdominal adipose tissue. This study showed whether aerobic exercise intensity affects the loss of abdominal fat and improvement in cardiovascular disease risk factors under conditions of equal energy deficit in women with abdominal obesity. This was a randomized trial in 112 overweight and obese [body mass index (in kg/m(2)): 25-40; waist circumference >88 cm], postmenopausal women assigned to one of three 20-wk interventions of equal energy deficit: calorie restriction (CR only), CR plus moderate-intensity aerobic exercise (CR + moderate-intensity), or CR plus vigorous-intensity exercise (CR + vigorous-intensity). The diet was a controlled program of underfeeding during which meals were provided at individual calorie levels (approximately 400 kcal/d). Exercise (3 d/wk) involved treadmill walking at an intensity of 45-50% (moderate-intensity) or 70-75% (vigorous-intensity) of heart rate reserve. The primary outcome was abdominal visceral fat volume. Average weight loss for the 95 women who completed the study was 12.1 kg (+/-4.5 kg) and was not significantly different across groups. Maximal oxygen uptake ( O(2)max) increased more in the CR + vigorous-intensity group than in either of the other groups (P < 0.05). The CR-only group lost relatively more lean mass than did either exercise group (P < 0.05). All groups showed similar decreases in abdominal visceral fat (approximately 25%; P < 0.001 for all). However, changes in visceral fat were inversely related to increases in O(2)max (P < 0.01). Changes in lipids, fasting glucose or insulin, and 2-h glucose and insulin areas during the oral-glucose-tolerance test were similar across treatment groups. With a similar amount of total weight loss, lean mass is preserved, but there is not a preferential loss of abdominal fat when either moderate- or vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise is performed during caloric restriction. This trial was registered at (ClinicalTrials.gov) as: NCT00664729.",

    "abstract": "We determined the effects of acute and chronic calorie restriction with either a low-fat, high-carbohydrate (HC) diet or a low-carbohydrate (LC) diet on hepatic and skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity. Twenty-two obese subjects (body mass index, 36.5 +/- 0.8 kg/m2) were randomized to an HC (>180 g/day) or LC (<50 g/day) energy-deficit diet. A euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp, muscle biopsy specimens, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy were used to determine insulin action, cellular insulin signaling, and intrahepatic triglyceride (IHTG) content before, after 48 hours, and after approximately 11 weeks (7% weight loss) of diet therapy. At 48 hours, IHTG content decreased more in the LC than the HC diet group (29.6% +/- 4.8% vs 8.9% +/- 1.4%; P < .05) but was similar in both groups after 7% weight loss (LC diet, 38.0% +/- 4.5%; HC diet, 44.5% +/- 13.5%). Basal glucose production rate decreased more in the LC than the HC diet group at 48 hours (23.4% +/- 2.2% vs 7.2% +/- 1.4%; P < .05) and after 7% weight loss (20.0% +/- 2.4% vs 7.9% +/- 1.2%; P < .05). Insulin-mediated glucose uptake did not change at 48 hours but increased similarly in both groups after 7% weight loss (48.4% +/- 14.3%; P < .05). In both groups, insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of c-Jun-N-terminal kinase decreased by 29% +/- 13% and phosphorylation of Akt and insulin receptor substrate 1 increased by 35% +/- 9% and 36% +/- 9%, respectively, after 7% weight loss (all P < .05). Moderate calorie restriction causes temporal changes in liver and skeletal muscle metabolism; 48 hours of calorie restriction affects the liver (IHTG content, hepatic insulin sensitivity, and glucose production), whereas moderate weight loss affects muscle (insulin-mediated glucose uptake and insulin signaling).",

    "abstract": "To test the hypotheses that an egg breakfast, in contrast to a bagel breakfast matched for energy density and total energy, would enhance weight loss in overweight and obese participants while on a reduced-calorie weight loss diet. Men and women (n=152), age 25-60 years, body mass index (BMI) >or=25 and <or=50 kg m(-2). Otherwise healthy overweight or obese participants were assigned to Egg (E), Egg Diet (ED), Bagel (B) or Bagel Diet (BD) groups, based on the prescription of either an egg breakfast containing two eggs (340 kcal) or a breakfast containing bagels matched for energy density and total energy, for at least 5 days per week, respectively. The ED and BD groups were suggested a 1000 kcal energy-deficit low-fat diet, whereas the B and E groups were asked not to change their energy intake. After 8 weeks, in comparison to the BD group, the ED group showed a 61% greater reduction in BMI (-0.95+/-0.82 vs -0.59+/-0.85, P<0.05), a 65% greater weight loss (-2.63+/-2.33 vs -1.59+/-2.38 kg, P<0.05), a 34% greater reduction in waist circumference (P<0.06) and a 16% greater reduction in percent body fat (P=not significant). No significant differences between the E and B groups on the aforementioned variables were obtained. Further, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides, did not differ between the groups. The egg breakfast enhances weight loss, when combined with an energy-deficit diet, but does not induce weight loss in a free-living condition. The inclusion of eggs in a weight management program may offer a nutritious supplement to enhance weight loss.",

To determine whether fat loss induced by long-term calorie restriction (CR) or increased energy expenditure induced by exercise (EX) has different effects on CHD risk factors in nonobese subjects, we conducted a 1-yr controlled trial involving 48 nonobese subjects who were randomly assigned to one of three groups: CR, 20% CR diet (n = 18); EX, 20% increase in energy expenditure through daily exercise with no increase in energy intake (n = 18); or HL, healthy lifestyle guidelines (n = 10). Subjects were 29 women and 17 men aged 57 +/- 3 yr, with BMI 27.3 +/- 2.0 kg/m(2). Assessments included total body fat by DEXA, lipoproteins, blood pressure, HOMA-IR, C-reactive protein (CRP), and estimated 10-yr CHD risk score. Body fat decreased by 6.3 +/- 3.8 kg in CR, 5.6 +/- 4.4 kg in EX, and 0.4 +/- 1.7 kg in HL, which corresponded to reductions of 24.9, 22.3, and 1.2% of baseline body fat mass, respectively. These CR- and EX-induced energy deficits were accompanied by reductions in most of the major CHD risk factors, including plasma LDL-cholesterol, total cholesterol/HDL ratio, HOMA-IR index, and CRP concentrations that were similar in the two intervention groups. Data from the present study provide evidence that CR- and EX-induced negative energy balance result in substantial and similar improvements in the major risk factors for CHD in normal-weight and overweight middle-aged adults.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether chronic energy deficiency achieved with caloric restriction combined with exercise is associated with changes in the 24-hour profile of ghrelin in non-obese, pre-menopausal women. Twelve non-obese (BMI = 18 to 25 kg/m(2)), non-exercising women (age, 18 to 24 years) were randomly assigned to a non-exercising control group or a diet and exercise group. The 3-month diet and exercise intervention yielded a daily energy deficit of -45.7 +/- 12.4%. Serial measurements were made of body composition, energy balance, and feelings of fullness. Repeated blood sampling over 24 hours to measure ghrelin occurred before and after the study. Significant decreases in body weight, body fat, and feelings of fullness were observed in only the energy-deficit group (p < 0.05); significant changes in the following ghrelin features were found in only the deficit group (p < 0.05): elevations in baseline (+353 +/- 118 pg/mL), lunch peak (+370 +/- 102 pg/mL), dinner peak (+438 +/- 149 pg/mL), nocturnal rise (+269 +/- 77 pg/mL), and nocturnal peak (+510 +/- 143 pg/mL). In addition, we found a larger dinner decline (-197 +/- 52 pg/mL) and negative correlations between changes in the ghrelin dinner profile and changes in body weight (R = 0.784), 24-hour intake (R = 0.67), energy deficiency (R = 0.762), and feelings of fullness (R = 0.648; p < 0.05). Changes in ghrelin concentrations across the day after weight loss are closely associated with other physiological adaptations to energy deficiency, further supporting the role of ghrelin as a countermeasure to restore energy balance.",

    "abstract": "Recently, a new attention has been paid to beneficial effects of high-fat diet on the body weight reduction and metabolic profile in obese subjects. In this study we compared the effects of two hypocaloric diets with different proportion of fat on fatty acid composition (FA) in blood and adipose tissue (AT). Forty-four obese subjects were submitted to 10 weeks' low-calorie diet. Subjects were randomized into low-fat diet (LFD) (20-25% of energy content) and high-fat diet groups (HFD) (40-45%). Before and at the end of the intervention, samples of blood and subcutaneous AT were taken for the analysis of fatty acid composition. The diet-induced body weight and fat mass reduction were not different between the two diets. Plasma triacylglycerols (TAG) were reduced during HFD only. Both diets reduced proportion of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in AT and of saturated fatty acid in blood TAG, with no difference between the diets. HFD induced a higher increase of monounsaturated fatty acids in blood TAG. No other diet-induced changes were found in proportion of major classes of fatty acids. In respect to individual fatty acids, the diets induced a number of changes in AT and blood, the changes, however, not being different between the diets. Hypocaloric diets induce a number of changes in fatty acid composition in blood and adipose tissue, with little differences in respect to the proportion of fat in the diet. The results suggest the diet-induced changes in fatty acid composition are controlled by the calorie deficit of the diet and the proportion of dietary fat plays a minor role.",

Longitudinal intervention study of hypocaloric diet, diet plus low-intensity exercise, and diet plus high-intensity exercise (calorie deficit = 2800 kcal/week, 20 weeks). Forty-five obese, middle-aged women (BMI = 33.0+/-0.6 kg/m2, age = 58+/-1 years). Body composition testing and adipose tissue biopsies were conducted before and after the interventions. Subcutaneous abdominal and gluteal adipocyte size was determined. All three interventions reduced body weight, fat mass, percent fat, and waist and hip girths to a similar degree. Diet only did not change subcutaneous abdominal adipocyte size, whereas both diet plus exercise groups significantly reduced abdominal adipocyte size. Changes in abdominal adipocyte size in the diet plus exercise groups were significantly different from that of the diet group. Gluteal adipocyte size decreased similarly in all three groups. Addition of exercise training to dietary weight loss preferentially reduces subcutaneous abdominal adipocyte size in obese women.

To compare the effects of a low-carbohydrate, ketogenic diet program with those of a low-fat, low-cholesterol, reduced-calorie diet. Randomized, controlled trial. Outpatient research clinic. 120 overweight, hyperlipidemic volunteers from the community. Low-carbohydrate diet (initially, <20 g of carbohydrate daily) plus nutritional supplementation, exercise recommendation, and group meetings, or low-fat diet (<30% energy from fat, <300 mg of cholesterol daily, and deficit of 500 to 1000 kcal/d) plus exercise recommendation and group meetings. Body weight, body composition, fasting serum lipid levels, and tolerability. A greater proportion of the low-carbohydrate diet group than the low-fat diet group completed the study (76% vs. 57%; P = 0.02). At 24 weeks, weight loss was greater in the low-carbohydrate diet group than in the low-fat diet group (mean change, -12.9% vs. -6.7%; P < 0.001). Patients in both groups lost substantially more fat mass (change, -9.4 kg with the low-carbohydrate diet vs. -4.8 kg with the low-fat diet) than fat-free mass (change, -3.3 kg vs. -2.4 kg, respectively). Compared with recipients of the low-fat diet, recipients of the low-carbohydrate diet had greater decreases in serum triglyceride levels (change, -0.84 mmol/L vs. -0.31 mmol/L [-74.2 mg/dL vs. -27.9 mg/dL]; P = 0.004) and greater increases in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (0.14 mmol/L vs. -0.04 mmol/L [5.5 mg/dL vs. -1.6 mg/dL]; P < 0.001). Changes in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level did not differ statistically (0.04 mmol/L [1.6 mg/dL] with the low-carbohydrate diet and -0.19 mmol/L [-7.4 mg/dL] with the low-fat diet; P = 0.2). Minor adverse effects were more frequent in the low-carbohydrate diet group. We could not definitively distinguish effects of the low-carbohydrate diet and those of the nutritional supplements provided only to that group. In addition, participants were healthy and were followed for only 24 weeks. These factors limit the generalizability of the study results. Compared with a low-fat diet, a low-carbohydrate diet program had better participant retention and greater weight loss. During active weight loss, serum triglyceride levels decreased more and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level increased more with the low-carbohydrate diet than with the low-fat diet.",

    "abstract": "The first aim of the present study was to evaluate the changes in serum levels of cortisol, testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEA-S) and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) in response to weight loss induced by one month of treatment with a very low-calorie diet (VLCD) in twelve pairs of female obese monozygotic twins. The second aim of the study was to investigate any within-pair resemblance in serum levels of steroids and SHBG before and after a negative balance protocol, as well as the resemblance in changes in response to therapeutic weight loss. VLCD-induced weight loss of 8.7+2.9 kg was associated with significant increases in serum testosterone (p<0.05) and SHBG (p<0.001) levels, whereas no significant changes in serum levels of cortisol, DHEA and DHEA-S were observed. Significant within-pair resemblances for both pre-treatment and post-treatment concentrations were revealed for DHEA-S (pre-treatment ICC = 0.795, p < 0.01, post-treatment ICC = 0.712, p < 0.01) and for testosterone (pre-treatment ICC = 0.594, p <0.05, post-treatment ICC = 0.735, p < 0.01). The baseline within-twin-pair resemblance in serum cortisol level at 7 a.m. (ICC=0.747, p < 0.05) was lost with VLCD treatment, while its concentration at 9 p.m. developed a within-pair similarity with weight loss (ICC = 0.824, p < 0.001). Similarly, VLCD treatment led to a significant within-pair resemblance in post-treatment level of DHEA (ICC = 0.755, p < 0.01), while no within-twin-pair resemblance was shown for either pre-treatment or post-treatment SHBG levels. None of the hormones measured exhibited any within-pair resemblance in response to VLCD-induced energy deficit, except for serum cortisol levels. A significant within-twin-pair resemblance in the changes in serum cortisol levels at 7 a. m. (ICC = 0.789, F = 8.5, p < 0.001), at 1 p.m. (ICC = 0.660, F = 4.9, p <0.01) and at 9 p.m. (ICC = 0.795, F = 8.8, p <0.001) were demonstrated even after adjustment for fat mass loss. An absence of any within-pair similarity was observed in both pretreatment and post-treatment levels of SHBG, while a significant within-pair resemblance in SHBG response to VLCD treatment (ICC = 0.658, p < 0.05) was recorded. We conclude that the significant within-twin-pair resemblance demonstrated for androgens and cortisol might suggest an important role for genetic factors in the regulation of their serum levels. Our results also suggest that the mechanisms controlling baseline levels of cortisol and SHBG differ from those influencing their responses to energy deficit induced by VLCD.",

    "abstract": "To assess the genetic contribution to determinants of therapeutic weight loss in obese female identical twins. Subjects were studied for 40 days on an inpatient unit in three phases: 7 baseline days; 28 days of weight reduction by a very low calorie diet (1.6 MJ per day); and 5 days after weight reduction. Fourteen pairs of premenopausal obese female identical twins (age: 39.0+/-1.7 y; body weight (BW): 93.9+/-21.2 kg; body mass index (BMI): 34.2+/-7.8 kg/m2). : Body composition by hydrodensitometry and resting metabolic rate by indirect calorimetry were assessed before and after weight loss. : There was great variability among pairs in loss of weight (5.9-12.4 kg) and body fat (3.1-12.4 kg). By contrast, the intraclass correlation (ICC) within twin pairs was 0.85, P<0.001 for weight and 0.88, P<0.001 for body fat. A measure of metabolic efficiency, calculated as the difference between 'estimated' and 'measured' energy deficit showed high intrapair correlation (ICC=0.77; P<0.001). The high correlation in metabolic efficiency within twin pairs in response to therapeutic weight loss suggests a strong genetic contribution.",

    "title": "Gender differences in changes in subcutaneous and intra-abdominal fat during weight reduction: an ultrasound study.",
    "abstract": "In weight-reducing programs, men usually display greater improvement in metabolic risk factors than women. This gender difference may be related to enhanced weight and fat loss due to a greater energy deficit in men. To clarify the relationship between changes in metabolic profile, body fat composition, and weight loss, both sexes were studied under a regimen in which similar amounts of weight were lost. A cross-sectional study using anthropometric (body mass index and waist-to-hip ratio), impedance (bioelectrical impedance analysis) and ultrasound measurement methods (thickness of subcutaneous fat layers, intra-abdominal sagittal diameter) were conducted. The metabolic risk profile was determined by measuring lipids, lipoproteins, and blood pressure. The weight loss program lasted 15 weeks: 3 weeks under controlled conditions in the hospital and 12 weeks on an ambulatory basis. Patients were instructed to follow a mixed diet. Calorie intake was restricted to 1500 kcal/day for the men and 1200 kcal/day for the women. Thirty-two subjects with obesity (16 men and 16 women), with a mean body mass index of 35 kg/m2--matched with regard to age, height, and body weight--took part in the study. As expected, weight loss was similar for both sexes (-13.4 kg vs. -12.8 kg). Also, body fat mass changed to the same extent in absolute and relative terms. The waist-to-hip ratio was identical before and after treatment in both sexes. The men lost more visceral fat than the women. This result is based on changes in intra-abdominal diameter as well as abdominal subcutaneous fat in relation to waist circumference. Changes in abdominal diameter were paralleled by reductions in triglycerides and increases in high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol. Subcutaneous fat loss was more pronounced in women than in men. Where absolute and relative reductions in body weight and body fat are similar, men mobilize more intra-abdominal fat than women, whereas women lose more subcutaneous fat. The greater reduction in intra-abdominal fat seen in men is accompanied by a more pronounced improvement in the metabolic risk profile. Therefore, greater improvement of risk factors in men is not only related to a greater negative energy balance, as shown in most studies, but is also sex-specific.",

    "title": "Total body lipid and triglyceride response to energy deficit: relevance to body composition models.",
    "abstract": "Although the study of human body composition is advancing rapidly, confusion still prevails regarding the molecular-level lipid component. Most molecular-level body composition models are presently based on the overall hypothesis that nontriglyceride lipids constitute an insignificant proportion of total body lipid. A single lipid or \"fat\" component consisting of triglycerides is thus assumed in most molecular-level body composition models. To test this hypothesis, the present study, carried out in adult rats, was designed to examine two questions: 1) What is the proportion of total lipids as triglycerides? and 2) Is this proportion constant or does it change with negative energy balance and weight loss produced by calorie restriction and increased exercise? Results indicated that with negative energy balance and weight loss there were progressive losses of total body triglyceride and lipid. The proportion of total lipids as triglyceride was 0.83 +/- 0.08 (SD) in control animals, with reductions at 2 and 9 wk of energy restriction [0.82 +/- 0.04 (P = NS vs. control) and 0.70 +/- 0.15 (P = 0.05)] and at 9 wk for energy restriction plus exercise [0.67 +/- 0.09 (P = 0.003)]. Nontriglyceride lipids comprised 2.8% of carcass weight at baseline and decreased to 2.2% by 9 wk of energy restriction and exercise (P = NS). Substantial differences were observed between body composition ratios expressed as percentages of the lipid-free body mass (LFM) and triglyceride-free body mass (TGFM); (e.g., total body water/LFM and TGFM in controls = 72.7 +/- 0.7 and 70.4 +/- 2.2, respectively; P = 0.02). These observations strongly support the existence and importance of nontriglyceride lipids as a body composition component that responds independently from storage triglycerides, with negative energy balance produced by food restriction and exercise.",

    "abstract": "This study examined the effects of caloric restriction and weight loss on serum leptin concentrations in 49 obese women who participated in a 40-week weight loss program. During the first 12 weeks, half the subjects were provided a 1000 kcal/day low-calorie diet (LCD), compromised of portion-controlled foods, whereas the other half were prescribed a 1200 kcal/day balanced deficit diet (BDD) consisting of self-selected table foods. Thereafter, subjects in both conditions were instructed to consume approximately 1200-1800 kcal/day of self-selected foods, depending on their desired weight change. During the first 6 weeks, weight and serum leptin fell significantly more (P < 0.05) in women in the LCD condition than in the BDD condition. In the former group, the 55% reduction in baseline leptin was 10 times greater than the relative reduction in body weight. Stepwise multiple regression analysis revealed that degree of caloric restriction, but not weight loss, contribution significantly to the variance in the change in leptin at week 6. By contrast, long-term changes in leptin, when subjects had increased their calorie intake, were more strongly related to changes in weight and fat. At week 40, for example, weight loss account for 47% of the variance in the change in leptin. Serum leptin and body fat remained highly correlated after weight loss (r = 0.79, P < 0.001), as before (r = 0.66, P < 0.001). After treatment, however, we observed a greater-than-expected reduction in serum leptin concentrations, as expressed per kilogram of body fat. The significance of this finding remains to be determined.",

    "abstract": "This study was designed: 1) to evaluate the effect of weight loss on body fat distribution, 2) to determine whether indices of body fat distribution can be considered as a prognostic indicator for the ability to lose weight and 3) to evaluate whether a change of body fat distribution is associated with changes in plasma glucose, lipids and lipoproteins in both sexes in order to evaluate a gender difference. 63 obese subjects (41 women and 22 men) were treated on an outpatient basis with an energy-reduced, protein-enriched low calorie diet (3150-4200 kJ/day) for a 6-month period. They were divided in different groups according to gender and body fat distribution using the waist-to-hip circumference ratio. Body fat topography can be altered by dieting, but not by more than it increases when a person gains weight. Body fat distribution seems to be a significant prognostic indicator for the ability to lose weight in women but not in men. Although body weight and the waist-to-hip circumference decreased significantly, no relationships were found between percent decrease in these parameters and percent changes in plasma glucose, lipids and lipoproteins. We conclude that an important caloric deficit may lead to a series of metabolic improvements but that gender and the type of fat distribution are important confounding factors in the prediction of metabolic success.",

Patients were randomly assigned to a very-low-calorie diet (VLCD, 500 kcal/d) or a balanced-deficit diet (BDD, 1200 kcal/d). After 8 wk of supplemented fasting, REE of the VLCD patients decreased by 17% whereas that of the BDD patients was virtually unchanged. REE of the VLCD patients increased during 12 subsequent weeks of realimentation such that differences in REE between the two groups were not statistically significant at week 24 (VLCD = -11%, BDD = -2%). Reductions in weight and fat-free mass (FFM) were 12.1% and 3.6% for the VLCD patients and 10.6% and 4.1% for the BDD patients, respectively. There were no significant differences between the groups in pre- to posttreatment changes in REE normalized to FFM. Results suggest that REE recovers partially after consumption of a VLCD. They also provide evidence of a possible metabolic advantage of weight loss by a more moderate restriction.",

Loss of weight but not of adipose tissue was significantly greater on the 330-kcal/d diet. It is likely that dehydration rather than protein catabolism was responsible for additional loss of fat-free mass in the 330-kcal/d group because the nitrogen deficit was not excessive. The thermic response to food was blunted only in the 330-kcal/d group whereas resting oxygen uptake decreased by equal amounts in both groups. There was a decrease in 24-h urinary noradrenaline in the 330-kcal/d group but plasma fT4 was sustained when compared with the 780-kcal/d group; fT3 decreased significantly more quickly in the 330-kcal/d group.

    "abstract": "Obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are metabolic diseases with increasing prevalence worldwide. Obesity often leads to T2D. Insulin resistance and impaired β cell function contribute to the onset of hyperglycemia. Previously, we reported that ablation of Gc, encoding a secreted protein with a primary role in vitamin D transport, improved pancreatic β cell function in models of diet-induced insulin resistance. Here, we show that Gc ablation had systemic insulin-sensitizing effects to prevent weight gain, hyperglycemia, and glucose intolerance; lower nonesterified fatty acids and triglycerides; and augment glucose uptake in skeletal muscle and adipose in male mice fed a high-fat diet. Interestingly, weight loss in Gc-ablated mice resulted from selective fat mass loss with preserved lean mass. Moreover, acute Gc inhibition prevented glucose intolerance caused by high-fat feeding. The data suggest that Gc inhibition can increase insulin production in β cells and insulin action in peripheral tissues, while reducing fat mass.",

    "abstract": "Despite the beneficial impact of bariatric surgery on obesity and metabolic disease, continued post-surgical obesity and weight recurrence are common, but may be impacted by diet. While guidelines recommend a post-operative high-protein diet to preserve lean mass, emerging evidence suggests that humans and mice are metabolically healthier on low-protein diets. Here, we assess the effect of varying dietary protein on post-surgical metabolism in a mouse model of sleeve gastrectomy. We find that a low-protein diet optimally drives post-surgical weight loss, boosts energy expenditure, and improves blood glucose regulation, likely, in part, due to the induction of FGF21. Through multi-omics, we identified clusters of differentially expressed genes and metabolites that correlate with these phenotypes and find that diet heavily influences the liver's molecular response to sleeve gastrectomy. These results suggest that current post-surgical high-protein diets may limit the short- and long-term benefits of surgery and warrant human clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "Carbohydrate-restricted diets (CRDs) are widely promoted for improving cardiovascular and body composition outcomes, yet evidence remains mixed across dietary patterns, populations, and study designs. This meta-analysis evaluated the effects of CRDs on cardiovascular and anthropometric outcomes and examined whether these effects varied by diet type, macronutrient replacement, participant characteristics, and study features. Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 2020 guidelines, 174 randomized trials (n = 11,481) from 27 countries were included. Eligible studies compared CRDs (≤45% of energy from carbohydrates) to higher-carbohydrate diets in adults and reported cardiovascular or anthropometric outcomes. Random-effects models estimated standardized mean differences (SMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Subgroup analyses explored differences by CRD type (ketogenic, low-carb, and moderate-carb), replacement macronutrient (fat, protein, or combination), sex, weight status, diabetes status, intervention delivery, caloric intakes, and study design. Metaregressions assessed the effects of intervention duration. CRDs significantly reduced triglycerides [SMD: -15.11 mg/dL; 95% CI: -18.76, -11.46], systolic (SMD: -2.05 mmHg; 95% CI: -3.13, -0.96) and diastolic blood pressure (SMD: -1.26 mmHg; 95% CI: -1.94, -0.57), various lipid profile ratios, and inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, tumor necrosis factor-alpha), whereas increasing high-density lipoprotein (SMD: 2.92 mg/dL, 95% CI: 2.10, 3.74). Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and total cholesterol increased modestly (SMD: 4.81, 95% CI: 2.58, 7.05; and SMD: 4.32 mg/dL, 95% CI: 1.66, 6.97, respectively). All measured body composition markers showed significant reductions. Moderate-carbohydrate diets offered balanced benefits, whereas ketogenic diets produced greater weight loss but greater increases in LDL and total cholesterol. Combined fat and protein replacements yielded the most comprehensive improvements. Benefits were most pronounced in females and individuals with overweight or obesity. Longer interventions amplified effects on lipid ratios and inflammatory markers. CRDs improved cardiovascular health and body composition, especially in diets with combined macronutrient replacement. Potential adverse effects, including LDL elevation and lean mass loss, warrant clinical monitoring. for body composition, PROSPERO: CRD420251043066 (https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/view/CRD420251043066); for cardiovascular health: CRD420251011748 (https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/view/CRD420251011748).",

    "abstract": "Although indicated as adjunctive therapy for seizure disorders, ketogenic diets (KDs) have gained popularity for weight loss and mitigating the metabolic risks associated with severe obesity. However, efficacy, durability, and long-term consequences are incompletely understood. In preclinical models, most studies have included only male mice, precluding an understanding of sex-specific responses to KD. In this study, we investigated sex differences in response to a high-fat, low carbohydrate, low-protein KD using male and female C57BL/6J mice. Despite equivalent circulating levels of β-hydroxybutyrate, male mice exhibited weight loss characterized by loss of fat mass and lean mass in concert with increased energy expenditure. In contrast, female mice exhibited increased fat mass and body weight on the KD. Male mice manifested increased insulin sensitivity, without reducing glucose excursions during glucose tolerance testing, in concert with decreased glucose-stimulated insulin release. In contrast, females developed glucose intolerance and insulin resistance relative to control females. Following oophorectomy, female mice lost weight on KD but remained glucose intolerant. Orchidectomy in male mice reversed weight loss in KD males. Circulating fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) concentrations were increased in males but not females on KD and correlated with increased FGF21 expression in brown adipose tissue. These findings demonstrate that the metabolic effects of KD are sex-specific and suggest that gonadal hormones modulate the adaptive response to ketogenic diets via FGF21 signaling.",

    "abstract": "To examine the association between dietary macronutrient composition and 12-month weight loss maintenance (WLM) in adults who achieved initial weight loss (≥ 5%). This prospective cohort analysis used 12-month follow-up data from the Navigating to a Healthy Weight trial. Macronutrient composition (%) was assessed using a 4-day, 24-h dietary recall. Food sources were categorized as discretionary foods, lean meat, vegetables, fruit, grains, and dairy. Primary outcomes included 12-month changes in body weight, fat mass index (FMI), waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), and hip-to-height ratio (HHtR). A nutritional geometry approach was used to examine individual and interactive associations of macronutrient intake, visualizing as response surfaces. Among 1518 participants (69.8% women; mean age 45 ± 12 years), mean macronutrient composition was 20.6% protein, 33.8% fat, and 43.1% carbohydrate. Protein energy percentage was inversely associated with energy intake (β: -0.33; 95% CI: -0.39, -0.27). Response surfaces revealed that lower proportional energy from protein, diluted by high fat and/or carbohydrate, was associated with higher total energy intake and greater 12-month increases in body weight, WHtR, and HHtR, but not FMI. Consumption of discretionary food, not other food sources, increased energy intake by reducing proportional energy from protein. Maintaining dietary proportional energy from protein, particularly by limiting discretionary food consumption, was associated with reduced energy intake and improved WLM.",

    "title": "Discovery of pan-EphB tyrosine kinase inhibitor for metabolic syndrome sparing EphB3 signaling in mice.",
    "abstract": "The global prevalence of metabolic syndrome had created one of the most pressing public health dilemmas and significant financial burden to the healthcare system. Despite the surge of glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists, recent studies showed that 40 % of body weight loss is due to lean mass loss, raising the concern about induction of musculoskeletal arthritis. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop novel therapeutic strategies to tackle the progression of metabolic disorders with minimal adverse effects. EphB singaling had been validated in the progression of metabolic syndrome. We leveraged the resolved X-ray crystal structure of the hEphB1 kinase domain to introduce thienopyridine-based analogs (termed STA analogs) that showed potential pan-inhibitory profiles for EphB1, EphB2, and EphB4 with no inhibition for EphB3 tyrosine kinase singaling pathways. STA-013 inhibited EphB1, EphB2, and EphB4 tyrosine kinases selectively, as validated by a premier kinase profiling assay against 140 protein kinases, with no inhibitory profile against EphB3 tyrosine kinase. Systemic injections of STA-013 resulted in weight loss with significant reduction of fat mass and perseverance of lean mass. This was associated with significant improvement in glucose homeostasis, mitigation of insulin resistance, and inhibition of fatty liver in high-fat diet-induced obese mice. This was allied with modulation of respiratory exchange rates during the dark cycle, with no change in food intake. Additionally, STA-013 administration resulted in inhibiting the EphB phosphorylated signal, coupled with increased p-AKT/AKT signaling, to suggest insulin signaling activation. STA-013 showed an elevated signal for InsR-β, which reversed the effect of insulin on InsR degradation, allowing for the restoration of glucose homeostasis and mitigating insulin resistance.",

    "abstract": "Cancer cachexia is a multifactorial syndrome characterized by involuntary weight loss, muscle mass reduction, and systemic inflammatory response, negatively impacting the quality of life and survival of cancer patients. In gastrointestinal tumors, cachexia prevalence can reach up to 80%, presenting a complex clinical challenge. This review aims to explore the efficacy of a multimodal approach integrating nutritional support and physical activity in cancer cachexia management. Targeted dietary strategies, such as a high-protein diet enriched with omega-3 and branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), have proven effective in counteracting muscle loss and modulating inflammatory metabolism. Physical activity, particularly resistance training, contributes to preserving lean mass and improving physical function. However, current data suggest that no single strategy is sufficient to reverse cachexia, necessitating combined treatment with supportive pharmacological therapies, including progestogens, muscle metabolism modulators, and cytokine antagonists. Despite the evidence supporting these interventions, significant gaps remain, highlighting the need for randomized clinical trials to define the optimal therapeutic protocol for gastrointestinal cancer patients with cachexia.",

    "abstract": "This narrative review aimed to provide an overview of the current evidence on the impact of various nutritional strategies on body composition in people living with obesity (PLwO), with particular attention to fat mass (FM), fat-free mass (FFM), and fat distribution. Obesity is increasingly linked to cardiometabolic complications, yet common diagnostic metrics such as body mass index (BMI) do not capture changes in FM or FFM. Recent studies highlight the variable effects of different dietary interventions on body compartments. High-protein and ketogenic diets are associated with greater preservation of FFM and reductions in visceral adipose tissue (VAT), while the Mediterranean diet shows promise for long-term adherence and improvements in metabolic health. Intermittent fasting and time-restricted eating demonstrate efficacy in FM reduction but present mixed results regarding FFM retention and sustainability. Dietary strategies exert diverse effects on body composition in PLwO, underscoring the importance of tailoring interventions to individual metabolic profiles and health goals. Personalized nutrition approaches that prioritize the preservation of lean mass and reduction of VAT, along with sustainable adherence, are critical for optimizing obesity management beyond weight loss alone.",

    "abstract": "Glucagon-like peptide- 1 receptor agonists (GLP- 1 RA) are a rapidly expanding class of medications used to treat many chronic diseases. This review explores factors that may contribute to accelerated muscle loss among higher-risk patient populations and describes tailored interventions to reduce the risk of accelerated sarcopenia and frailty. While GLP- 1 RA can result in total weight loss upwards of 25%, recent studies show that they can also lead to significant loss of lean body mass, reaching as high as 15-40% of total weight lost. This rapid and significant decline in muscle mass while taking GLP- 1 RA places certain patient populations already predisposed to sarcopenia at higher risk for muscle loss and adverse events. Currently, there is insufficient evidence delving into the impact of GLP- 1 RA on body composition among older adults, patients with chronic kidney disease, liver disease, and inflammatory bowel disease. However, research suggests that a high protein diet and resistance training may help prevent loss of muscle mass during GLP- 1 RA usage. A targeted and individualized nutrition and physical activity regimen should be instituted for each patient with a focus on optimizing protein intake and performing frequent resistance training in order to minimize loss of muscle mass while promoting the loss of fat mass. Future research should evaluate the impact of GLP- 1 RA on sarcopenia in high-risk patient populations.",

High protein diets have been shown to produce greater fat loss and retention of lean mass during periods of energy restriction (ER) in sedentary individuals with obesity, but less is known about the effects of high protein diets in trained individuals during ER. Although current recommendations for protein intake in active individuals are 1.2-1.7 g/kg, it is unclear whether higher intakes are necessary to maximize FFM retention and maximize physical performance in athletes undergoing periods of ER. Determine whether high protein intakes could maximize FFM retention and physical performance in trained individuals after a period of ER. Twenty-one college aged athletes underwent a 6-week 25% ER + 3-day full body resistance training. Participants were randomly assigned to a low (~1.2 g/kg), moderate (~1.6 g/kg) or high (~2.2 g/kg) protein intake. Baseline and post-intervention outcomes: Dual X-ray absorptiometry, isotopic water dilution, indirect calorimetry, dietary records and strength based physical testing. Significant reductions in body mass (p = 0.047) and fat mass (p = 0.04) with simultaneous increases in FFM (p = 0.037) were noted for all groups, with no protein intake effect. Significant increases in physical performance outcomes (5RM strength) were noted for most measures (p < 0.05). Current protein intake recommendations of 1.2-1.7 g/kg appear sufficient for most athletes even during periods of ER to maintain FFM and physical performance.",

    "abstract": "Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists and dual agonists have changed the treatment landscape of obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D), but significant limitations have emerged due to their gastrointestinal side effects, loss of lean mass, and necessity for ongoing subcutaneous injections. Our objective was, therefore, to test a novel small molecule as a different and potentially better tolerated oral medications to improve obesity-associated impairment in glucose homeostasis. High-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice or severely obese, leptin-deficient ob/ob mice were randomly assigned to serve as controls or receive oral TIX100, a novel thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) inhibitor just approved by the FDA as an investigational new drug for type 1 diabetes (T1D). The TIX100 effects on glucose intolerance and weight control were then assessed. TIX100 protected against HFD-induced glucose intolerance, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperglucagonemia. TIX100 also reduced diet-induced adiposity resulting in 15% lower weight in treated mice as compared with controls on HFD (p <0.05), while preserving lean mass. Even though the TIX100 weight effects were lost in ob/ob mice, TIX100 improved glucose control leading to a dramatic 2.3% reduction in HbA1C (p <0.05), independent of any weight loss. This is consistent with the beneficial effects of TIX100 in non-obese diabetes models and its protection against elevated TXNIP and islet cell stress common to all diabetes types. Thus, TIX100 may provide a novel, oral therapy for T2D that targets underlying disease pathology including islet cell dysfunction and hyperglucagonemia and promotes metabolic health and weight control without aggressive weight loss.",

    "abstract": "Childhood obesity increases the risk of developing metabolic diseases in adulthood, since environmental stimuli during critical windows of development can impact on adult metabolic health. Studies demonstrating the effect of prepubertal diet on adult metabolic disease risk are still limited. We hypothesized that a prepubertal control diet (CD) protects the adult metabolic phenotype from diet-induced obesity (DIO), while a high-fat diet (HFD) would predispose to adult metabolic alterations. Sprague-Dawley male rats were fed either a CD or a HFD during the prepubertal period (day 30-40 of age) and subsequently a chronic HFD or CD, respectively, until adulthood (day 220 of age). As controls, rats aged 30 days were exclusively fed a CD or a HFD until adulthood. Body weight and composition, metabolic rate, biochemical and hormonal plasma measurements, hepatic gene expression and methylation and hydroxymethylation levels were analyzed at ages 30, 40 and 220 days. The prepubertal CD prevented fat mass accumulation, lean mass loss and metabolic inflexibility, showed lower insulin, leptin and cholesterol concentrations in adulthood despite the chronic HFD. Notably, the prepubertal CD led to higher hepatic Lxrα expression, lower hepatic global DNA methylation and higher hydroxymethylation in adulthood despite a chronic HFD. Conversely, a prepubertal HFD decreased adult metabolic flexibility, increased serum cholesterol, and decreased Lxrα expression and global DNA hydroxymethylation, while also increasing DNA methylation levels despite a chronic CD. In summary, a prepubertal CD protected the adult metabolic phenotype from high cholesterol concentrations associated with increased hepatic Lxrα expression and lower hepatic global DNA methylation in adulthood, despite exposure to a chronic HFD. Conversely, a prepubertal HFD altered the adult metabolic phenotype.",

    "abstract": "Omega-3 (ω-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids in fish oil have been shown to prevent diet-induced obesity in lean mice and to promote heat production in adipose tissue. However, the effects of fish oil on obese animals remain unclear. This study investigated the effects of fish oil in obese mice. C57BL/6J mice were fed a lard-based high-fat diet (LD) for 8 weeks and then assigned to either a fish oil-based high-fat diet (FOD) or continued the LD for additional 8 weeks. A control group was fed a standard diet for 16 weeks. Mice fed the FOD showed weight loss, reduced adipose tissue mass, and lower plasma insulin and leptin levels compared to those fed the LD. Rectal temperatures were higher in the FOD and LD groups compared to the control group. Energy intake was lower in the FOD group than the LD group but similar to the control group. The FOD and LD groups exhibited increased expression of heat-producing genes such as ",

    "abstract": "Nutrition support is an essential aspect of treatment after bariatric surgery (BS). A high-protein diet with an intake of up to 1.5 g/kg of ideal body weight (IBW) per day is recommended to minimize loss of lean body mass after BS. However, protein intake recommendations may need to be adjusted for patients with compromised renal function, necessitating an individualized approach tailored to each patient's clinical status. This case report aimed to demonstrate nutritional evaluation, education, and counseling for a male patient with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who underwent BS one year after surgery. Following BS, the patient adhered to the standard Seoul National University Hospital BS diet protocol. Considering his postoperative renal function, protein requirement was set at 1.0 g/kg of IBW. A total of 10 individualized nutritional counseling sessions were conducted according to renal function and complications. One year after BS, he successfully lost weight with % excess weight loss of 93%, maintained CKD stage 3, reduced prescription of oral hypoglycemic agent, improved glycated hemoglobin levels, and improved eating habits significantly. Thus, individualized nutrition intervention is important for supporting patients with CKD to reach their goal weight after BS, improve nutritional status, and prevent post-operative complications.",

    "abstract": "Retinoic acid (RA) participates in weight regulation and energy metabolism. Mice lacking ALDH1A1, one of the major enzymes responsible for RA biosynthesis, are resistant to diet-induced obesity. Previously, we identified FSI-TN42 (N42) as an ALDH1A1-specific inhibitor and reported its pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well as its efficacy in weight suppression. In the first study, C57BL/6 J male mice were fed a high fat diet for 8 weeks to induce obesity. Mice were then divided into three groups and fed (1) moderate fat diet (MFD), (2) MFD + WIN 18,446 (1 g/kg diet), or (3) MFD + N42 (1 g/kg diet) for 8 weeks. A control group of mice were fed a low-fat diet for the entire period. Mice were weighed weekly and fasting glucose was determined every 4 weeks. Tissues were examined for potential toxicity using histopathology and complete blood counts. In the second study, we examined influences of N42 on energy balance and/or appetite by determining food intake, activity and energy expenditure in mice with obesity treated with MFD or MFD + N42. Lastly, we tested fertility with a mating study. N42 significantly accelerated weight loss compared to MFD alone in mice with obesity by reducing fat mass without decreasing lean mass. N42 did not alter food intake or activity levels. While mice treated with N42 lost significantly more weight, they maintained a similar level of energy expenditure compared to mice fed MFD only. Mice fed N42 preferentially used fat postprandially, especially under thermoneutral or mild cold challenge. N42 did not affect male fertility. N42 promotes weight loss when used with MFD in mice with diet-induced obesity without causing significant organ toxicity or male infertility. Future studies will determine if N42 can be used to promote further weight loss if combined with current weight loss drugs.",

    "abstract": "Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) is a bone-secreted protein widely recognized as a critical regulator of skeletal and mineral metabolism. However, little is known about the nonskeletal production of FGF23 and its role in tissues other than bone. Growing evidence indicates that circulating FGF23 levels rise with a high-fat diet (HFD) and they are positively correlated with body mass index (BMI) in humans. In the present study, we show for the first time that increased circulating FGF23 levels in obese humans correlate with increased expression of adipose Fgf23 and both positively correlate with BMI. To understand the role of adipose-derived Fgf23, we generated adipocyte-specific Fgf23 knockout mice (AdipoqFgf23Δfl/Δfl) using the adiponectin-Cre driver, which targets mature white, beige, and brown adipocytes. Our data show that targeted ablation of Fgf23 in adipocytes prevents HFD-fed female mice from gaining body weight and fat mass while preserving lean mass but has no effect on male mice, indicating the presence of sexual dimorphism. These effects are observed in the absence of changes in food and energy intake. Adipose Fgf23 inactivation also prevents dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, and hepatic steatosis in female mice. Moreover, these changes are associated with decreased respiratory exchange ratio and increased brown fat Ucp1 expression in knockout mice compared to HFD-fed control mice (Fgf23fl/fl). In conclusion, this is the first study highlighting that targeted inactivation of Fgf23 is a promising therapeutic strategy for weight loss and lean mass preservation in humans.",

    "abstract": "Understanding why subjects with overweight and with obesity vary in their response to dietary interventions is of major interest for developing personalized strategies for body mass regulation. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between changes in the urine metabolome and body mass during a breakfast meal intervention. Furthermore, we aimed to elucidate if the baseline urine metabolome could predict the response to the two types of breakfast meals (high versus low protein) during the intervention. A total of 75 young, women with overweight were randomly allocated to one of two intervention groups: (1) High-protein (HP) or (2) low-protein (LP) breakfast as part of their habitual diet during a 12-week intervention. Beside the breakfast meal, participants were instructed to eat their habitual diet and maintain their habitual physical activity level. Nuclear magnetic resonance-based metabolomics was conducted on urine samples collected at baseline (wk 0), mid-intervention (wk 6), and at endpoint (wk 12). At baseline and endpoint, body mass was measured and DXA was used to measure lean body mass and fat mass. The baseline urine metabolite profile showed a slightly higher correlation (R2 = 0.56) to body mass in comparison with lean body mass (R2 = 0.51) and fat mass (R2 = 0.53). Baseline 24-h urinary excretion of trigonelline (p = 0.04), N, N-dimethylglycine (p = 0.02), and trimethylamine (p = 0.03) were significantly higher in individuals who responded with a reduction in body mass to the HP breakfast. Differences in the urine metabolome were seen for women that obtained a body weight loss in the response to the HP breakfast intervention and women who did not obtain a body weight loss, indicating that the urine metabolome contains information about the metabolic phenotype that influences the responsiveness to dietary interventions.",

    "abstract": "Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a highly prevalent, complex, heterogeneous, polygenic endocrine disorder characterized by metabolic and reproductive dysfunction that affects 8-13% of women of reproductive age worldwide. The pathogenesis of PCOS has not been fully clarified and includes genetics, obesity, and insulin resistance (IR). Oxidative stress (OS) of PCOS is independent of obesity. It can induce IR through post-insulin receptor defects, impair glucose uptake in muscle and adipose tissue, and exacerbate IR by reducing insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells. To investigate the effects of Calorie Restricted Diet (CRD), High Protein Diet (HPD), and High Protein and High Dietary Fiber Diet (HPD+HDF) on body composition, insulin resistance, and oxidative stress in overweight/obese PCOS patients. A total of 90 overweight/obese patients with PCOS were selected to receive an 8- week medical nutrition weight loss intervention at our First Hospital of Peking University, and we randomly divided them into the CRD group (group A), the HPD group (group B), and the HPD+HDF group (group C), with 30 patients in each group. We measured their body composition, HOMA-IR index, and oxidative stress indicators. The t-test, Mann-Whitney U test, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and Kruskal-Wallis H test were used to compare the efficacy of the three methods. After eight weeks, the body weights of the three groups decreased by 6.32%, 5.70% and 7.24%, respectively, and the Visceral Fat Area (VFA) values decreased by 6.8 cm All three diets were effective in reducing the body weight of overweight/obese patients with PCOS by more than 5% within 8 weeks and could improve both insulin resistance and oxidative stress damage. Compared with CRD, HPD and HPD+HDF diets could better retain lean body mass and significantly improve oxidative stress damage.",

    "abstract": "Considering the high prevalence of obesity and related metabolic impairments in the population, the unique role nutrition has in weight loss, reversing metabolic disorders, and maintaining health cannot be overstated. Normal weight and well-being are compatible with varying dietary patterns, but for the last half century there has been a strong emphasis on low-fat, low-saturated fat, high-carbohydrate based approaches. Whereas low-fat dietary patterns can be effective for a subset of individuals, we now have a population where the vast majority of adults have excess adiposity and some degree of metabolic impairment. We are also entering a new era with greater access to bariatric surgery and approval of anti-obesity medications (glucagon-like peptide-1 analogues) that produce substantial weight loss for many people, but there are concerns about disproportionate loss of lean mass and nutritional deficiencies. No matter the approach used to achieve major weight loss, careful attention to nutritional considerations is necessary. Here, we examine the recent findings regarding the importance of adequate protein to maintain lean mass, the rationale and evidence supporting low-carbohydrate and ketogenic dietary patterns, and the potential benefits of including exercise training in the context of major weight loss. While losing and sustaining weight loss has proven challenging, we are optimistic that application of emerging nutrition science, particularly personalized well-formulated low-carbohydrate dietary patterns that contain adequate protein (1.2 to 2.0 g per kilogram reference weight) and achieve the beneficial metabolic state of euketonemia (circulating ketones 0.5 to 5 mM), is a promising path for many individuals with excess adiposity.",

    "abstract": "Chronic low-grade inflammatory profile (CLIP) is one of the pathways involved in type 2 diabetes (T2D). Currently, there is limited evidence for ameliorating effects of combined lifestyle interventions on CLIP in type 2 diabetes. We investigated whether a 13-week combined lifestyle intervention, using hypocaloric diet and resistance exercise plus high-intensity interval training with or without consumption of a protein drink, affected CLIP in older adults with T2D. In this post-hoc analysis of the PROBE study 114 adults (≥55 years) with obesity and type 2 (pre-)diabetes had measurements of C-reactive protein (CRP), pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-6, tumor-necrosis-factor (TNF)-α, and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10, IL-1 receptor antagonist (RA), and soluble tumor-necrosis-factor receptor (sTNFR)1, adipokines leptin and adiponectin, and glycation biomarkers carboxymethyl-lysine (CML) and soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products (sRAGE) from fasting blood samples. A linear mixed model was used to evaluate change in inflammatory biomarkers after lifestyle intervention and effect of the protein drink. Linear regression analysis was performed with parameters of body composition (by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) and parameters of insulin resistance (by oral glucose tolerance test). There were no significant differences in CLIP responses between the protein and the control groups. For all participants combined, IL-1RA, leptin and adiponectin decreased after 13 weeks (p = 0.002, p < 0.001 and p < 0.001), while ratios TNF-α/IL-10 and TNF-α/IL-1RA increased (p = 0.003 and p = 0.035). CRP increased by 12 % in participants with low to average CLIP (pre 1.91 ± 0.39 mg/L, post 2.13 ± 1.16 mg/L, p = 0.006) and decreased by 36 % in those with high CLIP (pre 5.14 mg/L ± 1.20, post 3.30 ± 2.29 mg/L, p < 0.001). Change in leptin and IL-1RA was positively associated with change in fat mass (β = 0.133, p < 0.001; β = 0.017, p < 0.001) and insulin resistance (β = 0.095, p = 0.024; β = 0.020, p = 0.001). Change in lean mass was not associated with any of the biomarkers. 13 weeks of combined lifestyle intervention, either with or without protein drink, reduced circulating adipokines and anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-1RA, and increased inflammatory ratios TNF-α/IL-10 and TNF-α/IL-1RA in older adults with obesity and T2D. Effect on CLIP was inversely related to baseline inflammatory status.",

    "title": "Liraglutide improved the reproductive function of obese mice by upregulating the testicular AC3/cAMP/PKA pathway.",
    "abstract": "The incidence of male reproductive dysfunction is increasing annually, and many studies have shown that obesity can cause severe harm to male reproductive function. The mechanism of male reproductive dysfunction caused by obesity is unclear, and there is no ideal treatment. Identification of effective therapeutic drugs and elucidation of the molecular mechanism involved in male reproductive health are meaningful. In this study, we investigated the effects of the GLP-1 receptor agonist liraglutide on sex hormones, semen quality, and testicular AC3/cAMP/PKA levels in high-fat-diet-induced obese mice. Obese mice and their lean littermates were treated with liraglutide or saline for 12 weeks. Body weight was measured weekly. Fasting blood glucose (FBG) was measured using a blood glucose test strip. The serum levels of insulin (INS), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), testosterone (T), free testosterone (F-TESTO), estradiol (E2), and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) were detected using ELISA. The sperm morphology and sperm count were observed after Pap staining. The mRNA and protein expression levels of testicular GLP-1R and AC3 were measured by RT-qPCR and Western blot, respectively. Testicular cAMP levels and PKA activity were detected using ELISA. Liraglutide treatment can decrease body weight, FBG, INS, HOMA-IR, E2 and SHBG levels; increase LH, FSH, T, and F-TESTO levels; increase sperm count; decrease the sperm abnormality rate; and increase GLP-1R and AC3 expression levels and cAMP levels and PKA activity in testicular tissue. Liraglutide can improve the sex hormone levels and semen quality of obese male mice. In addition to its weight loss effect, liraglutide can improve the reproductive function of obese male mice, which may also be related to the upregulation of AC3/cAMP/PKA pathway in the testis. This work lays the groundwork for future clinical studies.",

    "abstract": "Malnutrition and metabolic alterations of cancer cachexia are often associated with negative weight loss and muscle mass wasting. In this sense, protein supplementation can be a strategy to help counteract the loss and/or maintenance of mass in these patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of leucine supplementation on body composition in outpatients with gastrointestinal tract cancer. It was a randomized, blinded, controlled, parallel trial, performed in male patients with a cancer diagnosis of the gastrointestinal tract and appendix organs undergoing chemotherapy. All the patients were allocated to one of the protocol groups: L-leucine supplement or the control group, during 8 weeks of intervention. We evaluated the body composition through bioelectrical impedance analysis, the cancer cachexia classification, and the diet intake before and after the intervention protocol. The intention-to-treat approach was performed to predict the missing values for all patients who provide any observation data. The patients were an average age of 65.11 ± 7.50 years old. In the body composition analysis with patients who finished all the supplementation, we observed a significant gain in body weight (61.79.9 ± 9.02 versus 64.06 ± 9.45,  A balanced diet enriched with free-Leucine supplementation was able to promotes gains in body weight and lean mass in older men diagnosticated with gastrointestinal and appendix organs of digestion cancer after 8 weeks. However, the fact that most men are non-cachectic or pre-cachectic is not clear if the increase in muscle mass was due to a high intake of leucine, since no difference between groups was detected. Moreover, we know that benefits on body composition are due to adequate calorie and macronutrients consumption and that balanced feeding according to nutrition Guidelines seems crucial and must be advised during the oncological treatment.",

    "title": "Diet-induced obesity does not exacerbate cachexia in male mice bearing Lewis-lung carcinoma tumors.",
    "abstract": "Cachexia is a muscle-wasting syndrome commonly observed in patients with cancer, which can significantly worsen clinical outcomes. Because of a global rise in obesity, the coexistence of cachexia in obese individuals poses unique challenges, with the impact of excessive adiposity on cachexia severity and underlying pathophysiology not well defined. Understanding the interplay between cachexia and obesity is crucial for improving diagnosis and treatment strategies for these patients; therefore, the present study examined differences in cachexia between lean and obese mice bearing Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) tumors. Nine-week-old, male C57Bl6J mice were placed on either a chow or a high-fat diet (HFD) for 9 wk. After the diet intervention, mice were inoculated with LLC or vehicle. Markers of cachexia, such as body and muscle loss, were noted in both chow and HFD groups with tumors. Tumor weight of HFD animals was greater than that of chow. LLC tumors reduced gastrocnemius, plantaris, and soleus mass, regardless of diet. The tibialis anterior and plantaris mass and cross-sectional area of type IIb/x fibers in the gastrocnemius were not different between HFD-chow, HFD-tumor, and chow-tumor. Using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of the plantaris muscle from chow-tumor and HFD-tumor groups, we identified ∼400 differentially expressed genes. Bioinformatic analysis identified changes in lipid metabolism, mitochondria, bioenergetics, and proteasome degradation. Atrophy was not greater despite larger tumor burden in animals fed an HFD, and RNA-seq data suggests that partial protection is mediated through differences in mitochondrial function and protein degradation, which may serve as future mechanistic targets.",

Twelve women and men with T2D were recruited and randomized to either a HP (30%protein, 30%fat, 40%carbohydrate) (n = 6) or HC (15%protein, 30%fat, 55%carbohydrate) (n = 6) diet feeding study for 6 months in this randomized controlled trial. All meals were purchased at local grocery stores and provided to subjects for 6 months with daily food menus for HP or HC compliance with weekly food pick-up and weight measurements. Oral glucose tolerance and meal tolerance tests with glucose and insulin measurements and DXA scans were done at baseline and after 6 months on the respective diets. After 6 months on the HP diet, 100% of the subjects had remission of their T2DM to Normal Glucose Tolerance (NGT), whereas only 16.6% of subjects on the HC diet had remission of their T2DM. The HP diet group exhibited significant improvement in a) cardiovascular risk factors (p = 0.004, b) inflammatory cytokines(p = 0.001), c) insulin sensitivity(p = 0.001), d) oxidative stress(p = 0.001), e) increased %lean body mass(p = 0.001) compared to the HC diet group at 6 months. A significant improvement in cardiovascular risk factors, inflammation, metabolic parameters and 100% remission of T2DM to NGT was achieved with a HP diet compared to a HC diet at 6 months.

    "abstract": "The review aims to explore the potential benefit and risk of high-protein diets (HPD) regarding the comorbidity of sarcopoenia and CVD in the setting of cardiac rehabilitation (CR). CR is standard care for individuals who have experienced a cardiac event, but the current practice of predominantly aerobic exercise, a lower-fat diet and weight loss poorly addresses the issue of sarcopoenia. HPD, especially when combined with resistance exercise (RE), may be valuable adjuncts to current CR practice and benefit both muscle and cardiovascular health. Meta-analyses and randomised controlled trials of HPD and CVD risk show beneficial but variable effects regarding weight loss, the lipid profile, insulin resistance and lean body mass in those living with or high risk of CVD. Meta-analyses of prospective cohort studies on hard CVD endpoints favour lower- and plant-protein diets over higher animal protein, but the evidence is inconsistent. HPD augment the strength and muscle gaining benefits of RE in older populations, but there are no published data in those living with CVD providing promising opportunities for CR research. HPD raise concern regarding renal and bone health, the microbiome, branched chain amino acids and environmental sustainability and findings suggest that plant-based HPD may confer ecological and overall health advantages compared to animal-based HPD. However, incorporating RE with HPD might alleviate certain health risks. In conclusion, a largely plant-based HPD is deemed favourable for CR when combined with RE, but further research regarding efficacy and safety in CR populations is needed.",

    "title": "Protein intake in cancer: Does it improve nutritional status and/or modify tumour response to chemotherapy?",
    "abstract": "Combating malnutrition and cachexia is a core challenge in oncology. To limit muscle mass loss, the use of proteins in cancer is encouraged by experts in the field, but it is still debated due to their antagonist effects. Indeed, a high protein intake could preserve lean body mass but may promote tumour growth, whereas a low-protein diet could reduce tumour size but without addressing cachexia. Here we used a realistic rodent model of cancer and chemotherapy to evaluate the influence of different protein intakes on cachexia, tumour response to chemotherapy and immune system response. The goal is to gain a closer understanding of the effect of protein intake in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. Female Fischer 344 rats were divided into six groups: five groups (n = 14 per group) with cancer (Ward colon tumour) and chemotherapy were fed with isocaloric diets with 8%, 12%, 16%, 24% or 32% of caloric intake from protein and one healthy control group (n = 8) fed a 16% protein diet, considered as a standard diet. Chemotherapy included two cycles, 1 week apart, each consisting of an injection of CPT-11 (50 mg/kg) followed by 5-fluorouracil (50 mg/kg) the day after. Food intake, body weight, and tumour size were measured daily. On day 9, the rats were euthanized and organs were weighed. Body composition was determined and protein content and protein synthesis (SUnSET method) were measured in the muscle, liver, intestine, and tumour. Immune function was explored by flow cytometry. Cancer and chemotherapy led to a decrease in body weight characterized by a decrease of both fat mass (-56 ± 3%, P < 0.05) and fat-free mass (-8 ± 1%, P < 0.05). Surprisingly, there was no effect of protein diet on body composition, muscle or tumour parameters (weight, protein content, or protein synthesis) but a high cumulative protein intake was positively associated with a high relative body weight and high fat-free mass. The immune system was impacted by cancer and chemotherapy but not by the different amount of protein intake. Using a realistic model of cancer and chemotherapy, we demonstrated for the first time that protein intake did not positively or negatively modulate tumour growth. Moreover, our results suggested that a high cumulative protein intake was able to improve moderately nutritional status in chemotherapy treated cancer rodents. Although this work cannot be evaluated clinically for ethical reasons, it nevertheless brings an essential contribution to nutrition management for cancer patients.",

High-protein (HP) diets are commonly used for weight loss, but whether protein sources, especially red meat, impact weight loss-induced T2D management is unknown. This trial compared an HP diet including beef and a normal-protein (NP) diet without red meat for weight loss, body composition changes, and glucose control in individuals with T2D. A total of 106 adults (80 female) with T2D consumed an HP (40% protein) diet with ≥4 weekly servings of lean beef or an NP (21% protein) diet excluding red meat during a 52-week weight loss intervention. Body weight, body composition, and cardiometabolic parameters were measured before and after intervention. Weight loss was not different between the HP (-10.2 ± 1.6 kg) and NP (-12.7 ± 4.8 kg, p = 0.336) groups. Both groups reduced fat mass and increased fat-free mass percent. Hemoglobin A1c, glucose, insulin, insulin resistance, blood pressure, and triglycerides improved, with no differences between groups. The lack of observed effects of dietary protein and red meat consumption on weight loss and improved cardiometabolic health suggests that achieved weight loss, rather than diet composition, should be the principal target of dietary interventions for T2D management.",

    "abstract": "Obesity has become a major health issue in dogs. Obesity in dogs increases the risk of many chronic diseases and chronic low-grade inflammation. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of a therapeutic weight loss (TWL) diet on weight loss and metabolic health in overweight and obese dogs. Thirty overweight and obese dogs were randomized into two groups with 15 dogs per group based on key baseline (BSL) parameters and allotted to either a control or TWL diet for 6 mo. At the start of the study, the control group had six females and nine males with mean age of 9.12 ± 0.48 (mean ± SEM) yr; there were seven females and eight males with mean age of 9.73 ± 0.63 yr in the TWL group. The control group and the TWL group had comparable body weight (34.78 ± 0.76 and 34.63 ± 0.86 kg, respectively), % body fat (BF; 39.77 ± 1.18 and 39.89 ± 0.93, respectively), and body condition score (BCS; 7.80 ± 0.14 and 7.67 ± 0.16 on a 9-point BCS scale, respectively). The control (CTRL) diet was formulated based on the macronutrient ratio of a commercial metabolic diet, and the TWL diet was enriched with dietary protein, fish oil, and soy germ meal. Both diets were fortified with essential nutrients to account for caloric restriction during weight loss. Dogs were fed with 25% less than BSL maintenance energy requirement (MER) for the first 4 mo and if they did not reach a BCS of 5, they were fed 40% less than BSL MER for the last 2 mo. Body composition was determined by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Postprandial glucose profiles were determined by continuous glucose monitoring devices. Serum samples were collected for analyses of blood parameters, hormones, and cytokines. All data were analyzed using SAS 9.3, with significance being P < 0.05. At the end of the study, the control group and the TWL group had comparable weight loss (-5.77 ± 0.31 and -6.14 ± 0.32 kg, respectively; P = 0.4080). But the TWL group lost significantly (P = 0.034) more BF (-13.27 ± 1.28%) than the control group (-9.90 ± 1.23%). In addition, the TWL diet completely prevented loss of lean body mass (LBM) in dogs compared with BSL. Dogs fed with the TWL diet had significantly lower fasting serum cholesterol, triglycerides, insulin, leptin, mean postprandial interstitial glucose, and pro-inflammatory cytokines compared with dogs fed with the CTRL diet. In summary, the TWL diet prevented loss of LBM, promoted weight loss and metabolic health, and reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in overweight and obese dogs during weight loss. Obesity has become a major health issue in dogs and increases the risk of many chronic diseases and chronic low-grade inflammation. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of a therapeutic weight loss (TWL) diet on weight loss and metabolic health in overweight and obese dogs.

Changes in body composition were determined every 2 mo. Blood samples were collected to measure changes in lipid profiles, hormones, cytokines, and chemokines. Postprandial glucose profiles were determined by a continuous glucose monitoring system. The results of the study showed that the TWL diet completely prevented loss of lean body mass (LBM) in dogs compared with baseline. Dogs fed with the TWL diet had significantly lower fasting serum cholesterol, triglycerides, insulin, leptin, mean postprandial glucose, and pro-inflammatory cytokines compared with dogs fed with the CTRL diet.

    "abstract": "Optimal body mass and composition as well as metabolic fitness require tightly regulated and interconnected mechanisms across tissues. Disturbances in these regulatory networks tip the balance between metabolic health versus overweight and obesity and their complications. The authors previously demonstrated roles for the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) in obesity, as global- or adipocyte-specific deletion of Ager (the gene encoding RAGE) protected mice from high-fat diet-induced obesity and metabolic dysfunction. To explore translational strategies evoked by these observations, a small molecule antagonist of RAGE signaling, RAGE229, was administered to lean mice and mice with obesity undergoing diet-induced weight loss. Body mass and composition and whole body and adipose tissue metabolism were examined. This study demonstrates that antagonism of RAGE signaling reduced body mass and adiposity and improved glucose, insulin, and lipid metabolism in lean male and female mice and in male mice with obesity undergoing weight loss. In adipose tissue and in human and mouse adipocytes, RAGE229 enhanced phosphorylation of protein kinase A substrates, which augmented lipolysis, mitochondrial function, and thermogenic programs. Pharmacological antagonism of RAGE signaling is a potent strategy to optimize healthful body mass and composition and metabolic fitness.",

    "abstract": "Observational studies have shown that energy restriction could be beneficial for controlling bodyweight in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). We aim to compare the effects of a high-protein diet (HPD), a high-protein and high-dietary fiber diet (HPHFD), and a calorie-restricted diet (CRD) on metabolic health and gut microbiota in overweight/obese PCOS patients. We will enroll a total of 90 overweight/obese PCOS patients into this eight-week open-label randomised controlled trial. Participants will be randomly assigned to three groups: CRD group (energy coefficient 20 kcal/kg.day, water ≥1500 mL, 0.8-1.2 g/kg protein, carbohydrate energize 55-60%, and fat energize 25-30%), HDP group (energy coefficient 20 kcal/kg.day, water ≥1500 mL, and 1.5-2.0 g/kg protein) and HPHFD group (based on the high protein diet with 15 g more dietary fiber supplement). The primary outcome is body weight, body fat percentage, and lean body mass. The secondary outcomes will include changes in blood lipids, inflammation, glucose tolerance, blood pressure, and gut microbiota compositions. Between-group differences in adiposity measurements at baseline will be compared using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or Kruskal-Wallis test when appropriate. Within-group difference after 8-week intervention will be compared using paired t-test or Wilcoxon signed rank test. Between-group differences in adiposity measurements after 8-week diet intervention will be compared using linear mixed model and ANCOVA. The gut microbiota will be analyzed using 16S amplicon sequencing and the sequencing data will be analyzed using the standardized QIIME2 piperline.",

    "abstract": "Branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) showed multiple functions in glycolipid metabolism and protein synthesis. However, the impacts on the metabolic health of low or high dietary BCAA remain controversial due to the various experimental conditions. Gradient levels of BCAA were supplemented in lean mice for four weeks: 0BCAA (without BCAA), 1/2BCAA (half BCAA), 1BCAA (regular BCAA), and 2BCAA (double BCAA). The results showed that the diet without BCAA caused energy metabolic disorders, immune defects, weight loss, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperleptinemia. 1/2BCAA and 2BCAA diets reduced body fat percentage, but 1/2 BCAA also decreased muscle mass. 1/2BCAA and 2BCAA groups improved lipid and glucose metabolism by affecting metabolic genes. Meanwhile, significant differences between low and high dietary BCAA were observed. The results of this study provide evidence and reference for the controversy about dietary BCAA levels, which indicates that the main difference between low and high BCAA dietary levels may present in the longer term.",

    "abstract": "Canine obesity negatively influences health and well-being, but can be managed by altering diet composition and caloric intake. Restricted feeding, dietary intervention, and consequent weight loss may be used to improve health and modify gastrointestinal microbiota. In this study, we aimed to determine the effects of restricted feeding of specially formulated foods on weight loss, body composition, voluntary physical activity, serum hormones and oxidative stress markers, and fecal metabolites and microbiota populations of obese dogs. Twenty-four obese dogs [body weight (BW) = 15.2 ± 1.7 kg; body condition score (BCS) = 8.7 ± 0.4; muscle condition score (MCS) = 3.5 ± 0.3; age = 7.2 ± 1.6 yr] were used in a 24-wk study. A control (OR) food was fed during a 4-wk baseline to identify intake needed to maintain BW. After baseline, dogs were allotted to one of two diets: OR or test (FT), and then fed to lose 1.5% BW/wk. Food intake, BW, BCS, and MCS were measured, blood and fecal samples were collected, DEXA scans were performed, and voluntary physical activity was measured over time. Microbiota data were evaluated using QIIME2 and change from baseline data from other measures were evaluated using the Mixed Models procedure of SAS, with P < 0.05 being significant. Restricted feeding led to reduced BW, BCS, fat mass, and blood cholesterol, triglyceride, glucose, and leptin concentrations, and increased MCS and lean body mass percentage. Blood cholesterol reduction was greater in dogs fed FT vs. OR. Fecal metabolites and bacterial alpha-diversity were affected by diet and weight loss. Dogs fed FT had greater reductions in fecal short-chain fatty acid, branched-chain fatty acid, and ammonia concentrations than those fed OR. Dogs fed OR had a higher alpha-diversity than those fed FT. Weight loss increased alpha-diversity (weeks 16, 20, and 24 > weeks 0 and 4). Beta-diversity showed separation between dietary groups and between week 0 and all other time points after week 8. Weight loss increased fecal Allobaculum and Ruminococcus torques. Weight loss also increased fecal Bifidobacterium, Faecalibaculum, and Parasutterella, but were greater in dogs fed OR. Weight loss decreased fecal Collinsella, Turicibacter, Blautia, Ruminococcus gnavus, Faecalibacterium, and Peptoclostridium, but were greater in dogs fed OR. In summary, restricted feeding promoted safe weight and fat loss, reduced blood lipid and leptin concentrations, and altered fecal microbiota of obese dogs. In this study, we aimed to determine the effects of restricted feeding of specially formulated foods on weight loss, body composition, voluntary physical activity, serum hormones and oxidative stress markers, and fecal metabolites and microbiota populations of obese dogs. A control (OR) food was fed during a 4-wk baseline to identify intake needed to maintain the body weight (BW). After baseline, dogs were allotted to one of two diets: OR or test (FT) and then fed to lose 1.5% BW per week for 24 wk. Restricted feeding and weight loss led to reduced BW, body condition score, fat mass, and blood cholesterol, triglyceride, glucose and leptin concentrations and increased muscle condition score and lean body mass percentage. The reduction in blood cholesterol was greater in dogs fed FT vs. OR. Fecal metabolites and bacterial alpha-diversity were affected by diet and weight loss, with dogs fed with OR having a higher alpha-diversity than those fed with FT. Restricted feeding and weight loss increased alpha-diversity, affected beta-diversity, and impacted the relative abundances of nearly 20 bacterial genera. In summary, restricted feeding with high-protein, low-starch kibble diets promoted safe weight and fat loss, reduced blood lipid and leptin concentrations, and altered fecal microbiota of obese dogs.",

    "abstract": "Consumption of unprocessed red meat in randomized trials has no adverse effects on cardiovascular risk factors and body weight, but its physiological effects during weight loss maintenance are not known. We sought to investigate the effects of healthy diets that include small or large amounts of red meat on the maintenance of lost weight after successful weight loss, and secondarily on body composition (DXA), resting energy expenditure (REE; indirect calorimetry), and cardiometabolic risk factors. In this 5-mo parallel randomized intervention trial, 108 adults with BMI 28-40 kg/m2 (45 males/63 females) underwent an 8-wk rapid weight loss period, and those who lost ≥8% body weight (n = 80) continued to ad libitum weight maintenance diets for 12 wk: a moderate-protein diet with 25 g beef/d (B25, n = 45) or a high-protein diet with 150 g beef/d (B150, n = 35). In per protocol analysis (n = 69), mean body weight (-1.2 kg; 95% CI: -2.1, -0.3 kg), mean fat mass (-2.7 kg; 95% CI: -3.4, -2.0 kg), and mean body fat content (-2.6%; 95% CI: -3.1, -2.1%) decreased during the maintenance phase, whereas mean lean mass (1.5 kg; 95% CI: 1.0, 2.0 kg) and mean REE (51 kcal/d; 95% CI: 15, 86 kcal/d) increased, with no differences between groups (all P > 0.05). Results were similar in intention-to-treat analysis with multiple imputation for dropouts (20 from B150 compared with 19 from B25, P = 0.929). Changes in cardiometabolic risk factors were not different between groups, the general pattern being a decrease during weight loss and a return to baseline during weight maintenance (and despite the additional mild reduction in weight and fat mass). Healthy diets consumed ad libitum that contain a little or a lot of unprocessed beef have similar effects on body weight, energy metabolism, and cardiovascular risk factors during the first 3 mo after clinically significant rapid weight loss.",

    "title": "Combination of Caloric Restriction and a Mixed Training Protocol as an Effective Strategy to Counteract the Deleterious Effects in Trabecular Bone Microarchitecture Caused by a Diet-Induced Obesity in Sprague Dawley Rats.",
    "abstract": "The association of obesity with changes in bone mass is not clear. Obese individuals tend to have an increased bone mineral density, but other studies have shown that obesity is a major risk factor for fractures. The mechanisms of bone response during a weight loss therapy as well as the possible osteoprotective effect of exercise should be analyzed. The aim of this study was to test the effects of a weight-loss program based on the combination of caloric restriction and/or a mixed training protocol on different parameters of bone morphology and functionality in a DIO rat model. Three stages were established over a 21-week period (obesity induction 0-12 w, weight loss intervention 12-15 w, weight maintenance intervention 15-21 w) in 88 male Sprague Dawley rats. Bone microarchitecture, total mineral and elemental composition, and bone metabolism parameters were assessed. Weight loss interventions were associated to healthy changes in body composition, decreasing body fat and increasing lean body mass. On the other hand, obesity was related to a higher content of bone resorption and inflammatory markers, which was decreased by the weight control interventions. Caloric restriction led to marked changes in trabecular microarchitecture, with a significant decrease in total volume but no changes in bone volume (BV). In addition, the intervention diet caused an increase in trabeculae number and a decrease in trabecular spacing. The training protocol increased the pore diameter and reversed the changes in cortical porosity and density of BV induced by the high protein diet at diaphysis level. Regarding the weight-maintenance stage, diminished SMI values indicate the presence of more plate-like spongiosa in sedentary and exercise groups. In conclusion, the lifestyle interventions of caloric restriction and mixed training protocol implemented as weight loss strategies have been effective to counteract some of the deleterious effects caused by a dietary induction of obesity, specifically in trabecular bone morphometric parameters as well as bone mineral content.",

    "abstract": "The presence of malnutrition is increasingly becoming a postdischarge problem in surgical patients. We aimed to investigate whether oral nutritional supplements combined with resistance training could minimize skeletal muscle atrophy in surgical patients after discharge. This randomized controlled study was conducted at the Department of Surgery, National Hospital of Faroe Islands from 2018 to 2020. A total of 45 patients aged 37−74 years participated and were allocated to one of three groups: diet (DI; n = 13), exercise and diet (EX + DI; n = 16), or control (CON; n = 16). The intervention period lasted 8 weeks. The intervention groups received individual dietary counselling and a protein-rich oral nutritional supplement twice a day containing 22 g of protein/day. Patients in the EX + DI group were assigned to resistance training sessions. Patients in the CON group received standard care. The primary outcome was change in lean body mass (LBM). Secondary outcomes were change in body weight, handgrip strength, quality of life, surgery-related side effects, energy and protein intake, length of stay and one-year mortality. To estimate within-group changes, linear mixed models including group−time interactions as fixed effects and patients as random effects were fitted. Within-group change in LBM was 233, 813 and 78 g in the DI, EX + DI and CON groups, respectively, with no significant between-group difference (p > 0.05). Pain score declined more (p = 0.04) in the EX + DI group compared with the CON group. Body weight, handgrip strength, quality of life and surgery-related side effects did not differ between groups. At the end of study, mean cumulative weight change in the DI and EX + DI groups was 0.4% and 1.6%, respectively, whereas the CON group experienced a weight loss of −0.6%. No significant difference in primary outcome between groups was noted. However, our results indicate some benefits from exercise and nutrition for malnourished surgical patients.",

    "abstract": "Insulin resistance is a major public health burden that often results in other comorbidities including type 2 diabetes, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and cardiovascular disease. An insulin sensitizer has the potential to become a disease-modifying therapy. It remains an unmet medical need to identify therapeutics that target the insulin signaling pathway to treat insulin resistance. Low-molecular-weight protein tyrosine phosphatase (LMPTP) negatively regulates insulin signaling and has emerged as a potential therapeutic target for insulin sensitization. Genetic studies have demonstrated that LMPTP is positively associated with obesity in humans and promotes insulin resistance in rodents. A recent study showed that pharmacological inhibition or genetic deletion of LMPTP protects mice from high-fat diet-induced insulin resistance and diabetes. Here, we show that loss of LMPTP by genetic deletion has no significant effects on improving glucose tolerance in lean or diet-induced obese mice. Furthermore, our data demonstrate that LMPTP deficiency potentiates cardiac hypertrophy that leads to mild cardiac dysfunction. Our findings suggest that the development of LMPTP inhibitors for the treatment of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes should be reevaluated, and further studies are needed to characterize the molecular and pathophysiological role of LMPTP.",

    "title": "Nutrition policy: developing scientific recommendations for food-based dietary guidelines for older adults living independently in Ireland.",
    "abstract": "Older adults (≥65 years) are the fastest growing population group. Thus, ensuring nutritional well-being of the 'over-65s' to optimise health is critically important. Older adults represent a diverse population - some are fit and healthy, others are frail and many live with chronic conditions. Up to 78% of older Irish adults living independently are overweight or obese. The present paper describes how these issues were accommodated into the development of food-based dietary guidelines for older adults living independently in Ireland. Food-based dietary guidelines previously established for the general adult population served as the basis for developing more specific recommendations appropriate for older adults. Published international reports were used to update nutrient intake goals for older adults, and available Irish data on dietary intakes and nutritional status biomarkers were explored from a population-based study (the National Adult Nutrition Survey; NANS) and two longitudinal cohorts: the Trinity-Ulster and Department of Agriculture (TUDA) and the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA) studies. Nutrients of public health concern were identified for further examination. While most nutrient intake goals were similar to those for the general adult population, other aspects were identified where nutritional concerns of ageing require more specific food-based dietary guidelines. These include, a more protein-dense diet using high-quality protein foods to preserve muscle mass; weight maintenance in overweight or obese older adults with no health issues and, where weight-loss is required, that lean tissue is preserved; the promotion of fortified foods, particularly as a bioavailable source of B vitamins and the need for vitamin D supplementation.",

    "title": "Lean mass sparing in resistance-trained athletes during caloric restriction: the role of resistance training volume.",
    "abstract": "Many sports employ caloric restriction (CR) to reduce athletes' body mass. During these phases, resistance training (RT) volume is often reduced to accommodate recovery demands. Since RT volume is a well-known anabolic stimulus, this review investigates whether a higher training volume helps to spare lean mass during CR. A total of 15 studies met inclusion criteria. The extracted data allowed calculation of total tonnage lifted (repetitions × sets × intensity load) or weekly sets per muscle group for only 4 of the 15 studies, with RT volume being highly dependent on the examined muscle group as well as weekly training frequency per muscle group. Studies involving high RT volume programs (≥ 10 weekly sets per muscle group) revealed low-to-no (mostly female) lean mass loss. Additionally, studies increasing RT volume during CR over time appeared to demonstrate no-to-low lean mass loss when compared to studies reducing RT volume. Since data regarding RT variables applied were incomplete in most of the included studies, evidence is insufficient to conclude that a higher RT volume is better suited to spare lean mass during CR, although data seem to favor higher volumes in female athletes during CR. Moreover, the data appear to suggest that increasing RT volume during CR over time might be more effective in ameliorating CR-induced atrophy in both male and female resistance-trained athletes when compared to studies reducing RT volume. The effects of CR on lean mass sparing seem to be mediated by training experience, pre-diet volume, and energy deficit, with, on average, women tending to spare more lean mass than men. Potential explanatory mechanisms for enhanced lean mass sparing include a preserved endocrine milieu as well as heightened anabolic signaling.",

    "abstract": "Cardiogenic shock is defined as tissue hypoperfusion due to cardiac dysfunction. It is associated with hemodynamic unstability and elevated arterial lactate as one indicator for anaerobic metabolism. Hypercatabolic state in this condition leads to increasing nutritional requirement and negative nitrogen balance. Therefore, medical nutrition therapy by considering metabolic tolerance can prevent further metabolic deterioration and loss of lean mass and improve the patient's clinical outcome. A 44-years-old female patient with severe protein-energy malnutrition (Subjective Global Assessment Score C; MUAC 15cm) suffered from hemodynamic unstability due to cardiogenic shock and infected bronchiectasis at the infection center of Wahidin Sudirohusodo Hospital. Intake was postponed due to mean arterial pressure 56mmHg on vasopressor support and oxygen saturation below 93%. Physical examinations showed loss of subcutaneous fat, lung crackles and wheezing, muscle wasting, and pretibial edema. Laboratory assessments showed elevated arterial lactate (3.2mmol/L), hypoalbuminemia (2.4g/dL), lymphocytopenia (650/μL), elevated liver enzymes (SGOT 780U/L; SGPT 868U/L), and urine urea nitrogen (5g/24h). Nutritional therapy was started after mean arterial pressure ≥65mmHg with a stable dosage of the vasopressor drug and decreased arterial lactate level to 2.2mmol/L then given gradually with a target calorie of 1500kcal and protein 1.5-1.8g/kg ideal body weight/day using high protein diet. Arterial lactate and blood gass analyses were controlled every day to determine the target of nutritional therapy day by the day. Snakehead fish extract, zinc, vitamin B complex, Thiamine, vitamin C, vitamin A, vitamin D3, and Curcumin were supplied. After 15 days of nutritional therapy, the patient was discharged from the hospital with stable hemodynamic without vasopressor support, adequate nutritional intake, improvement of anthropometric parameters, and laboratory test results (arterial lactate 1.6mmol/L, albumin 3.1g/dL, lymphocyte 1.871/μL, SGOT 34U/L, SGPT 41U/L, urine urea nitrogen 0.72g/24h). Adequate nutritional therapy, which is planned by evaluating hemodynamic tolerance, can improve patient clinical outcomes and positive nitrogen balance in the hemodynamically unstable patient.",

    "abstract": "We investigated the effects of a novel multi-ingredient supplement comprised of polyphenol antioxidants and compounds known to facilitate mitochondrial function and metabolic enhancement (ME) in a mouse model of obesity. In this study, 6-week-old male C57/BL6J mice were placed on a high-fat diet (HFD; ~60% fat) for 6 weeks, with subsequent allocation into experimentalgroups for 4 weeks: HFD control, HFD + ME10 (10 components), HFD + ME7 (7 components), HFD + ME10 + EX, HFD + EX (where '+EX' animals exercised 3 days/week), and chow-fed control. After the intervention, HFD control animals had significantly greater body weight and fat mass. Despite the continuation of HFD, animals supplemented with multi-ingredient ME or who performed exercise training showed an attenuation of fat mass and preservation of lean body mass, which was further enhanced when combined (ME+EX). ME supplementation stimulated the upregulation of white and brown adipose tissue mRNA transcripts associated with mitochondrial biogenesis, browning, fatty acid transport, and fat metabolism. In WAT depots, this was mirrored by mitochodrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) protein expression, and increased in vivo fat oxidation measured via CLAMS. ME supplementation also decreased systemic and local inflammation markers. Herein, we demonstrated that novel multi-ingredient nutritional supplements induced significant fat loss independent of physical activity while preserving muscle mass in obese mice. Mechanistically, these MEs appear to act by inducing a browning program in white adipose tissue and decreasing other pathophysiological impairments associated with obesity, including mitochondrial respiration alterations induced by HFD.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate whether the lack of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) in mature adipocytes of obese mice (Stat5Adipoq mice) improves glucose and lipid metabolism as previously observed in lean mice. Male Stat5Adipoq mice and their wild type (WT) littermates were fed high-fat diet (HFD). Effects of adipocyte STAT5 deficiency on adiposity as well as on glucose and lipid metabolism were determined under ad libitum feeding and after weight loss induced by calorie restriction. Compared to WT mice, obese Stat5Adipoq mice showed modestly accelerated weight gain and blunted depletion of fat stores under calorie restriction (reduction in % body fat after 3 weeks: WT, -9.3±1.1, vs Stat5Adipoq, -5.9±0.8, p = 0.04). No differences were observed between Stat5Adipoq and WT mice with regard to parameters of glucose and lipid metabolism including basal glycaemia, glucose tolerance, and plasma triglycerides. In conclusion, STAT5 deficiency in the adipocyte of HFD-fed obese mice was associated with increased fat accumulation. In contrast to previous findings in lean mice, however, lipid accumulation was not associated with any improvement in glucose and lipid metabolism. Our results do not support adipocyte STAT5 as a promising target for the treatment of obesity-associated metabolic derangements.",

    "abstract": "A ketogenic diet (KD) is a nutritional approach, usually adopted for weight loss, that restricts daily carbohydrates under 30 g/day. KD showed contradictory results on sport performance, whilst no data are available on team sports. We sought to investigate the influence of a KD on different parameters in semi-professional soccer players. Subjects were randomly assigned to a iso-protein (1.8 g/Kg body weight/day) ketogenic diet (KD) or western diet (WD) for 30 days. Body weight and body composition, resting energy expenditure (REE), respiratory exchange ratio (RER), cross sectional area (CSA) and isometric muscle strength of quadriceps, counter movement jump (CMJ) and yoyo intermittent recovery test time were measured. There was a significantly higher decrease of body fat (p = 0.0359), visceral adipose tissue (VAT) (p = 0.0018), waist circumference (p = 0.0185) and extra-cellular water (p = 0.0060) in KD compared to WD group. Lean soft tissue, quadriceps muscle area, maximal strength and REE showed no changes in both groups. RER decreased significantly in KD (p = 0.0008). Yo-yo intermittent test improved significantly (p < 0.0001) in both groups without significant differences between groups. CMJ significantly improved (p = 0.0021) only in KD. This is the first study investigating the effects of a KD on semi-professional soccer players. In our study KD athletes lost fat mass without any detrimental effects on strength, power and muscle mass.

    "abstract": "Menopausal women are susceptible to osteoarthritis(OA) and memory impairment. We hypothesised that Alzheimer's-like disease(AD) exacerbates OA and that intermittent fasting(IMF) with a high-protein(H-P) diet would enhance memory function and relieve OA symptoms in oestrogen-deficient animals induced AD and OA. The action mechanism was also explored. Ovariectomised Sprague-Dawley rats were fed high-fat(H-F) or H-P diets for 2 weeks, and then they had a hippocampal infusion of β-amyloid(25-35) for 4 weeks to induce AD and an injection of monoidoacetate(MIA) into the articular cartilage to induce OA. Non-AD groups had non-AD symptoms by hippocampal amyloid-β(35-25) infusion. IMF suppressed memory impairment in AD rats, especially those fed H-P diets. Compared with non-AD, AD exacerbated OA symptoms, including swelling, limping, slowed treadmill running speed, and uneven weight distribution in the left leg. The exacerbations were linked to increased inflammation and pain, but IMF and H-P lessened the exacerbation. Lean body mass(LBM) decreased with AD, but H-P protected against LBM loss. Histological examination of the knee joint revealed the degree of the cellular invasion into the middle zone, and the changes in the tidemark plateau were greatest in the AD-AL with H-F, while non-AD-IMF improved the cellular invasion to as much as non-AD-AL. H-P reduced the infiltration into the middle zone of the knee and promoted collagen production. In conclusion, AD exacerbated the articular cartilage deterioration and memory impairment, and IMF with H-P alleviated the memory impairment and osteoarthritic symptoms by decreasing hippocampal amyloid-β deposition and proinflammatory cytokine expressions and by increasing LBM.",

    "abstract": "Branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) supplementation has been shown to increase muscle mass or prevent muscle loss during weight loss. We aimed to investigate the effects of a BCAA-supplemented hypocaloric diet on lean mass preservation and insulin sensitivity. A total of 132 Chinese adults (63 men and 69 women aged 21-45 y, BMI 25-36 kg/m2) were block randomly assigned by gender and BMI into 3 hypocaloric diet (deficit of 500 kcal/d) groups: standard-protein (14%) with placebo (control, CT) or BCAA supplements at 0.1 g · kg-1 body weight · d-1 (BCAA) or high-protein (27%) with placebo (HP). The subjects underwent 16 wk of dietary intervention with provision of meals and supplements, followed by 8 wk of weight maintenance with provision of supplements only. One-way ANOVA analysis was conducted to analyze the primary (lean mass and insulin sensitivity) and secondary outcomes (anthropometric and metabolic parameters) among the 3 groups. Paired t-test was used to analyze the change in each group. The 3 groups demonstrated similar significant reductions in body weight (7.97%), fat mass (13.8%), and waist circumference (7.27%) after 16 wk of energy deficit. Lean mass loss in BCAA (4.39%) tended to be lower than in CT (5.39%) and higher compared with HP (3.67%) (P = 0.06). Calf muscle volume increased 3.4% in BCAA and intramyocellular lipids (IMCLs) decreased in BCAA (17%) and HP (18%) (P < 0.05) over 16 wk. During the 8 wk weight maintenance period, lean mass gain in BCAA (1.03%) tended to be lower compared with CT (1.58%) and higher than in HP (-0.002%) (P = 0.04). Lean mass gain differed significantly between CT and HP (P = 0.03). Insulin sensitivity and metabolic profiles did not differ among the groups throughout the study period. BCAA supplementation does not preserve lean mass or affect insulin sensitivity in overweight and obese adults during weight loss. A higher protein diet may be more advantageous for lean mass preservation.",

    "abstract": "We aimed to determine whether the sodium/glucose cotransporter family member SGLT3, a proposed glucose sensor, is expressed in the intestine and/or kidney, and if its expression is altered in mouse models of obesity and in humans before and after weight-loss surgery. We used in-situ hybridization and quantitative PCR to determine whether the Sglt3 isoforms 3a and 3b were expressed in the intestine and kidney of C57, leptin-deficient ob/ob, and diabetic BTBR ob/ob mice. Western blotting and immunohistochemistry were also used to assess SGLT3 protein levels in jejunal biopsies from obese patients before and after weight-loss Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (RYGB), and in lean healthy controls. Sglt3a/3b mRNA was detected in the small intestine (duodenum, jejunum and ileum), but not in the large intestine or kidneys of mice. Both isoforms were detected in epithelial cells (confirmed using intestinal organoids). Expression of Sglt3a/3b mRNA in duodenum and jejunum was significantly lower in ob/ob and BTBR ob/ob mice than in normal-weight littermates. Jejunal SGLT3 protein levels in aged obese patients before RYGB were lower than in lean individuals, but substantially upregulated 6 months post-RYGB. Our study shows that Sglt3a/3b is expressed primarily in epithelial cells of the small intestine in mice. Furthermore, we observed an association between intestinal mRNA Sglt3a/3b expression and obesity in mice, and between jejunal SGLT3 protein levels and obesity in humans. Further studies are required to determine the possible role of SGLT3 in obesity.",

    "abstract": "Yogurt has been widely used in weight-loss foods to prevent obesity, but its molecular nature remains unclear. Lactate is a major ingredient of yogurt, while its cognate cell surface receptor GPR81 is highly expressed in adipose tissues in mammals. Here we hypothesized that dietary lactate supplementation might activate GPR81 to promote adipose browning. Studying mouse models, we observed that GPR81 was substantially lowered in adipose tissue of obese mice compared with that for lean ones, whereas its expression was markedly up-regulated by a β3-adrenergic receptor (β3-AR) agonist. The deficiency of GPR81 greatly attenuated experimental adipose browning and thermogenesis. Importantly, oral administration of lactate effectively induced adipose browning, enhanced thermogenesis, improved dyslipidemia, and protected mice against high-fat-diet-induced obesity. Mechanistically, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase might serve as a key downstream effect or of GPR81. Collectively, our findings revealed a critical role of GPR81 in adipose browning and provided a new insight into obesity management by modulating lactate-GPR81 signaling axis.",

However, whether this relationship exists in trained females is unknown. This study examined the impact of higher compared to lower protein intakes (35% versus 15% of energy intake) on body composition in trained females during 2 weeks of severe ER. Eighteen well-trained females completed a 1-week energy balanced diet (HD100), followed by a 2-week hypoenergetic (40% ER) diet (HD60). During HD60, participants consumed either a high protein (HP; 35% protein, 15% fat) or lower protein (CON; 15% protein, 35% fat) diet. Body composition, peak power, leg strength, sprint time, and anaerobic endurance were assessed at baseline, pre-HD60, and post-HD60. Absolute protein intake was reduced during HD60 in the CON group (from 1.6 to 0.9 g·d·kgBM The preservation of LBM during HD60, irrespective of whether absolute protein intake is maintained or reduced, contrasts with findings in trained males. In trained females, the relationship between absolute protein intake and LBM change during ER warrants further investigation. Future recommendations for protein intake during ER should be expressed relative to body mass, not total energy intake, in trained females.",

    "abstract": "Combinatorial therapies are under intense investigation to develop more efficient anti-obesity drugs; however, little is known about how they act in the brain to produce enhanced anorexia and weight loss. The goal of this study was to identify the brain sites and neuronal populations engaged during the co-administration of GLP-1R and CCK1R agonists, an efficient combination therapy in obese rodents. We measured acute and long-term feeding and body weight responses and neuronal activation patterns throughout the neuraxis and in specific neuronal subsets in response to GLP-1R and CCK1R agonists administered alone or in combination in lean and high-fat diet fed mice. We used PhosphoTRAP to obtain unbiased molecular markers for neuronal populations selectively activated by the combination of the two agonists. The initial anorectic response to GLP-1R and CCK1R co-agonism was mediated by a reduction in meal size, but over a few hours, a reduction in meal number accounted for the sustained feeding suppressive effects. The nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) is one of the few brain sites where GLP-1R and CCK1R signalling interact to produce enhanced neuronal activation. None of the previously categorised NTS neuronal subpopulations relevant to feeding behaviour were implicated in this increased activation. However, we identified NTS/AP Calcrl Collectively, these studies indicated that circuit-level integration of GLP-1R and CCK1R co-agonism in discrete brain nuclei including the NTS produces enhanced rapid and sustained appetite suppression and weight loss.",

    "abstract": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most common causes of hepatic disorders. It represents a wide range of chronic liver diseases in patients with no history of significant alcohol consumption, starting with simple steatosis and progressing towards non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, cirrhosis, and ultimately hepatocellular carcinoma. NAFLD is usually associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, metabolic syndrome, and obesity. This disease has mostly been studied in obese individuals; however, it has been widely reported and studied among the lean/non-obese population in recent years. The pathogenesis of NAFLD in non-obese patients is associated with various genetic predispositions, particularly a patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 3 G allele polymorphism, which results in the accumulation of triglyceride in the liver and resistance to insulin. Additionally, dietary factors such as high fructose consumption seem to play a substantial role in the pathology of non-obese NAFLD. Although there is not enough evidence on the treatment of NAFLD in non-obese patients, the standard approach is to advise altering one's lifestyle in order to diminish visceral adiposity. Dietary modification, weight loss, and increased physical activity are highly recommended. We aimed to review and summarize the existing information on the prevalence, pathogenesis, genetic predispositions, diagnosis, and treatment of NAFLD in non-obese patients according to the latest literature.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, very-low-energy diets (VLEDs) have been recognised as a viable strategy for improving the extent of weight loss and cardio-metabolic outcomes in people who are either overweight or obese. However, concerns exist regarding the reductions in lean body mass (LBM) during VLEDs, particularly in vulnerable demographic groups, such as middle-aged and older adults already prone to developing sarcopenia. Sarcopenia is itself associated with multiple adverse outcomes, including frailty, cardio-metabolic deterioration and increased mortality. Therefore, a number of studies investigating strategies to ameliorate this detrimental effect of VLEDs have attempted to address this concern. This narrative review explores the potential benefits and limitations of exercise and/or protein supplementation for LBM retention during VLEDs based on the available evidence. Current studies suggest that both protein supplementation and exercise training may result in improved LBM retention (and skeletal muscle function) during VLEDs. However, uncertainty remains concerning the interactions between intervention types, based on discordant outcomes reported in the literature and the heterogeneity of exercise modalities in achieving this particular outcome.",

    "abstract": "The melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) is a G protein-coupled receptor that plays major roles in the central control of energy balance. Loss-of-function mutations of MC4R constitute the most common monogenic cause of early-onset extreme obesity in humans, whereas gain-of-function mutations appear to be protective. In particular, two relatively frequent alleles carrying the non-synonymous coding mutations V103I or I251L are associated with lower risks of obesity and type-2 diabetes. Although V103I and I251L MC4Rs showed more efficient signalling in transfected cells, their specific effects in live animals remain unexplored. Here, we investigated whether the introduction of V103I and I251L mutations into the mouse MC4R leads to a lean phenotype and provides protection against an obesogenic diet. Using CRISPR/Cas9, we generated two novel strains of mice carrying single-nucleotide mutations into the mouse Mc4r which are identical to those present in V103I and I251L MCR4 human alleles, and studied their phenotypic outcomes in mice fed with normal chow or a high-fat diet. In particular, we measured body weight progression, food intake and adiposity. In addition, we analysed glucose homeostasis through glucose and insulin tolerance tests. We found that homozygous V103I females displayed shorter longitudinal length and decreased abdominal white fat, whereas homozygous I251L females were also shorter and leaner due to decreased weight in all white fat pads examined. Homozygous Mc4r Our results demonstrate that mice carrying V103I and I251L MC4R mutations displayed gain-of-function phenotypes that were more evident in females. However, hypermorphic MC4R mutants were as susceptible as their control littermates to the obesogenic and diabetogenic effects elicited by a long-term hypercaloric diet, highlighting the importance of healthy feeding habits even under favourable genetic conditions.",

    "abstract": "Dietary proteins have been used for years to treat obesity. Body weight loss is beneficial when it concerns fat mass, but loss of fat free mass - especially muscle might be detrimental. This occurs because protein breakdown predominates over synthesis, thus administering anabolic dietary compounds like proteins might counter fat free mass loss while allowing for fat mass loss.Indeed, varying the quantity of proteins will decrease muscle anabolic response and increase hyperphagia in rodents fed a low protein diet; but it will favor lean mass maintenance and promote satiety, in certain age groups of humans fed a high protein diet. Beyond protein quantity, protein source is an important metabolic regulator: whey protein and plant based diets exercize favorable effects on the risk of developing obesity, body composition, metabolic parameters or fat free mass preservation of obese patients. Specific amino-acids like branched chain amino acids (BCAA), methionine, tryptophan and its metabolites, and glutamate can also positively influence parameters and complications of obesity especially in rodent models, with less studies translating this in humans.Tuning the quality and quantity of proteins or even specific amino-acids can thus be seen as a potential therapeutic intervention on the body composition, metabolic syndrome parameters and appetite regulation of obese patients. Since these effects vary across age groups and much of the data comes from murine models, long-term prospective studies modulating proteins and amino acids in the human diet are needed.",

We included a population of MHOCh with ≤1 of the following criteria: waist circumference and blood pressure ≥90 percentile, triglycerides >150 mg/dL, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-c) <40 mg/dL, or impaired fasting glucose. After 12 months of intensive lifestyle modification, anthropometric measurements, glycemic and lipid profiles, adherence to the MedDiet, energy intake, PA, body composition, and carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) were analyzed. One hundred thirty-one MHOCh (70 boys and 61 girls; P = 0.65, age: 7.9 ± 1.3 years, body mass index [BMI]: 24.7 ± 3.5 kg/m2) were included. After 12 months of intervention, a significant decrease in standard deviation (SD) units of body weight (-0.5 ± 0.1; P < 0.001) and BMI (-0.5 ± 0.1; P < 0.001) were observed in the total population. A significant improvement in adherence to the MedDiet (+2 points) and a significant reduction in protein, fatty acids, total fat, and cholesterol intake in the entire population were observed. All participants did more moderate-vigorous PA, which led to a significant increase in lean and total mass and decrease in total fat. Significant improvements in the glycemic profile (insulin levels [-6.6 μIU/mL, P < 0.001] and HOMA index [-1.2, P < 0.001]) were observed. Participants with pathological cIMT values reduced this cardiovascular predictor to normal values. A 12-month lifestyle modification intervention involving weight loss with MedDiet and PA in MHOCh yielded improvements in MedDiet adherence, lipid intake, moderate-vigorous PA, body composition, insulin resistance, and cIMT.",

    "title": "Exercise and Protein Effects on Strength and Function with Weight Loss in Older Women.",
    "abstract": "Obesity negatively affects lower extremity physical function (LEPF) in older adults. Exercise and a higher protein diet are both known to positively and independently affect body composition, muscle strength, and LEPF during weight loss; however, their potential interactive effects have not been well characterized in older women. The aim of this study was to determine the relative efficacy of a higher protein diet with or without exercise to improve body composition, muscle strength, and LEPF in older inactive overweight/obese women after weight loss. Postmenopausal women (body mass index = 31.1 ± 5.1 kg·m, 69.2 ± 3.6 yr) completed a 6-month weight loss program after randomization to three groups (n = 72 randomized; 15% dropout): 1) higher protein diet (PRO, ~30% energy from protein; n = 20), 2) PRO plus exercise (PRO + EX; n = 19), or 3) a conventional protein control diet plus EX (CON + EX, ~18% energy from protein; n = 22). EX was supervised, multicomponent (aerobic, muscle strengthening, balance, and flexibility), and three sessions per week. Body composition was measured via dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, leg strength by isokinetic dynamometry, and LEPF via 6-min walk, 8-ft up and go, and 30-s chair stand tests. Changes in weight (-7.5 ± 4.1 kg; -9.2% ± 4.8%), fat mass, and leg lean mass did not differ among groups (all P > 0.50). Despite weight loss, muscle strength improved in the exercise groups (PRO + EX and CON + EX) but it declined in the PRO group (P = 0.008). For all LEPF measures, the PRO group had attenuated improvements compared with both PRO + EX and CON + EX (all P < 0.01). Exercise during weight loss is critical to preserve strength and enhance LEPF; however, a higher protein diet does not appear to influence body composition, muscle strength, or LEPF changes when combined with multicomponent exercise.",

    "abstract": "Normal-weight obesity (NWO) syndrome is associated with metabolic diseases. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of 12 weeks of a high-protein (HP) v. a standard protein (SP) diet on appetite, anthropometry and body composition in NWO women. In this clinical trial, fifty NWO women were randomly allocated to HP (n 25) or SP (n 25) diet groups. Women in the HP and SP groups consumed 25 and 15 % of their total energy intake from protein for 12 weeks. Weight, fat mass (FM), lean body mass (LBM), waist circumference (WC) and appetite were evaluated at baseline and following their 3-month intervention. After 12 weeks, the LBM was higher in HP compared with no significant changes in the SP group (mean between-group difference = 1·5 kg; 95 % CI 3·1, 0·01; effect size (d) = 0·4). Furthermore, the HP group had lower FM (mean between-group difference -1·1 kg; 95 % CI 1, -3·3; d = -0·2), body fat percentage (BFP) (mean between-group difference -2 %; 95 % CI 0·7, -5·2; d = -0·3) and WC (mean between-group difference -1·4 cm; 95 % CI 0·6, -3·6; d = -0·2) at the end of the study in comparison with the SP group. In both groups, weight and appetite were unchanged over time without significant differences between groups. Twelve weeks of euenergetic diets with different dietary protein contents resulted in no significant weight loss in women with NWO. However, an HP diet significantly improved body composition (LBM, FM, BFP and WC) in this population.",

    "abstract": "Ileal transposition (IT) allows exploration of hindgut effects of bariatric procedures in inducing weight loss and reducing adiposity. Here we investigated the role of dietary macronutrient content on IT effects in rats. Male Lewis rats consuming one of three isocaloric liquid diets enriched with fat (HF), carbohydrates (HC), or protein (HP) underwent IT or sham surgery. Body weight, energy intake, energy efficiency, body composition, and (meal-induced) changes in plasma GIP, GLP-1, PYY, neurotensin, and insulin levels were measured. Following IT, HC intake remained highest leading to smallest weight loss among dietary groups. IT in HF rats caused high initial weight loss and profound hypophagia, but the rats caught up later, and finally had the highest body fat content among IT rats. HP diet most efficaciously supported IT-induced reduction in body weight and adiposity, but (as opposed to other diet groups) lean mass was also reduced. Energy efficiency decreased immediately after IT irrespective of diet, but normalized later. Energy intake alone explained variation in post-operative weight change by 80%. GLP-1, neurotensin, and PYY were upregulated by IT, particularly during (0-60 min) and following 17-h post-ingestive intake, with marginal diet effects. Thirty-day post-operative cumulative energy intake was negatively correlated to 17-h post-ingestive PYY levels, explaining 47% of its variation. Reduction in energy intake underlies IT-induced weight loss, with highest efficacy of the HP diet. PYY, GLP-1, and neurotensin levels are upregulated by IT, of which PYY may be most specifically related to reduced intake and weight loss after IT.",

    "abstract": "Nutritional status can affect the linear growth of bones during puberty by affecting growth plate (GP) chondrocytes. We hypothesized that there is a relationship between dietary patterns and bone age on girls who have experienced height loss. This cross-sectional study was conducted on 350 girls aged 12-13 years with open GP, and major dietary patterns were determined using the factor analysis method. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry measurement of participant's wrist was performed to determine GP openness and bone age. In the present study, 70.3% of participants had bone age below chronological age. Three major dietary patterns-healthy, high sugar and salt, and Western diet-were identified using findings of dietary intake. Adherence to the healthy diet led to significant increase in height, weight, body mass index, and other components of body composition such as lean body mass (P < .001). Among these dietary patterns, we found only a significant association between healthy diet and difference between bone and chronological age (B = -0.106). In the present study, adherence to a healthy diet was associated with increase in bone age (P = .02). Healthy dietary pattern with an emphasis on enough intake of plant protein and white meat was associated with better linear growth.",

    "title": "Detection and quantification of the anti-obesity drug celastrol in murine liver and brain.",
    "abstract": "Celastrol is a natural pentacyclic triterpene extracted from the roots of Tripterygium wilfordi (thunder god vine). Celastrol was reported as a powerful anti-obesity drug with leptin sensitizing properties that decreases food consumption and mediates body weight loss when administered to diet-induced obese mice at 100 μg/kg body weight. The weight lowering properties of celastrol are likely mediated by the CNS, in particular, by the hypothalamus, but the final proof for the accumulation of celastrol in the brain and hypothalamus remains to be established. Here, we aimed to demonstrate that intraperitoneal celastrol administration at 100 μg/kg can rapidly reach the brain and, in particular, the hypothalamus of mice. We developed and validated a sensitive liquid chromatography mass spectrometry method for the quantitative determination of celastrol in murine tissues, namely liver, brain and hypothalamus. Chow-fed lean mice were randomly assigned to the vehicle vs. celastrol groups, injected with saline or 100 μg/kg body weight of celastrol, and sacrificed 30 min or 120 min post injection. Celastrol was extracted from homogenized tissue using ethyl acetate as organic solvent, and quantified using a matrix-matched calibration curve with glycyrrhetinic acid as internal standard. Liver celastrol concentrations were 32.60 ± 8.21 pg/mg and 40.52 ± 15.6 pg/mg, 30 and 120 min after injection, respectively. We found 4.70 ± 0.31 pg/mg celastrol after 30 min, and 16.22 ± 3.33 pg/mg after 120 min in whole brain lysates, and detectable amounts in the hypothalamus. These results corroborate the validity of our methodology, demonstrate the accumulation of celastrol in the brain of mice injected intraperitoneally with a dose of 100 μg/kg, and confirm the CNS as possible site of action for the weight lowering properties of celastrol.",

Weight loss resulting from low-carbohydrate high-protein diets can be significant but has also been linked to potentially negative health effects due to increased bacterial fermentation of undigested protein within the colon and subsequent changes in gut microbiota composition. Correcting obesity-induced disruption of gut microbiota with synbiotics can be more effective than supplementation with probiotics alone because prebiotic components of synbiotics support the growth and survival of positive bacteria therein. The purpose of this placebo-controlled intervention clinical trial was to evaluate the effects of a synbiotic supplement on the composition, richness and diversity of gut microbiota and associations of microbial species with body composition parameters and biomarkers of obesity in human subjects participating in a weight loss program.

Accordingly, this study examined the effect of ADF combined with a low-carbohydrate diet on body weight and metabolic disease risk factors. Adults with obesity (n = 31) participated in ADF (600 kcal \"fast day\" alternated with an ad libitum \"feast day\") with a low-carbohydrate background diet (30% carbohydrates, 35% protein, and 35% fat). The 6-month trial consisted of a 3-month weight loss period followed by a 3-month weight maintenance period. Body weight decreased (-5.5 ± 0.5%;  These findings suggest that ADF combined with a low-carbohydrate diet is effective for weight loss, weight maintenance, and improving certain metabolic disease risk factors such as LDL cholesterol, blood pressure, and fasting insulin. While these preliminary findings are promising, they still require confirmation by a randomized control trial.",

    "abstract": "Whey protein (WH)-enriched diets are reported to aid in weight loss and to improve cardiovascular health. However, the bioactive components in whey responsible for causing such effects remain unidentified. We determined the effects of whey and its components [α-lactalbumin (LA) and lactoferrin (LF)] on energy balance, glucose tolerance, gut hormones, renal damage, and stroke onset in rats. Male spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone (SHRSP) rats (age 8 wk) were fed isocaloric high-fat (40% kcal) and high-salt (4% wt/wt) diets (n = 8-10/group) and randomized for 8 wk to diets enriched as follows: control (CO): 15% kcal from egg albumin, 45% kcal from carbohydrate; WH: 20%kcal WH isolate + 15% kcal egg albumin; LA: 20% kcal LA  + 15% kcal egg albumin; or LF: 20% kcal lactoferrin + 15% kcal egg albumin. Measurements included energy balance (food intake, energy expenditure, and body composition), stroke-related behaviors, brain imaging, glucose tolerance, metabolic hormones, and tissue markers of renal damage. Data were analyzed by linear mixed models with repeated measures or 1-way ANOVA. Diets enriched with WH, LA, or LF increased survival, with 25% of rats fed these diets exhibiting stroke-associated morbidity, whereas 90% of CO rats were morbid by 8 wk (P < 0.05). The nephritis scores of rats fed WH-, LA-, or LF-enriched diets were 80%, 92%, and 122% lower than those of COs (P = 0.001). The mRNA abundances of renin and osteopontin were 100-600% lower in rats fed WH-, LA-, or LF-enriched diets than in COs (P < 0.05). Urine albumin concentrations and albumin-to-creatinine ratios were 200% lower in rats fed LF-enriched diets than in COs (P < 0.05). Compared with COs, rats fed LF-enriched diets for 2-3 wk had food intake decreased by 29%, body weight decreased by 13-19%, lean mass decreased by 12-19%, and fat mass decreased by 20% (P < 0.001). Relative to COs, rats fed WH and LA had food intake decreased by 10% (P < 0.1), but COs had 12-45% lower weight than rats fed LA- and WH-enriched diets by 3 wk (P < 0.01). Compared with COs, rats fed WH-enriched diets increased energy expenditure by 7%, whereas, rats fed LA-enriched diets had energy expenditure acutely decreased by 7% during the first 4 d, and rats fed LF-enriched diets had energy expenditure decreased by 7-17% throughout the first week ( P < 0.001). Rats fed LA- and LF-enriched diets had blood glucose decreased by 14-19% (P < 0.05) and WH by 9% (P = 0.1), relative to COs. Compared with COs, rats fed LF had GIP decreased by 90% and PYY by 87% (P < 0.05). Together, these findings indicate that whey and its components α-lactalbumin and lactoferrin improved energy balance and glycemic control, and protected against the onset of neurological deficits associated with stroke and renal damage in male SHRSP rats.",

    "abstract": "The recognized benefits of a higher protein diet on muscle mass and strength in older adults are tempered by concerns of the potentially negative cardiometabolic impact of dietary sources of animal protein. The aim of this study was to explore the cardiometabolic impact of 2 weight reduction diets: a higher protein diet, providing balanced portions of lean beef and pork throughout the day, vs. a diet following the Recommended Daily Allowance level of protein in obese middle-aged and older adults. Data from Measuring Eating, Activity and Strength: Understanding the Response-Using Protein and Protein Optimization in Women Enables Results-Using Protein were combined for the present analysis. Subjects were randomly assigned to a 6-month weight loss diet (500 kcal deficit) and prescribed a Recommended Daily Allowance level of protein (0.8 g protein/kg BW), control group, or a higher level of protein (1.2 g protein/kg BW), protein group. For the protein group, lean, high-quality protein was evenly distributed between meals or balanced throughout the day (30 g protein/meal). The following cardiometabolic markers were quantified by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy: lipids, lipoproteins, GlycA, trimethylamine-N-oxide, betaine, branched-chain amino acids, and lipoprotein insulin resistance index scores. In both groups (control [n = 27] and protein [n = 53]), there were significant (P ≤ .05) changes from baseline in weight loss (-6.2% and -7.2%), distance walked (+53.1 and +75.0 meters), and fasting plasma glucose (-7.5 and -6.2 mg/dL), respectively. At endpoint, protein group had significantly (P ≤ .05) lower triglycerides (-17.3 mg/dL), large very-low-density lipoprotein particle concentration (VLDL-P; -1.2 nmol/L), total low-density lipoprotein particle concentration (LDL-P; -67.8 nmol/L), small LDL-P (-59.4 nmol/L) and lipoprotein insulin resistance index (-5.9), whereas control group had significantly (P ≤ .05) lower GlycA (-13.1 μmol/L), total VLDL-P (-7.9 nmol/L), and small VLDL-P (-7.0 nmol/L). Differences between groups were observed for small VLDL-P (P = .02) and protein intake (P < .0001). These findings suggest that a hypocaloric diet with either traditional (0.8 g/kg BW/d) or higher protein (1.2 g/kg BW/d; predominantly from lean red meat) content improves risk markers of cardiovascular disease and type II diabetes in obese middle-aged and older adults. Both diets were also associated with improved physical function, and neither had an adverse impact on cardiometabolic outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Gender influences obesity-related complications, including diabetes. Females are more protected from insulin resistance after diet-induced obesity, which may be related to fat accumulation and muscle insulin sensitivity. FoxOs regulate muscle atrophy and are targets of insulin action, but their role in muscle insulin sensitivity and mitochondrial metabolism is unknown. We measured muscle insulin signaling, mitochondrial energetics, and metabolic responses to a high-fat diet (HFD) in male and female muscle-specific FoxO1/3/4 triple knock-out (TKO) mice. In male TKO muscle, insulin-stimulated AKT activation was decreased. AKT2 protein and mRNA levels were reduced and insulin receptor protein and IRS-2 mRNA decreased. These changes contributed to decreased insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in glycolytic muscle in males. In contrast, female TKOs maintain normal insulin-mediated AKT phosphorylation, normal AKT2 levels, and normal glucose uptake in glycolytic muscle. When challenged with a HFD, fat gain was attenuated in both male and female TKO mice, and associated with decreased glucose levels, improved glucose homeostasis, and reduced muscle triglyceride accumulation. Furthermore, female TKO mice showed increased energy expenditure, relative to controls, due to increased lean mass and maintenance of mitochondrial function in muscle. FoxO deletion in muscle uncovers sexually dimorphic regulation of AKT2, which impairs insulin signaling in male mice, but not females. However, loss of FoxOs in muscle from both males and females also leads to muscle hypertrophy and increases in metabolic rate. These factors mitigate fat gain and attenuate metabolic abnormalities in response to a HFD.",

    "title": "Cyclic glycine-proline normalizes systolic blood pressure in high-fat diet-induced obese male rats.",
    "abstract": "Insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 deficiency is associated with a range of metabolic disorders. Cyclic glycine-proline (cGP) is a natural nutrient and regulates the amount of active IGF-1 in plasma. Plasma cGP decreases in hypertensive women whereas increases in obese women, suggesting its involvement in cardio-metabolic function. We therefore examined the effects of cGP on metabolic profiles and blood pressure in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese male rats. Male rats were fed either a HFD or a standard chow diet (STD) ad-libitum from 3 to 15 weeks of age. Rats were administered either saline or cGP from 11 to 15 weeks of age. At 14 weeks of age, systolic-blood pressure (SBP) was measured by tail-cuff plethysmography and body composition quantified by DEXA. Blood and retroperitoneal fat tissues were collected. Plasma concentrations of insulin, IGF-1, IGF binding protein (IGFBP)-3 and cGP were evaluated using ELISA and HPLC-MS respectively. Compared to STD, HFD feeding increased SBP, total fat mass and fat/lean ratio, retroperitoneal fat weight, fasting plasma insulin and cGP concentrations whereas decreased plasma IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 concentrations. Administration of cGP reduced SBP and retroperitoneal fat weight, but had no effect on body composition and plasma insulin concentrations. HFD-associated decreases in IGFBP-3 and increases in cGP represent an autocrine response to normalize IGF-1 function through improving the amount of bioavailable IGF-1 in the circulation of obese male rats. The beneficial effects of cGP on SBP and retroperitoneal fat mass may suggest a therapeutic potential for cGP in HFD-associated cardio-metabolic complications.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that polymorphism of genes with the biggest effects on body mass (FTO and PPARG) can affect the results of dieting in centrally obese postmenopausal women. A total of 144 volunteers were randomized to a 16-week intervention with two hypocaloric diets: either a Mediterranean diet (MED) moderate in fat (37% total energy as fat) or the Central European diet (CED) moderate in carbohydrates (55% total energy as carbohydrates). The associations between FTO and PPARG polymorphism on the baseline body mass, body composition, blood pressure, lipid and non-lipid parameters, and their changes after the trial were analyzed. None of the examined baseline outcomes differed in the rs9939609 FTO subgroups; abdominal fat was higher in the minor (G) allele carriers of the PPARG rs1801282. After the intervention, in the CED group, the PPARG G allele carriers showed greater reductions in weight (-6.58 ± 0.61 vs -9.58 ± 0.83; P < .01), lean mass (-0.38 ± 0.29 vs -1.79 ± 0.38; P < .05) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (-0.46 ± 0.77 vs -5.25 ± 1.49; P < .01) than the CC homozygotes, and the TT individuals of the rs9939609 FTO had greater reductions in diastolic blood pressure (-9.03 ± 1.78 vs. -7.58 ± 1.50; P < .05). In the MED group, greater reductions in abdominal fat were observed in the G allele carriers than in the CC homozygotes (-3.31 ± 0.26 vs. -4.23 ± 0.41; P < .05).

    "title": "Role of adipose tissue inflammation in fat pad loss induced by fasting in lean and mildly obese mice.",
    "abstract": "Inflammation induced by obesity contributes to insulin resistance and atherosclerosis. Indeed, high levels of proinflammatory cytokines trigger chronic low-grade inflammation and promote detrimental metabolic effects in the adipose tissue. On the other hand, inflammation seems to control fat pad expansion and to have important functions on lipolysis and glucose metabolism. Thus, it is possible that inflammation may also drive fat pad loss, as seen during long-fast periods. Herein, we have used fasting as a strategy to induce weight loss and evaluate the possible role of inflammation on adipose tissue remodeling. Male BALB-c mice were fed with chow diet (lean mice) or with high-carbohydrate refined diet (mildly obese mice) for 8 weeks. After that, animals were subjected to 24 h of fasting. There was a 63% reduction of adiposity in lean mice following fasting. Furthermore, the adipose tissue was enriched of immune cells and had a higher content of IL-6, TNF-alpha, IL-10, TGF-β and CXCL-1. Interestingly, mildly obese mice, subjected to the same 24-h fasting period, lost only 33% of their adiposity. Following fasting, these mice did not show any increment in leukocyte recruitment and cytokine levels, as did lean mice. Our findings indicate that inflammation participates in fat mass loss induced by fasting. Although the chronic low-grade inflammation seen in obesity is associated with metabolic diseases, a lower inflammatory response triggered by fasting in mildly obese mice impairs fat pad mobilization.",

This study aims to: i) assess the prevalence of patients with low HGS; and ii) verify if HGS is correlated with high protein diet and leucine consumption in hemodialysis patients. This cross-sectional study analysed patients at two center hemodialysis (HD) clinic and sixty-two patients aged ∼39 years with length of time on HD ∼60 months undergoing HD was carried out.

In addition, no correlation was found between protein intake (if in percentage or g/kg/d) and HGS (r = 0.07, p = 0.58; r = -0.04, p = 0.70, respectively). Although there is a low correlation among leucine intake (g/d) and HGS (r = 0.39, p = 0.01), low HGS was not associated with leucine intake in the crude model (OR: 0.86 95%CI(0.60-1.24) p = 0.441), nor after adjustment for age, sex and BMI (OR: 0.84 95%CI(0.56-1.26), p = 0.422).

    "abstract": "This study compared the effects of alternate-day fasting (ADF) with those of daily calorie restriction (CR) on body weight and glucoregulatory factors in adults with overweight or obesity and insulin resistance. This secondary analysis examined the data of insulin-resistant individuals (n = 43) who participated in a 12-month study that compared ADF (25% energy needs on \"fast days\"; 125% energy needs on alternating \"feast days\") with CR (75% energy needs every day) and a control group regimen. In insulin-resistant participants, weight loss was not different between ADF (-8% ± 2%) and CR (-6% ± 1%) by month 12, relative to controls (P < 0.0001). Fat mass and BMI decreased (P < 0.05) similarly from ADF and CR. ADF produced greater decreases (P < 0.05) in fasting insulin (-52% ± 9%) and insulin resistance (-53% ± 9%) compared with CR (-14% ± 9%; -17% ± 11%) and the control regimen by month 12. Lean mass, visceral fat mass, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, blood pressure, C-reactive protein, tumor necrosis factor α, and interleukin 6 values remained unchanged. These findings suggest that ADF may produce greater reductions in fasting insulin and insulin resistance compared with CR in insulin-resistant participants despite similar decreases in body weight.",

We aimed to investigate the short-term and long-term effects of calorie restriction with adequate nutrition on these risk factors in healthy, lean, or slightly overweight young and middle-aged individuals. CALERIE was a phase 2, multicentre, randomised controlled trial in young and middle-aged (21-50 years), healthy non-obese (BMI 22·0-27·9 kg/m From May 8, 2007, to Feb 26, 2010, of 238 participants that were assessed, 218 were randomly assigned to and started a 25% calorie restriction diet (n=143, 66%) or an ad libitum control diet (n=75, 34%). Individuals in the calorie restriction group achieved a mean reduction in calorie intake of 11·9% (SE 0·7; from 2467 kcal to 2170 kcal) versus 0·8% (1·0) in the control group, and a sustained mean weight reduction of 7·5 kg (SE 0·4) versus an increase of 0·1 kg (0·5) in the control group, of which 71% (mean change in fat mass 5·3 kg [SE 0·3] divided by mean change in weight 7·5 kg [0·4]) was fat mass loss. Calorie restriction caused a persistent and significant reduction from baseline to 2 years of all measured conventional cardiometabolic risk factors, including change scores for LDL-cholesterol (p<0·0001), total cholesterol to HDL-cholesterol ratio (p<0·0001), and systolic (p<0·0011) and diastolic (p<0·0001) blood pressure. In addition, calorie restriction resulted in a significant improvement at 2 years in C-reactive protein (p=0·012), insulin sensitivity index (p<0·0001), and metabolic syndrome score (p<0·0001) relative to control. A sensitivity analysis revealed the responses to be robust after controlling for relative weight loss changes. 2 years of moderate calorie restriction significantly reduced multiple cardiometabolic risk factors in young, non-obese adults. These findings suggest the potential for a substantial advantage for cardiovascular health of practicing moderate calorie restriction in young and middle-aged healthy individuals, and they offer promise for pronounced long-term population health benefits.

    "abstract": "To explore the changes in FSP27 expression and fat metabolism in adipose tissue and their relationship after bariatric surgery in rats. Food intake, body weight, triglyceride content, fat distribution, and fat cell morphology were evaluated in rats grouped into control, sham, sleeve gastrectomy (SG), and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) groups. Immunohistochemistry and western blotting were used to detect protein expression and real-time PCR was used to detect mRNA expression. Mouse 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were used to assess the effects of different energy levels and nutrient factors on FSP27 in adipocytes. Food intake, body weight, and triglyceride levels were reduced in RYGB and SG rats within 28 days after surgery, with a more pronounced effect in the RYGB group. Weight loss was mainly due to loss of fat mass rather than loss of lean mass, with the most pronounced decrease in trunk fat. FSP27 expression increased in lean rat adipocytes accompanied by increased lipid droplets (LDs). In SG and RYGB rats, the FSP27 protein concentration gradually increased in white adipose tissue (WAT) after operation. Hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), p-HSL/HSL, Adipose Triglyceride Lipase (ATGL), and Comparative Gene Identification-58 (CGI-58) gradually decreased in SG and RYGB rats, but they were always higher than in control and sham animals. FSP27 was also decreased in 3T3-L1 adipocytes of animals with a high-energy diet. FSP27 is associated with rat lipid metabolism and its expression varies with energy and nutrient supply. It can inhibit excessive hydrolysis and fat accumulation by regulating HSL and ATGL expression and by mediating LDs formation.",

In the MEASUR-UP trial, we evaluated changes in baseline levels of inflammatory markers with post-study levels for a traditional weight loss control group versus a group with generous, balanced protein intake.

    "title": "EXPRESS: Effect of Monotherapeutic Caloric Restriction Diet on Cardiometabolic Parameters in Adults with Overweight or Obesity: Insights from Meta-Analyses of Randomized Controlled Trials.",
    "abstract": "The cardiometabolic benefits of caloric restriction (CR) often overlap with those of intermittent fasting (IF), creating clinical uncertainty. This meta-analysis updates and refines the evidence on the effects of a monotherapeutic CR diet (MCRD) on cardiometabolic parameters in adults at high cardiovascular risk, compared with a usual diet. A systematic search of four databases through May 2025 identified 17 randomized controlled trials (1,066 participants) with low to moderate risk of bias, all involving populations with a mean baseline BMI ≥30 kg/m². The results indicate that MCRD significantly reduced body weight (MD: -6.29 kg; 95% CI: -7.51, -5.06), waist circumference (MD: -5.09 cm; 95% CI: -6.48, -3.70), body fat (MD: -4.89 kg; 95% CI: -5.92, -3.87), central abdominal fat (MD: -0.7 kg; 95% CI: -0.97, -0.43), and lean body mass (MD: -1.34 kg; 95% CI: -2.14, -0.53). Significant metabolic improvements were observed, with reductions in fasting insulin (MD: -2.22 μIU/L; 95% CI: -3.83 to -0.61), HbA1c (MD: -0.31%; 95% CI: -0.61 to -0.01), HOMA-IR (MD: -0.97; 95% CI: -1.86 to -0.09), and both systolic (MD: -6.06 mmHg; 95% CI: -9.46 to -2.65) and diastolic blood pressure (MD: -3.79 mmHg; 95% CI: -6.34 to -1.25). No significant effects were observed on lipid profiles, glucose levels, or hs-CRP. Meta-regression showed that caloric intake reduction, longer intervention duration, and older age significantly covariate on weight reduction. While beneficial, MCRD requires complementary strategies for optimal health. Further research is needed to clarify its unique mechanisms and distinguish them from the overlapping effects of IF.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is associated with several cardiovascular risk factors, including obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) development and poorer sleep quality. While diet-induced weight reduction can improve sleep quality, traditional dietary strategies may be challenging and restrictive to maintain. Intermittent fasting (IF) diets offer an alternative, less prescriptive intervention to improve cardiometabolic health markers, though their specific effects on sleep quality are unclear. This systematic review and meta-analysis assessed the effects of IF on sleep and cardiometabolic outcomes associated with OSA risk among adults with overweight/obesity. Eighteen randomized controlled trials (25 comparisons) that compared IF (n = 15 time-restricted eating (TRE); n = 3 alternate-day modified fasting (ADMF)), vs ad libitum eating were identified. Compared to ad libitum eating, TRE and ADMF interventions produced greater reductions in weight, BMI, fat mass, waist circumference, daily energy intake, and diastolic blood pressure. Sleep quality was assessed as a secondary outcome in 15/16 studies. No overall effects of IF on sleep relative to ad libitum eating were observed, despite improvements in weight. This analysis supports IF interventions as an alternative to continuous energy restriction for improving cardiometabolic health in populations with obesity and sleep disturbances, such as OSA. Studies are needed to specifically evaluate the effects of IF on sleep.",

    "abstract": "Obesity has emerged as a global health crisis, posing significant challenges to metabolic function and cognitive health. It is associated with insulin resistance, elevated triglycerides, and reduced HDL cholesterol levels. Cognitive decline in obesity involves multifactorial pathways including neuroinflammation, vascular dysfunction, and blood-brain barrier disruption. Intermittent Hypoxia Training (IHT) and Intermittent Fasting (IF) have shown promise as non-pharmacological interventions for these obesity-related issues. This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to evaluate the effects of IHT, IF, and their combination on metabolic markers (insulin sensitivity, lipid profiles, glucose levels) and specific cognitive domains (memory, executive function, attention) and cognitive function in obese adults. The analysis encompassed studies published from October 2014 onward, sourced from PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and other relevant databases. The inclusion criteria were randomized controlled trials and non-randomized comparative studies focusing on IHT, IF, or their combination. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and the Cochrane risk bias tool. Data synthesis was performed using a random-effects model, with heterogeneity assessed via  The review included 28 studies involving 2,134 participants, followed up for an average of 12 weeks. Among these, 15 were RCTs and 13 were observational studies. The participants had a mean age of 45 ± 12 years, with 60% being female. The combined IHT and IF intervention demonstrated superior benefits, with significant weight loss (mean reduction: 6.3 kg, 95% CI: -8.2 to -4.5 kg). Cognitive performance showed domain-specific improvements: memory (SMD = 0.60, 95% CI: 0.43-0.77) and attention (SMD = 0.57, 95% CI: 0.40-0.74), though with significant heterogeneity ( Our meta-analysis reveals that IHT and IF may serve as promising non-drug strategies for improving metabolic and cognitive outcomes in adults with obesity. Given the short-term evidence and methodological heterogeneity, long-term studies are needed to confirm these findings.",

    "abstract": "Overweight and obesity have become significant public health concerns. Three types of intermittent fasting (IF)-alternate-day fasting (ADF), time-restricted eating (TRE), and the 5:2 diet-have shown potential for weight loss. However, the effects of IF on sleep remain unclear. Multiple databases were searched in January 2025. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in adults with overweight and obese that compared the effects of IF, continuous energy restriction (CER), and usual diet (UD) on sleep-related outcomes were eligible. The primary outcome was the global Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and secondary outcomes included PSQI components, the Epworth sleepiness scale, and other subjective and objective sleep parameters. A Bayesian network meta-analysis was performed. Sixteen trials were included. There were no significant differences in PSQI components among ADF, CER, TRE, the 5:2 diet, and the UD. ADF had a higher sleep latency score than CER and the UD (MD = 1.04, 95 % CI: 0.15-1.93; MD = 1.39, 95 % CI: 0.37-2.60, respectively). TRE had a longer time in bed than UD (MD = 26.04, 95 % CI: 3.36-48.73), and a longer sleep onset latency than CER (MD = 9.54, 95 % CI: 3.43-15.68). No differences were found for most other sleep parameters. ADF and TRE were shown to have slight effects on some sleep parameters. However, due to limitations, such as small sample sizes and varying protocols of the included studies, the results should be interpreted cautiously.

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major global health concern associated with modifiable risk factors including obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and hyperglycemia. While various dietary patterns have demonstrated cardiovascular benefits, their comparative effectiveness remains unclear. This network meta-analysis (NMA) systematically evaluates the impact of eight dietary patterns on cardiovascular risk markers. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing low-fat, Mediterranean, ketogenic, low-carbohydrate, high-protein, vegetarian, intermittent fasting, and DASH diets. A random-effects model analyzed mean differences (MD) in body composition (weight, BMI, waist circumference), lipid profiles (triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL-C, LDL-C), glycemic markers (glucose), and blood pressure (systolic/diastolic). Dietary efficacy was ranked via Surface Under the Cumulative Ranking Curve (SUCRA) scores. Among 21 RCTs (1,663 participants), ketogenic (MD -10.5 kg, 95% CI -18.0 to -3.05; SUCRA 99) and high-protein diets (MD -4.49 kg, 95% CI -9.55 to 0.35; SUCRA 71) showed superior efficacy for weight reduction. For waist circumference, ketogenic (MD -11.0 cm, 95% CI -17.5 to -4.54; SUCRA 100) and low-carbohydrate diets (MD -5.13 cm, 95% CI -8.83 to -1.44; SUCRA 77) achieved greatest reductions. DASH diet most effectively lowered systolic blood pressure (MD -7.81 mmHg, 95% CI -14.2 to -0.46; SUCRA 89), while intermittent fasting also demonstrated significant blood pressure-lowering effects (MD -5.98 mmHg, 95% CI -10.4 to -0.35; SUCRA 76). Low-carbohydrate (MD 4.26 mg/dL, 95% CI 2.46-6.49; SUCRA 98) and low-fat diets (MD 2.35 mg/dL, 95% CI 0.21-4.40; SUCRA 78) optimally increased HDL-C. Diet-specific cardioprotective effects were observed: ketogenic and high-protein diets excel in weight management, DASH and intermittent fasting in blood pressure control, and carbohydrate-restricted diets in lipid modulation. These findings support personalized dietary strategies for targeted CVD risk factor management.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is a global health crisis, projected to affect over 1.53 billion adults by 2035. Intermittent fasting (IF) has emerged as a potential alternative to continuous energy restriction (CER) for weight management and metabolic improvement. However, previous meta-analyses have reported inconsistent results. These knowledge gaps hinder the clinical translation of IF, and a rigorous synthesis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) is necessary to clarify their effects on body composition and cardiometabolic health in overweight and obese populations. This PRISMA-guided systematic review and meta-analysis searched PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science up to March 2025. We included 15 randomized controlled trials (n = 758) comparing IF diets with control diets in overweight/obese adults. Primary outcome indicators included total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), body weight (BW), body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR). Data were pooled using a random-effects model and analyzed in subgroups by intervention duration and IF form. IF significantly reduced BW (MD: -3.73 kg, 95% CI: -5.29, -2.17) and BMI (MD: -1.04 kg/m², 95% CI: -1.39, -0.70) in overweight/obese adults, while effectively improving lipid profiles, including TC (MD: -6.31 mg/dl, 95% CI: -12.36, -0.26) and LDL (MD: -5.44 mg/dl, 95% CI: -12.36, -0.26). However, short-term IF (≤ 12 weeks) may have resulted in a temporary elevation of TG (MD: 13.22 mg/dl, 95% CI: 3.39, 23.05), whereas long-term intervention (> 12 weeks) optimized lipid metabolism benefits. In addition, IF significantly reduced DBP (MD: -3.30 mmHg, 95% CI: -5.47, -1.13) but had no significant effect on SBP, FPG and HbA1c. Subgroup analyses showed that alternate day fasting (ADF) was superior to time-restricted eating (TRE) in terms of weight loss and improvement in LDL. The findings suggest that the metabolic effects of IF are time-dependent, and that its clinical use needs to be combined with individualized regimens and long-term adherence strategies. Limitations include the short intervention period (≤ 12 weeks) and high heterogeneity of most studies, and standardized long-term trials are needed to validate the sustained benefits and safety. As a non-pharmacological intervention, IF demonstrates significant value for weight management and metabolic improvement. Its advantages in adherence and metabolic regulation position it as a promising therapeutic approach. However, its long-term efficacy and safety warrant further validation through additional high-quality clinical studies. Future efforts should focus on developing precise, sustainable, and personalized IF protocols within a personalized medicine framework to achieve comprehensive cardiometabolic health optimization.

    "title": "Effectiveness and safety of intermittent fasting on blood pressure in adults with overweight or obesity: a systematic review.",
    "abstract": "Previous intermittent fasting (IF) studies have reported inconsistent findings regarding its antihypertensive effects and safety. This study aimed to assess the effects and safety of IF on blood pressure (BP), anthropometrics, and cardiometabolic risk markers in individuals with overweight or obesity compared to a no-intervention control group. Relevant studies were retrieved from multiple databases, including CNKI, Wanfang, VIP, SinoMed, PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science, up to April 30, 2024. A meta-analysis was performed using Stata version 18.0 and RevMan 5.4, calculating mean differences (MD) or risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) via the Knapp-Hartung modified random-effects model. Publication bias was evaluated using a contour-enhanced funnel plot and Egger's test. Fifteen studies (n = 929) were included. IF significantly reduced systolic blood pressure (SBP) (MD = -4.43 mmHg, 95% CI: -5.83 to -3.03, p < 0.001) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (MD = -2.00 mmHg, 95% CI: -3.23 to -0.78, p < 0.001) compared to control. IF also improved anthropometric measures, Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR), and Triglycerides (TG). Seven studies reported minor adverse effects. Although the IF group showed a higher risk of vomiting (RR = 1.11, 95% CI: 1.04-1.19, p = 0.01) and irritability (RR = 1.22, 95% CI: 1.13-1.31, p < 0.001) compared to the control group, these reactions were predominantly observed during the initial phase of the intervention and were self-resolving. IF significantly lowered SBP and DBP in individuals with overweight or obesity, particularly in high-risk subgroups (obesity, age ≥45 years, and prehypertension/hypertension), with a favorable safety profile. Due to heterogeneity, future trials should standardize IF regimens and target these subgroups to confirm generalizability. The review protocol has been registered on PROSPERO (CRD42024540777).",

Relevant studies were identified through a systematic search across five databases. A random-effects meta-analysis was conducted on outcomes including body composition and cardiometabolic health markers, to compare the effect of combining IF with exercise against IF alone. The certainty of the evidence was evaluated using the GRADE approach, while the quality of the included studies was assessed using the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool and the TESTEX scale. In total, twelve studies including 616 participants (Age: 40 ± 9 years; BMI: 33.6 ± 4.8 kg/m The potential benefits of incorporating exercise into IF for adults with overweight/obesity, particularly in terms of body composition, glycemic control, and cardiorespiratory fitness, appear promising.

Systematic review and network meta-analysis. Medline, Embase, and central databases from inception to 14 November 2024. Randomised clinical trials comparing the association of intermittent fasting diets (alternate day fasting, time restricted eating, and whole day fasting), continuous energy restriction, and ad-libitum diets were included. Outcomes included body weight (primary) and measures of anthropometry, glucose metabolism, lipid profiles, blood pressure, C-reactive protein, and markers of liver disease. A network meta-analysis based on a frequentist framework was performed with data expressed as mean difference with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The certainty of the evidence was assessed using grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE). 99 randomised clinical trials involving 6582 adults of varying health conditions (720 healthy, 5862 existing health conditions) were identified. All intermittent fasting and continuous energy restriction diet strategies reduced body weight when compared with ad-libitum diet. Compared with continuous energy restriction, alternate day fasting was the only form of intermittent fasting diet strategy to show benefit in body weight reduction (mean difference -1.29 kg (95% CI -1.99 to -0.59), moderate certainty of evidence). Additionally, alternate day fasting showed a trivial reduction in body weight compared with both time restricted eating and whole day fasting (mean difference -1.69 kg (-2.49 to -0.88) and -1.05 kg (-1.90 to -0.19), respectively, both with moderate certainty of evidence). Estimates were similar among trials with less than 24 weeks follow-up (n=76); however, moderate-to-long-term trials (≥24 weeks, n=17) only showed benefits in weight reduction in diet strategies compared with ad-libitum. Furthermore, in comparisons between intermittent fasting strategies, alternate day fasting lowered total cholesterol, triglycerides, and non-high density lipoprotein compared with time restricted eating. Compared with whole day fasting, however, time restricted eating resulted in a small increase in total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, and non-high density lipoprotein cholesterol. No differences were noted between intermittent fasting, continuous energy restriction, and ad-libitum diets for HbA Minor differences were noted between some intermittent fasting diets and continuous energy restriction, with some benefit of weight loss with alternate day fasting in shorter duration trials. The current evidence provides some indication that intermittent fasting diets have similar benefits to continuous energy restriction for weight loss and cardiometabolic risk factors. Longer duration trials are needed to further substantiate these findings. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05309057.",

    "abstract": "Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) like hypertension, type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and obesity, are a leading cause of mortality and have shown rising prevalence trends over the last few decades. Lifestyle interventions, particularly diet and physical activity, are an effective approach to addressing the underlying risk factors of these preventable NCDs, but their integration into the primary care practice remains underutilized. This review synthesizes evidence from systematic reviews and meta-analyses published between 2019 and 2024 to provide evidence-based recommendations for the integration of lifestyle interventions into primary care pathways. The included articles were noted for their risk of bias because of poor study design. While consideration must be given to the quality of evidence for these interventions because of the risk of bias, there is good evidence to support the use of several types of interventions including: diet modification (e.g. food replacement, calorie restriction, intermittent/periodic fasting); diet education and counselling; individual and group-based exercise interventions; interventions that aim to promote general physical activity in daily life; as well as combined dietary and physical activity interventions delivered individually, in groups, at a community level as well as through smartphone-supported applications. It is important for the health and care community to explore and implement alternative means of generating evidence, integrating lifestyle interventions into care pathways and increasing investment in the lifecycle of these interventions, which can promote health and prevent disease.",

    "title": "Effect of intermittent fasting on obesity and metabolic indices in patients with metabolic syndrome: a systematic review and meta analysis.",
    "abstract": "Dietary patterns play a vital role in the health management of individuals with metabolic syndrome. Many recent studies have shown that intermittent fasting (IF) has better effects, such as improving obesity. Nevertheless, it warrants further investigation to determine which approach is more effective in comparison to continuous energy restriction (CR), particularly when total calorie intake shows minimal variation. Consequently, it is crucial to evaluate the degree of enhancement of the two dietary patterns concerning different aspects of metabolic syndrome. This study presents a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) aimed at comparing the impacts of IF and CR on obesity and glucolipid metabolism in individuals diagnosed with metabolic syndrome. In August 2024, a thorough examination of English-language literature was performed across the PubMed, Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases. The meta-analyses was performed according to the established guidelines and reported the results. Weight change, Body Mass Index (BMI) change, and triglyceride (TG) level change were designated as key assessment indicators, while blood pressure, blood glucose, hip circumference, and waist circumference served as supplementary indicators for comparative analysis. A total of nine studies involving 626 patients were analyzed, focusing on the influence of dietary patterns on obesity, cholesterol levels, and insulin resistance among individuals diagnosed with metabolic syndrome. Both dietary patterns were beneficial for patients with metabolic syndrome. However, IF was better than CRin terms of improvement in obesity over the trial period (mean -1.77, 95% CI [-3.06, -0.48]), and it was more conducive to a reduction in TG levels, which was beneficial in terms of improving insulin resistance (mean -10.16, 95% CI [-18.88, -1.45]). Given its notable advantages for obesity, lipids, and insulin resistance, along with improved patient adherence, IF may be regarded as a more effective dietary approach for individuals with metabolic syndrome. Nonetheless, the long-term effectiveness still necessitates additional validation. CRD42024587335.",

    "abstract": "Continuous energy restriction (CER) and intermittent fasting (IF) are both prevalent diet regimens recommended for weight loss and metabolic improvement. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of CER and IF on weight loss and metabolic improvement in adults with overweight, obesity, or metabolic abnormalities. PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library (CENTRAL) were searched for randomized controlled trials of 3 degrees of CER diet regimens and 4 categories of IF diet regimens, from inception of the databases to December 2022. Two reviewers independently extracted demographic information, the intervention duration, details of the dietary interventions, and data on the outcomes of interest. Bayesian random-effect network meta-analyses were used to pool the results and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework was used to assess the certainty of the evidence and to present the findings. The study included 167 eligible trials with a total enrollment of 11 998 participants. Most IF diet regimens induced significant weight loss that was comparable with that induced by CER diet regimens with a similar absolute energy restriction, based on low- to high-certainty evidence. Severe CER proved to be the most effective regimen for obtaining weight loss, based on moderate-certainty evidence (mean difference of weight change 11.50 kg [95% CI 10.07 to 12.93]), followed by alternate-day fasting, based on high-certainty evidence (mean difference of weight change (5.07 kg [95% CI 3.44 to 6.72]) and moderate CER, based on moderate-certainty evidence (6.09 kg [95% CI 5.26 to 6.93]), when the regimens being compared were consistent in their absolute energy restriction extent. Similar results were noticed for body measurements, blood pressure, blood lipids, and glycemic profiles. In the subgroup analysis, the weight-loss effects of the IF but not the CER diet regimens experienced rebound after 12 weeks. In adults with overweight, obesity, or metabolic abnormalities, effectiveness in weight loss mainly depends on the extent of the energy restriction, regardless of the mealtime patterns.

    "abstract": "Time-Restricted Eating (TRE) is an intermittent fasting approach that holds promise in managing obesity and appears to influence hunger. We hypothesized that the effects of TRE would be due to a lower caloric intake imposed, as with any other type of dietary intervention. However, it remains unclear whether these effects are attributed to the chrononutrition protocol itself or the caloric restriction resulting from the intervention. Our primary aim was to examine the impact of TRE on hunger compared to isocaloric strategies in adults with overweight or obesity. We conducted a systematic review of randomized clinical trials, with inclusion criteria comprising adults aged 18 years and older with overweight/obesity. A literature search was conducted from the earliest available article up to January 2025, with no restrictions on time, region, or language. The search encompassed major electronic databases, including CENTRAL, MEDLINE, LILACS, EMBASE, Google Scholar, and OpenGrey. Of the 14 studies included, four met the eligibility criteria for the primary meta-analysis, which evaluated hunger in 323 participants. The findings revealed that TRE resulted in an increase in hunger (MD 2.05, 95% CI 1.46, 2.64; I² = 0%) compared to the isocaloric control group. In conclusion, the TRE protocol was associated with elevated hunger compared to isocaloric strategies, which may warrant further investigation into its long-term feasibility in weight loss programs.",

    "abstract": "A current investigation was performed to review and summarize the results of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) studies that have assessed the effectiveness of fasting regimens (FRs) including intermittent fasting (IF), time-restricted feeding (TRF), alternate day fasting (ADF) and fasting-mimicking diet (FMD) on some weight regulation hormones included; leptin, adiponectin, ghrelin, and resistin in healthy, overweight and obese adults recently. Four databases have been reviewed until June 2024 using keywords related to the subject of the study. Overall, 16 documents were considered in this study. Based on Pooled effect sizes, the FRs marginal significantly increased the level of adiponectin (weighted mean differences (WMD): 0.41 µg/ml, 95% confidence interval (CI): - 0.07 to 0.89, P: 0.09) and also significantly decreased the level of leptin (WMD: - 2.65 ng/ml, 95% CI: - 3.86 to - 1.44, p < 0.001) and ghrelin (WMD: - 0.57 ng/ml, 95% CI: - 1.01 to - 0.03, P: 0.01). There was no significant effect of this regimen approach on resistin levels. In general, according to this evaluation, FRs have a beneficial impact on weight-regulating hormone levels, still the long-term effects of these dietary approaches should also be evaluated in future studies.",

    "abstract": "This umbrella review comprehensively and systematically summarizes meta-analyses on the impact of dawn-to-dusk, dry intermittent fasting of Ramadan (RIF) on cardiometabolic and glucose homeostasis indicators. Twenty meta-analyses were examined on the effects of RIF on body fat percentage (BFP), fat mass, fat-free mass, body mass index (BMI), body weight (BW), waist circumference (WC), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), and very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C), fasting blood glucose (FBG), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), serum insulin, leptin, and adiponectin. Results of continuous outcomes were pooled from included meta-analyses. We employed random-effects meta-analysis using the restricted maximum likelihood method to estimate heterogeneity. P-values were derived from standard meta-analytic tests, including Egger's test for small-study effects and the excess significance test for potential publication bias. Additionally, we applied criteria from Ioannidis' evidence classification to assess the credibility of the findings. In healthy subjects, RIF was associated with significant reductions in BW (Hedges' G = -0.33; 95 % confidence interval (CI) = -0.37, -0.29; p-value = 2.63 × 10-52), WC (Hedges' G = -0.30; 95 % CI = -0.38, -0.23; p-value = 5.73 × 10-15), BFP (Hedges' G = -0.26; 95 % CI = -0.37, -0.14; p-value = 6.81 × 10-06), DBP (n = 3,456; Hedges' G = -0.26; 95 % CI = -0.38, -0.15; p-value = 9.18 × 10-06), TC (n = 9,314; Hedges' G = -0.16; 95 % CI = -0.25, -0.07; p-value = 6.27 × 10-04), and TG levels (n = 9,020; Hedges' G = -0.16; 95 % CI = -0.24, -0.08; p-value = 6.87 × 10-05). Moreover, in general population, TG (n = 16,688; Hedges' G = -0.15; 95 % CI = -0.22, -0.08; p-value <0.01) and FBG (n = 16,106; Hedges' G = -0.23; 95 % CI = -0.33, -0.13; p-value <0.01) were significantly reduced. Dawn-to-dusk, dry RIF shows promise as a complementary therapy and preventive measure for reducing cardiometabolic and obesity-related risks. However, controlled studies are necessary to validate its effectiveness and fully understand its health implications.",

Fifteen studies, including 338 participants, that evaluated TRE vs. unrestricted eating in individuals performing exercise were analyzed. A random-effects model was used to calculate the weighted mean effect sizes (ES) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI's). According to the pooled results, TRE had a small but significant reduction of fat mass (FM) kg with an effect size of -0.20 (95% CI = -0.28 to -0.13, p < 0.001) and on body fat percent (BF%) with an effect size of -0.23 (95% CI = -0.35 to -0.11, p < 0.001). The prediction interval ranged from -0.48 to 0.08 for FM and from -0.64 to 0.18 for BF%, respectively. TRE did not significantly alter fat-free mass (FFM) kg compared to control (p = 0.07). Furthermore, age, body mass index (BMI), exercise type, study duration, and energy intake did not have a significant impact on the variation in effect sizes according to the subgroup analyses (p > 0.05). TRE with exercise may reduce fat mass compared to an unrestricted eating window exercise-matched control while preserving FFM. However, more studies are needed.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to assess the comparative effectiveness of massage combined with lifestyle intervention and lifestyle intervention alone in patients with simple obesity. The PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, CNKI, VIP Database, and Wanfang Data were searched. Meta-analysis was conducted in accordance with the 2020 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines. Primary outcomes were body weight (BW) and body mass index (BMI). Secondary outcomes were waist circumference (WC), hip circumference (HC), total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), fasting insulin (FINS), and homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and adverse events. Thirteen randomized controlled trials were included. The meta-analysis showed that massage combined with lifestyle intervention significantly decreased BW (mean difference [MD]: -4.85; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -8.25 to -1.46; P = .005), BMI (MD: -2.65; 95% CI: -4.05 to -1.24; P = .0002), WC (MD: -3.63; 95% CI: -6.28 to -0.98; P = .007), TC (MD: -0.52; 95% CI: -0.84 to -0.20; P = .001), TG (MD: -0.23; 95% CI: -0.45 to -0.02; P = .003), LDL-C (MD: -0.48; 95% CI: -0.54 to -0.42; P < .00001), HDL-C (MD: -0.11; 95% CI: -0.17 to -0.05; P = .0004), FINS (MD: -1.64; 95% CI: -3.16 to -0.12; P = .03), and HOMA-IR (MD: -0.42; 95% CI: -0.65 to -0.18; P = .0005) compared with lifestyle intervention alone. In subgroup analyses, more obvious reduction in BMI (P = .02, I2 = 80.3%) for the children and adolescents subgroup, more obvious reduction in HC (P = .04, I2 = 76.1%) for the adults subgroup, more significant reduction in TC (P < .00001, I2 = 98.3%), LDL-C (P < .00001, I2 = 95.6%), and HDL-C (P < .0001, I2 = 94.1%) for intermittent treatment subgroup and more significant reduction in TC (P < .00001, I2 = 95.9%) and HDL-C (P < .0001, I2 = 94.1%) for treatment times ≤30 subgroup were detected. Compared with lifestyle intervention alone, massage combined with lifestyle intervention significantly decreased BW, BMI, WC, TC, TG, LDL-C, FINS, and HOMA-IR, but produced less effect in increasing HDL-C. And different ages, treatment intervals, and treatment times can all affect treatment outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Intermittent fasting (IF) can be an effective dietary therapy for weight loss and improving cardiometabolic health. However, there is scant evidence regarding the role of IF on indicators of liver function, particularly in adults with metabolic disorders. Therefore, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the effects of IF on liver function in adults with metabolic disorders. Three primary electronic databases including PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus, were searched from inception to September 2024 to identify original studies that used IF interventions with or without control groups in adults with metabolic disorders. Inclusion criteria were (1) studies of human participants with metabolic diseases, (2) interventions that evaluated the effects of IF, (3) with or without a control group, and (4) measured liver fat, liver steatosis, liver fibrosis, or liver enzymes, including alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) as primary outcomes. Standardized mean differences (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using random effects models. Heterogeneity was assessed using the Cochran's Q statistic and I-squared statistic (I A total 21 studies involving 1,226 participants with metabolic disorders were included in the meta-analysis. Overall, IF effectively decreased liver fat with a large effect size [SMD: -1.22 (95% CI: -1.63 to -0.80), p = 0.001], liver steatosis with a medium effect size [SMD: -0.73 (95% CI: -1.12 to -0.35), p = 0.001], ALT with a small effect size [SMD: -0.44 (95% CI: -0.58 to -0.30), p = 0.001], and AST with a small effect size [SMD: -0.30 (95% CI: -0.49 to -0.11), p = 0.001], but not liver fibrosis [SMD: -0.28 (95% CI: -0.59 to 0.02), p = 0.07]. Subgroup analyses showed that IF decreased liver fat and ALT significantly, independent of IF mode, participant age, health status, weight status, and intervention duration. IF significantly decreased liver fibrosis in those with obesity; and decreased AST following 5:2 diets, in middle-aged adults, adults with obesity, and regardless of health status or intervention duration. IF seems to be an effective dietary therapy for improving liver function in adults with metabolic disorders, and many of liver function-related benefits occur regardless of IF mode, intervention duration, or participant health status. Significant heterogeneity, small numbers of studies and inclusion of non-randomized trials or single-group pre-post trials were the main limitation of our meta-analysis. Further randomized clinical trials are needed to elucidate the effects of IF on liver function in adults with metabolic disorders.",

    "abstract": "Intermittent fasting (IF) has been demonstrated to enhance human health through several mechanisms. However, it is still unclear whether those health benefits are independent of caloric restriction (CR)-induced weight loss. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to compare isocaloric IF and CR regarding anthropometric measurements, adherence, metabolic profile, inflammatory biomarkers, and adipokines in adults and elderlies. Comprehensive research was conducted usin four major databases including Embase, PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar without date restriction. Mean differences of the change from baseline ± change SD were calculated as the differences between IF and CR groups. Subgroup analysis was performed according to intervention duration (short-, medium-, and long-term). To determine the reliability of our findings, GRADE assessment was performed. As a result, 20 RCTs were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. IF groups had significant reductions in fat mass (kg) (P = 0.006) and Interleukin-6 (P < 0.00001) in the short term and fat mass (%) (P = 0.0002), waist circumference (P = 0.005), fasting blood insulin (P < 0.00001) and HOMA-IR (P = 0.04) in the long term. CR groups had significantly lower hunger (P = 0.003), fatigue (P = 0.04), and TG (P = 0.03). IF may be an effective alternative to CR but is not superior to CR in enhancing human health. Due to the low number of long-term studies, future studies should focus on conducting longitudinal randomized trials comparing IF and CR in different populations, age groups, and IF patterns.",

    "abstract": "To provide an updated comprehensive evaluation of the quality and evidence association of existing studies on health outcomes related to intermittent fasting (IF). We conducted a systematic search of PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Embase databases, covering literature up to June 2024. Meta-analyses and systematic reviews that include adult populations and quantitatively analyse health outcomes related to IF interventional studies are included. For evidence with complete data, we reanalyzed health evidence effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals using random-effects models. Article quality and the certainty of the evidence were graded using A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR-2), Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system, and a standardized credibility grading system. Twelve meta-analysis studies and 122 health outcome associations with IF were identified. High-quality evidence indicated significant associations between time-restricted eating (TRE) and weight loss, fat mass reduction, decreased fasting insulin and glycosylated haemoglobin levels in overweight or obese adults, as well as between the 5:2 diet and reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Moderate-to-low-quality evidence suggested associations between modified alternate-day fasting and improvements in body weight, lipid profile and blood pressure. Additionally, high-to-low-quality evidence showed that IF regimens effectively improved liver health in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. This umbrella review highlights IF, especially TRE, as a promising intervention for weight and metabolic health, particularly beneficial for overweight or obese adults. We also highlight the need for further extensive research to understand the long-term effects, individualized IF plans and potential adverse effects of IF in different populations.",

    "abstract": "Randomized controlled trials have confirmed the effectiveness of four prevalent caloric restriction regimens in reducing obesity-related health risks. However, there is no consensus on the optimal regimen for weight management in adults. We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane CENTRAL up to January 15, 2024, for randomized controlled trials (RCT) involving adults, evaluating the weight-loss effects of alternate day fasting (ADF), short-term fasting (STF), time-restricted eating (TRE), and continuous energy restriction (CER). The primary outcome was body weight, with secondary outcomes including BMI, fat mass, lean mass, waist circumference, fasting glucose, HOMA-IR, and adverse events. Bayesian network meta-analysis was conducted, ranking regimens using the surface under the cumulative ranking curve and the probability of being the best. Study quality was assessed using the Confidence in Network Meta-Analysis tool. Data from 47 RCTs (representing 3363 participants) were included. ADF showed the most significant body weight loss (Mean difference (MD): -3.42; 95% Confidence interval (CI): -4.28 to -2.55), followed by TRE (MD: -2.25; 95% CI: -2.92 to -1.59). STF (MD: -1.87; 95% CI: -3.32 to -0.56) and CER (MD: -1.59; 95% CI: -2.42 to -0.79) rank third and fourth, respectively. STF lead to decline in lean mass (MD: -1.26; 95% CI: -2.16, -0.47). TRE showed benefits on fasting glucose (MD: -2.98; 95% CI: -4.7, -1.26). Subgroup analysis revealed all four caloric restriction regimens likely lead to modest weight loss after 1-3 months, with ADF ranked highest, but by 4-6 months, varying degrees of weight regain occur, particularly with CER, while interventions lasting 7-12 months may result in effective weight loss, with TRE potentially ranking first during both the 4-6 months and 7-12 months periods. ADF showing fewer and shorter-lasting physical symptoms. All four included regiments were effective in reducing body weight, with ADF likely having the most significant impact. Each regimen likely leads to modest weight loss after 1-3 months, followed by weight regain by 4-6 months. However, interventions lasting 7-12 months achieve greater weight loss overall.

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to utilize network meta-analysis (NMA) to synthesize relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and evaluate the most effective intermittent fasting (IF) combined with exercise interventions for weight loss. This study searched five databases up until April 2024, obtaining RCTs that investigated the effects of intermittent fasting (IF) combined with exercise. The quality of the literature was assessed using the Cochrane tool, followed by a random-effects statistical analysis of each intervention. Eventually, a NMA was conducted to compare the effectiveness of each intervention on weight loss, thereby determining their combined effectiveness on reducing weight. A total of nine trials, comparing 12 interventions involving 570 participants, were included. All interventions significantly reduced body weight (BW) and fat mass (FM) compared to the control (CON) group. In terms of BW reduction, the alternate-day fasting + moderate-intensity continuous training (ADF + MICT) intervention had the highest surface under the cumulative ranking curve average (SUCRA) score 88.1(MD: -4.44,95% CI -5.95, -2.92). Furthermore, for improving FM, the ADF + MICT intervention also had the highest SUCRA score 92.7(MD: -3.65,95% CI -5.05, -2.25), making it the optimal intervention for improving FM. The NMA results indicate that all interventions are effective in reducing weight. Among them, ADF + MICT is the most effective strategy for reducing BW, and it is also the best approach for improving FM.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is associated with one-fifth of cancer deaths, and breast cancer is one of the obesity-related cancers. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) lacks estrogen and progesterone receptors and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, leading to the absence of these therapeutic targets, followed by poor overall survival. We investigated if obesity could hasten TNBC progression and intermittent fasting (IF) could attenuate the progression of obesity-related TNBC. Our meta-analysis of the TNBC outcomes literature showed that obesity led to poorer overall survival in TNBC patients. Fasting-mimicking media reduced cell proliferation disrupted the cell cycle, and decreased cell migration and invasion. IF decreased body weight in obese mice but no change in normal mice. Obese mice exhibited elevated plasma glucose and cholesterol levels, increased tumor volume and weight, and enhanced macrophage accumulation in tumors. The obesity-exacerbated TNBC progression was attenuated after IF, which decreased cyclin B1 and vimentin levels and reduced the proinflammatory signature in the obesity-associated tumor microenvironment. IF attenuated obesity-induced TNBC progression through reduced obesity and tumor burdens in cell and animal experiments, supporting the potential of a cost-effective adjuvant IF therapy for TNBC through lifestyle change. Further evidence is needed of these IF benefits in TNBC, including from human clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "There is little evidence to comprehensively summarize the adverse events (AEs) profile of intermittent fasting (IF) despite its widespread use in patients with overweight or obesity. We searched the main electronic databases and registry websites to identify eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing IF versus control groups. A direct meta-analysis using a fixed-effect model was conducted to pool the risk differences regarding common AEs and dropouts. Study quality was assessed by using the Jadad scale. Pre-specified subgroup and sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore potential heterogeneity. A total of 15 RCTs involving 1,365 adult individuals were included. Findings did not show a significant difference between IF and Control in risk rate of fatigue [0%, 95% confidence interval (CI), -1% to 2%; P = 0.61], headache [0%, 95%CI: -1% to 2%; P = 0.86] and dropout [1%, 95%CI: -2% to 4%; P = 0.51]. However, a numerically higher risk of dizziness was noted among the IF alone subgroup with non-early time restricted eating [3%, 95%CI: -0% to 6%; P = 0.08]. This meta-analysis suggested that IF was not associated with a greater risk of AEs in adult patients affected by overweight or obesity. Additional large-scale RCTs stratified by key confounders and designed to evaluate the long-term effects of various IF regimens are needed to ascertain these AEs profile.",

    "abstract": "Cumulative evidence suggests that intermittent fasting (IF) has beneficial effects on human metabolic health. It has been indicated that its impact on the gut microbiota may mediate these beneficial effects. As a result, we hypothesized that IF may impact the human gut microbiota. A systematic review was carried out according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) protocol using the PubMed, Scopus, and CINAHL databases. We registered our systematic review protocol in PROSPERO under registration number CRD42021270050. Human intervention studies published until April 30, 2023, were included. The quality of the included studies was assessed using National Institutes of Health (NIH) quality assessment study tools for intervention studies. The search in the database returned 166 studies, of which 13 matched all criteria for the final qualitative analysis. The body of evidence suggests that IF modulates human gut microbiota alpha and beta diversity in lean (relatively healthy) and relatively healthy overweight/obese individuals but not in individuals with metabolic syndrome. Furthermore, IF also alters human gut microbiota composition in all phenotypes. Of interest, the gut microbiota taxa or microbial metabolites after an IF intervention are associated with metabolic markers. According to this review, IF influences the diversity and taxonomic levels of the human gut microbiota. Individual metabolic phenotypes may alter the effect of IF on the diversity and taxonomic levels of the gut microbiota.",

    "abstract": "Intermittent fasting (IF) and exercise training (Exe) have been evaluated in several studies for improving cardiometabolic biomarkers related to weight loss. However, further investigation is required to understand the potential effects on leptin and adiponectin concentrations. IF protocols have been shown to be efficient in improving adipokines, but further research is required to determine whether or not IF regimens combined with Exe are superior to Exe alone. The aim of this study was to determine whether or not interventions combining IF plus Exe are more effective than Exe only for improving serum leptin and adiponectin in adults with and without obesity. A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed by searching PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases up to August 2023 for randomized clinical trials that determined the effects of IF plus Exe vs. Exe alone (control) on body weight, serum leptin, and serum adiponectin. Analyses were conducted for IF plus Exe vs. Exe alone to calculate weighted mean differences (WMD) and standardized mean differences (SMD). The current meta-analysis included 6 studies with a total sample of 153 participants, with intervention durations ranging from three days to 52 weeks. IF plus Exe elicited significantly larger decreases in leptin levels [SMD = -0.47,  IF combined with Exe reduced leptin significantly, but did not change adiponectin levels, when compared to exercise only. Perhaps these reductions in leptin levels may have been associated with weight loss; however, due to the small number of included studies and the high heterogeneity in the weight loss outcomes, this result is uncertain. https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/, identifier CRD42023460735.",

    "abstract": "Benefits of Intermittent fasting (IF) on health-related outcomes have been found in a range of randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Our umbrella review aimed to systematically analyze and synthesize the available causal evidence on IF and its impact on specific health-related outcomes while evaluating its evidence quality. We comprehensively searched the PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases (from inception up to 8 January 2024) to identify related systematic reviews and meta-analyses of RCTs investigating the association between IF and human health outcomes. We recalculated the effect sizes for each meta-analysis as mean difference (MD) or standardized mean difference (SMD) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Subgroup analyses were performed for populations based on three specific status: diabetes, overweight or obesity, and metabolic syndrome. The quality of systematic reviews was evaluated using A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR), and the certainty of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) system. This study is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42023382004). A total of 351 associations from 23 meta-analyses with 34 health outcomes were included in the study. A wide range of outcomes were investigated, including anthropometric measures (n = 155), lipid profiles (n = 83), glycemic profiles (n = 57), circulatory system index (n = 41), appetite (n = 9), and others (n = 6). Twenty-one (91%) meta-analyses with 346 associations were rated as high confidence according to the AMSTAR criteria. The summary effects estimates were significant at  Our findings suggest that IF may have beneficial effects on a range of health outcomes for adults with overweight or obesity, compared to CER or non-intervention diet. Specifically, IF may decreased WC, fat mass, LDL-C, TG, TC, fasting insulin, and SBP, while increasing HDL-C and FFM. Notably, it is worth noting that the SBP lowering effect of IF appears to be weaker than that of CER.

    "abstract": "Daily rhythms of metabolic function are supported by molecular circadian clock systems that are strongly regulated by feeding and fasting. Intermittent fasting diets have been associated with weight loss and improved metabolism. However, the effects of time-restricted eating (TRE) on glycemic parameters are still under debate. In this review, we aim to systematically analyze the effects of TRE on glycemic parameters. We searched on PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library for controlled studies in which subjects followed TRE for at least 4 weeks. 20 studies were included in the qualitative systematic review, and 18 studies (n = 1169 subjects) were included in the meta-analysis. Overall, TRE had no significant effect on fasting glucose (Hedges's g = -0.08; 95% CI:-0.31,0.16; p = 0.52), but it did reduce HbA1c levels (Hedges's g = -0.27; 95% CI: -0.47, -0.06; p = 0.01). TRE significantly reduced fasting insulin (Hedges's g = -0.40; 95% CI: -0.73,-0.08; p = 0.01) and showed a tendency to decrease HOMA-IR (Hedges's g = -0.32; 95% CI:-0.66,0.02; p = 0.06). Interestingly, a cumulative analysis showed that the beneficial effects of TRE regarding glucose levels were less apparent as studies with later TRE windows (lTRE) were being included. Indeed, a subgroup analysis of the early TRE (eTRE) studies revealed that fasting glucose was significantly reduced by eTRE (Hedges's g = -0.38; 95% CI:-0.62, -0.14; p < 0.01). Our meta-analysis suggests that TRE can reduce HbA1c and insulin levels, and that timing of food intake is a crucial factor in the metabolic benefit of TRE, as only eTRE is capable of reducing fasting glucose levels in subjects with overweight or obesity.PROSPERO registration number CRD42023405946.",

ADF was superior to CER and 5:2 diet in reducing waist circumference, whereas 5:2 diet was superior to CER in reducing BMI. Regarding fat mass and drop-out, all forms of IER were comparable. Sensitivity analyses indicated that the type of individuals had no influence on the pooled results; nevertheless, ADF significantly reduced weight compared to CER and achieved significant waist circumference reduction compared to CER, 5:2 diet, and TRF. ADF may be preferentially prescribed for overweight or obese adults. More large-scale and high-quality studies are required, however, to investigate the effect of TRF on overweight and obesity.",

    "abstract": "No previous systematic review or meta-analysis has evaluated the effect of optimal time-restricted eating (TRE) interventions on cardiovascular (CVD) risk factors. This meta-analysis aimed to illustrate the effect of a suitable TRE on CVD risk factors. A systematic review was performed to identify trials reporting the effects of TRE, relative to non-diet controls, on CVD risk factors in humans. A random-effects model was used to evaluate the effect sizes, and the results are expressed as the mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Subgroup analyses were performed to examine the influence of the study population, age, duration of intervention, and baseline mean BMI on the CVD indexes. TRE intervention significantly reduced systolic pressure (SBP) (MD: -3.45 mmHg; 95%CI:(-6.20,-0.71) mmHg; P = 0.01), body weight (MD: -1.63 Kg; 95%CI:(-2.09,-1.17) Kg; P<0.001), body mass index (BMI) (MD: -0.47 Kg/m Relative to a non-diet control, TRE is effective for the improvement of CVD risks. Moreover, individual TRE interventions should be developed for different populations to achieve the most effective health improvement for CVD risk factors.",

    "abstract": "The interest in intermittent energy restriction (IER) diets as a weight-loss approach is increasing. Different IER protocols exist, including time-restricted eating (TRE), alternate-day fasting (ADF), and the 5:2 diet. This meta-analysis compared the effects of these IER diets with continuous energy restriction (CER) on anthropometrics and cardiometabolic risk markers in healthy adults. Twenty-eight trials were identified that studied TRE (k = 7), ADF (k = 10), or the 5:2 diet (k = 11) for 2-52 wk. Energy intakes between intervention groups within a study were comparable (17 trials), lower in IER (5 trials), or not reported (6 trials). Weighted mean differences (WMDs) were calculated using fixed- or random-effects models. Changes in body weight [WMD: -0.42 kg; 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.96 to 0.13; P = 0.132] and fat mass (FM) (WMD: -0.31 kg; 95% CI: -0.98 to 0.36; P = 0.362) were comparable when results of the 3 IER diets were combined and compared with those of CER. All IER diets combined reduced fat-free mass (WMD: -0.20 kg; 95% CI: -0.39 to -0.01; P = 0.044) and waist circumference (WMD: -0.91 cm; 95% CI: -1.76 to -0.06; P = 0.036) more than CER.

    "abstract": "Time-restricted eating (TRE) is a dietary approach that limits eating to a set number of hours per day. Human studies on the effects of TRE intervention on cardiometabolic health have been contradictory. Heterogeneity in subjects and TRE interventions have led to inconsistency in results. Furthermore, the impact of the duration of eating/fasting in the TRE approach has yet to be fully explored. To analyze the existing literature on the effects of TRE with different eating durations on anthropometrics and cardiometabolic health markers in adults with excessive weight and obesity-related metabolic diseases. We reviewed a series of prominent scientific databases, including Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, Academic Search Complete, and Cochrane Library articles to identify published clinical trials on daily TRE in adults with excessive weight and obesity-related metabolic diseases. Randomized controlled trials were assessed for methodological rigor and risk of bias using version 2 of the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials (RoB-2). Outcomes of interest include body weight, waist circumference, fat mass, lean body mass, fasting glucose, insulin, HbA1c, homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), lipid profiles, C-reactive protein, blood pressure, and heart rate. Fifteen studies were included in our systematic review. TRE significantly reduces body weight, waist circumference, fat mass, lean body mass, blood glucose, insulin, and triglyceride. However, no significant changes were observed in HbA1c, HOMA-IR, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Furthermore, subgroup analyses based on the duration of the eating window revealed significant variation in the effects of TRE intervention depending on the length of the eating window. TRE is a promising chrononutrition-based dietary approach for improving anthropometric and cardiometabolic health. However, further clinical trials are needed to determine the optimal eating duration in TRE intervention for cardiovascular disease prevention.",

We searched and screened PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science from inception to May 8, 2022 for randomized controlled trials. Two review authors independently selected studies, extracted data, assessed quality and risk of bias and cross-checked extracts to resolve discrepancies when required. We expressed effect size as mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence interval (CI). The major outcome was the improvement of MetS risk factors, including changes in waist circumference (WC), triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), blood pressure (BP), and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels. The secondary outcomes were body weight (BW), body mass index (BMI), body fat (BF), fat free mass (FFM), hip circumference (HC), fasting insulin (FINs), total cholesterol (TC), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c). The meta-analysis included 16 articles (20 trials) with a total of 1,511 participants. All studies had a low risk of bias for random sequence generation. The IER and CER intervention equally improved MetS risk factors WC (MD = -0.47, 95% CI [-1.19, 0.25]), TG (MD = -0.02 mmol/L, 95% CI [-0.11, 0.07]), FPG (MD = -0.02 mmol/L, 95% CI [-0.10, 0.05]) and BP (systolic blood pressure: MD = 0.93 mmHg, 95% CI [-2.74, 4.61]; diastolic blood pressure: MD =1.15 mmHg, 95% CI [-0.24, 2.55]), but HDL-c (MD = 0.03 mmol/L, 95% CI [0.01, 0.05]) was significant improved in IER when compared with CER. For second outcomes, BW (MD = -0.8 kg, 95% CI [-1.26, -0.33]), BF (MD = -0.75 kg, 95% CI [-1.73, -0.13]) and FFM (MD = -0.49 kg, 95% CI [-0.92, -0.05]) were also significant improved in IER, and not for other outcomes. Both IER and CER could improve MetS biomarkers, but IER was more effective than CER in the improvement of HDL-c only. For secondary outcomes, IER was also more effective for BW, BF and FFM, but there were no differences in effects for other outcomes.",

    "abstract": "The retirement phase is an opportunity to integrate healthy (nutrition/exercise) habits into daily life. We conducted this systematic review to assess which nutrition and exercise interventions most effectively improve body composition (fat/muscle mass), body mass index (BMI), and waist circumference (WC) in persons with obesity/overweight near retirement age (ages 55-70 y). We conducted a systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) of randomized controlled trials, searching 4 databases from their inception up to July 12, 2022. The NMA was based on a random effects model, pooled mean differences, standardized mean differences, their 95% confidence intervals, and correlations with multi-arm studies. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were also conducted. Ninety-two studies were included, 66 of which with 4957 participants could be used for the NMA. Identified interventions were clustered into 12 groups: no intervention, energy restriction (i.e., 500-1000 kcal), energy restriction plus high-protein intake (1.1-1.7 g/kg/body weight), intermittent fasting, mixed exercise (aerobic and resistance), resistance training, aerobic training, high protein plus resistance training, energy restriction plus high protein plus exercise, energy restriction plus resistance training, energy restriction plus aerobic training, and energy restriction plus mixed exercise. Intervention durations ranged from 8 wk to 6 mo. Body fat was reduced with energy restriction plus any exercise or plus high-protein intake. Energy restriction alone was less effective and tended to decrease muscle mass. Muscle mass was only significantly increased with mixed exercise. All other interventions including exercise effectively preserved muscle mass. A BMI and/or WC decrease was achieved with all interventions except aerobic training/resistance training alone or resistance training plus high protein. Overall, the most effective strategy for nearly all outcomes was combining energy restriction with resistance training or mixed exercise and high protein. Health care professionals involved in the management of persons with obesity need to be aware that an energy-restricted diet alone may contribute to sarcopenic obesity in persons near retirement age.

Three databases were searched from 2011 to June 2021 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed weight loss and IF, including alternate day fasting (ADF), the 5:2 diet, and time-restricted eating (TRE). A random effect network analysis was used to compare the effectiveness between the three regimens. Meta-regression analysis was presented as weighted mean differences of body weight loss. The exploratory random effects network analysis of 24 RCTs (n = 1768) ranked ADF as the most effective, followed by CER and TRE. The meta-analysis showed that IF regimens resulted in similar weight loss to CER (mean difference 0.26 kg, 95% CI: -0.31 to 0.84; p = 0.37). Compliance was generally high (>80%) in trials shorter than 3 months. The present meta-analysis concludes that IF is comparable to CER and a promising alternative for weight loss. Among the three regimens, ADF showed the highest effectiveness for weight loss, followed by CER and TRE. Further well-powered RCTs with longer durations of intervention are required to draw solid conclusions.",

    "abstract": "Time-restricted eating (TRE), which restricts food intake to a limited duration of the day, is a key regimen of intermittent fasting. The aim of our study was to provide an up-to-date meta-analysis and systematic review to evaluate the efficacy of TRE on weight loss and other metabolic-related parameters in adults. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library for relevant studies published before February 26, 2022. Study duration of TRE was at least 4 weeks. Body weight and other metabolic-related continuous parameters were described as weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% CI. Seventeen randomized controlled trials involving 899 participants were analyzed. The pooled meta-analysis has shown that TRE contributed to a significant decrease in body weight with a WMD of -1.60 kg (95% CI -2.27 to -0.93) and fat mass with WMD -1.48 kg (95% CI -1.59 to -1.38). Subgroup analysis showed that TRE could reduce body weight and fat mass especially in overweight participants with WMD -1.43 kg (95% CI -2.05 to -0.81) and -1.56 kg (95% CI -1.67 to -1.44), respectively. TRE also showed beneficial effects on the lipid spectrum in overweight participants, including decreased levels of triglyceride (WMD -12.71 mg/dL, 95% CI -24.9 to -0.52), total cholesterol (WMD -6.45 mg/dL, 95% CI -7.40 to -5.49), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (WMD -7.0 mg/dL, 95% CI -9.74 to -4.25). However, compared with control, TRE had no significant effects on waist circumference, body mass index, glycosylated hemoglobin, or blood pressure. This updated meta-analysis found that TRE may be an effective approach to improve the metabolic state of nonobese subjects, especially in overweight participants.",

In this meta-analysis, we compare the effects of IER and CER on obesity using evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs). A systematic electronic literature search was conducted to find RCTs published between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2021 that directly compared IER and CER for an active weight loss period of at least 12 weeks and reported obesity indices or metabolic markers in adults with overweight or obesity. Finally, 16 RCTs from 25 articles with 1,438 participants were included. The attrition rates were 26.6% and 24.1% in the IER and CER groups, respectively, with no significant differences in changes in body weight, waist circumference, or body fat composition. CER changed blood glucose levels more than IER, but there was no significant difference in glycated hemoglobin levels. Systolic blood pressure was significantly lower in the CER group than the IER group, but diastolic blood pressure did not differ significantly between the groups. Changes in blood lipids did not differ significantly between the interventions. No differences between IER and CER were observed in the sensitivity analyses. IER can be an alternative to CER because it induces comparable weight reduction and metabolic improvement. However, the effect of IER was not superior to that of CER, and its attrition rate was not lower than that of CER.",

    "abstract": "Carbohydrate-restricted diets and intermittent fasting (IF) have been rapidly gaining interest among the general population and patients with cardiometabolic disease, such as overweight or obesity, diabetes, and hypertension. However, there are limited expert recommendations for these dietary regimens. This study aimed to evaluate the level of scientific evidence on the benefits and harms of carbohydrate-restricted diets and IF to make responsible recommendations. A meta-analysis and systematic literature review of 66 articles on 50 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of carbohydrate-restricted diets and 10 articles on eight RCTs of IF was performed. Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are suggested. In adults with overweight or obesity, a moderately-low carbohydrate or low carbohydrate diet (mLCD) can be considered as a dietary regimen for weight reduction. In adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus, mLCD can be considered as a dietary regimen for improving glycemic control and reducing body weight. In contrast, a very-low carbohydrate diet (VLCD) and IF are recommended against in patients with diabetes. Furthermore, no recommendations are suggested for VLCD and IF in adults with overweight or obesity, and carbohydrate-restricted diets and IF in patients with hypertension. Here, we describe the results of our analysis and the evidence for these recommendations.",

    "abstract": "The Joint Committee of the Korean Diabetes Association, the Korean Society for the Study of Obesity, and the Korean Society of Hypertension announced a consensus statement on carbohydrate-restricted diets and intermittent fasting, representing an emerging and popular dietary pattern. In this statement, we recommend moderately-low-carbohydrate or low-carbohydrate diets, not a very-low-carbohydrate diet, for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. These diets can be considered a dietary regimen to improve glycemic control and reduce body weight in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. This review provides the detailed results of a meta-analysis and systematic literature review on the potential harms and benefits of carbohydrate-restricted diets in patients with diabetes. We expect that this review will help experts and patients by fostering an in-depth understanding and appropriate application of carbohydrate-restricted diets in the comprehensive management of diabetes.",

This study aimed to systematically explore the effects of various IF in humans. The randomized controlled trials (RCTs) related to IF vs. non-intervention diet or caloric restriction (CR) were retrieved in PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library database, and Embase. Extraction outcomes included, but were not limited to, weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), fasting glucose, and triglyceride (TG). This study includes 43 RCTs with 2,483 participants. The intervention time was at least 1 month, and the median intervention time was 3 months. Contrasting results between IF and non-intervention diet showed that participants had lower weight (weighted mean difference (WMD) = 1.10, 95% CI: 0.09-2.12,  Intermittent fasting was more beneficial in reducing body weight, WC, and FM without affecting lean mass compared to the non-intervention diet. IF also effectively improved insulin resistance and blood lipid conditions compared with non-intervention diets. However, IF showed less benefit over CR.",

    "abstract": "Several meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have demonstrated the many health benefits of intermittent fasting (IF). However, there has been little synthesis of the strength and quality of this evidence in aggregate to date. To grade the evidence from published meta-analyses of RCTs that assessed the associations of IF (zero-calorie alternate-day fasting, modified alternate-day fasting, the 5:2 diet, and time-restricted eating) with obesity-related health outcomes. PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane database of systematic reviews were searched from database inception to January 12, 2021. Data analysis was conducted from April 2021 through July 2021. Meta-analyses of RCTs investigating effects of IF in adults were included. The effect sizes of IF were recalculated using a random-effects model. We assessed the quality of evidence per association by applying the GRADE criteria (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations) as high, moderate, low, and very low. A total of 11 meta-analyses comprising 130 RCTs (median [IQR] sample size, 38 [24-69] participants; median [IQR] follow-up period, 3 [2-5] months) were included describing 104 unique associations of different types of IF with obesity-related health outcomes (median [IQR] studies per association, 4 [3-5]). There were 28 statistically significant associations (27%) that demonstrated the beneficial outcomes for body mass index, body weight, fat mass, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting plasma glucose, fasting insulin, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance, and blood pressure. IF was found to be associated with reduced fat-free mass. One significant association (1%) supported by high-quality evidence was modified alternate-day fasting for 1 to 2 months, which was associated with moderate reduction in body mass index in healthy adults and adults with overweight, obesity, or nonalcoholic fatty liver disease compared with regular diet. Six associations (6%) were supported by moderate quality evidence. The remaining associations found to be significant were supported by very low (75 associations [72%]) to low (22 associations [21%]) quality evidence. In this umbrella review, we found beneficial associations of IF with anthropometric and cardiometabolic outcomes supported by moderate to high quality of evidence, which supports the role of IF, especially modified alternate-day fasting, as a weight loss approach for adults with overweight or obesity. More clinical trials with long-term follow-up are needed to investigate the effects of IF on clinical outcomes such as cardiovascular events and mortality.",

Moreover, IF had a better effect on weight loss (-1.70, 95% CI -3.28 to -0.11 kg). Patients in both groups experienced similar improvements in fasting insulin and lipid profile as well as similar hypoglycemic events.

Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the effect size for changes in liver function tests (LFT) in healthy people practicing Ramadan diurnal intermittent fasting (RDIF), and to examine the impact of different covariates using subgroup analysis and meta-regression. Scientific databases were searched from date of inception in 1950 to the end of July 2020. The liver function tests searched and analyzed were aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), bilirubin (BLU), L-lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and prothrombin time (PT). Twenty studies (601 adult participants in total, aged 18-57 years) conducted in 10 countries between 1987 and 2020 were identified. RDIF-induced effect sizes for the LFT expressed as standardized mean difference (SMD) [95% confidence interval] were: AST (no. of studies K = 16, number of subjects N = 502, SMD = -0.257 [-0.381, -0.133], I RDIF induces significant but small (AST, ALP, BLU) to medium (GGT) positive changes on LFT, and may confer a transient, short-term protection against fatty liver disease in healthy subjects.",

    "abstract": "Ramadan intermittent fasting may affect whole-body metabolism by affecting appetite-related hormones. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to clarify the possible effects of Ramadan intermittent fasting on the main hormones regulating appetite and satiety, including leptin and adiponectin. All English language papers in the PubMed, Scopus, and Embase databases were searched using the keywords \"Ramadan fasting\", \"adiponectin\", and \"leptin\", up to 2020. Data extraction was conducted based on the main data of the studies; the primary outcomes of the analysis were mean changes of adiponectin and leptin levels during the holy month of Ramadan in fasted subjects. Data of 16 eligible studies, conducted between 2003 and 2020, were included in the systematic review. Of these, 10 studies with complete data on leptin and adiponectin were included in the meta-analysis. A significant decrease in leptin levels was observed after Ramadan fasting (WMD = -2.28 ng/ml, 95% CI = -3.72, -0.84). Ramadan fasting had no significant effect on adiponectin levels (WMD = 2.19 ng/ml, 95% CI = -0.29, 4.67). Sub-group analysis demonstrated a greater decrease in leptin levels among normal-weight subjects compared to those of overweight/obese subjects (WMD = -4.67 ng/ml, 95% CI = -6.03, -3.31 vs. WMD = -3.43 ng/ml, 95% CI = -5.69, -1.17). Ramadan fasting may decrease leptin levels, especially in normal-weight subjects. There was high heterogeneity, which may be explained by the differences between the wide ranges of study conditions.",

    "abstract": "Intermittent fasting (IF) has been proposed as a weight-loss strategy with additional cardiometabolic benefits in individuals with obesity. Despite its growing popularity, the effect of IF in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) remains unclear. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the metabolic impact of IF compared to standard diet in patients with T2DM. Embase, PubMed, and clinicaltrials.gov between 1950 and August 12, 2020 were searched for randomized, diet-controlled studies evaluating any IF intervention in adults with T2DM. We examined the impact of IF on weight loss and glucose-lowering by calculating pooled estimates of the absolute differences in body weight and glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) compared to a control group using a random-effects model. Seven studies (n = 338 participants; mean body mass index [BMI] 35.65, mean baseline HbA1c 8.8%) met our inclusion criteria. IF induced a greater decrease in body weight by -1.89 kg (95% CI, -2.91 to -0.86 kg) compared to a regular diet, with no significant between-study heterogeneity (I2 21.0%, P = .28). The additional weight loss induced by IF was greater in studies with a heavier population (BMI > 36) (-3.43 kg [95% CI, -5.72 to -1.15 kg]) and in studies of shorter duration (≤ 4 months) (-3.73 kg [95% CI, -7.11 to -0.36 kg]). IF was not associated with further reduction in HbA1c compared to a standard diet (HbA1c -0.11% [95% CI, -0.38% to 0.17%]). Current evidence suggests that IF is associated with greater weight loss in patients with T2DM compared with a standard diet, with a similar impact on glycemic control.",

This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of an IF diet to reduce anthropometric parameters (body mass index, body weight, and waist circumference), change body composition (fat mass, lean body mass and muscle mass) and lipid profile (total cholesterol, HDL-c, LDL-c and triglycerides), and to adhere to the diet in comparison to continuous energy restriction (CER) in overweight or obese adults. A research question PICO (patients, intervention, comparison, outcome) was established. PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane, and Scielo databases were searched to identify randomized clinical trials that compared an IF diet with a CER diet or a regular diet. DeCS and MeSH descriptors and Boolean operators (AND and OR) were used. From 859 studies identified through the literature search, 18 articles were finally selected. Overall, IF diets were associated with higher weight loss in four studies and similar reduction in waist circumference in one study, compared with a CER regimen. Fat mass tended to decrease more in the IF groups in five studies. However, the lean and muscle mass loss was similar in both groups. Only three studies observed significant differences in lipid profile variables, mostly in the IF groups. Adherence to the diet was inconclusive. An IF diet may provide a benefit by improving anthropometry, body composition, and lipid profile in overweight or obese adult population, likewise a CER diet.",

    "abstract": "Alternate-day fasting (ADF) is related to weight reduction, lowered risks of weight regain, and relative lean body mass preservation compared to continuous energy restriction. This meta-analysis aimed to assess the effects of ADF on obesity-related factors and cardiometabolic risk factors in adults. Using PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane online databases, an electronic search was performed. Randomized controlled trials were investigated to evaluate ADF effects on body mass index (BMI), body weight (BW), waist circumference, body fat mass (FM), lean body mass, and cardiometabolic risk factors in adults aged ≥18 years. By utilizing a random-effects model, meta-analyses to assess weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were performed for eight randomized controlled trials (total participants = 728). We observed significant effects of ADF for BMI (WMD -0.73 kg/m Current evidence suggests that ADF effectively lowers BMI, BW, FM, and total cholesterol in adults with overweight within 6 months compared to the control.",

    "title": "Beneficial Effects of Time-Restricted Eating on Metabolic Diseases: A Systemic Review and Meta-Analysis.",
    "abstract": "Various behavioral and physiological pathways follow a pre-determined, 24 hour cycle known as the circadian rhythm. Metabolic homeostasis is regulated by the circadian rhythm. Time-restricted eating (TRE) is a type of intermittent fasting based on the circadian rhythm. In this study, we aim to analyze systemically the effects of TRE on body weight, body composition, and other metabolic parameters. We reviewed articles from PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library to identify clinical trials that compared TRE to a regular diet. We included 19 studies for meta-analysis. Participants following TRE showed significantly reduced body weight (mean difference (MD), -0.90; 95% confidence interval (CI): -1.71 to -0.10) and fat mass (MD: -1.58, 95% CI: -2.64 to -0.51), while preserving fat-free mass (MD, -0.24; 95% CI: -1.15 to 0.67). TRE also showed beneficial effects on cardiometabolic parameters such as blood pressure (systolic BP, MD, -3.07; 95% CI: -5.76 to -0.37), fasting glucose concentration (MD, -2.96; 95% CI, -5.60 to -0.33), and cholesterol profiles (triglycerides, MD: -11.60, 95% CI: -23.30 to -0.27). In conclusion, TRE is a promising therapeutic strategy for controlling weight and improving metabolic dysfunctions in those who are overweight or obese. Further large-scale clinical trials are needed to confirm these findings and the usefulness of TRE.",

    "abstract": "Studies on the effect of Ramadan diurnal intermittent fasting (RDIF) on body weight have yielded conflicting results. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the effect size of body weight changes in healthy, non-athletic Muslims practicing Ramadan fasting, and to assess the effect of covariates such as age, sex, fasting time duration, season, and country, using subgroup analysis, and meta-regression. Covariate adjustments were performed to explain the variability of weight change in response to Ramadan fasting. CINAHL, Cochrane, EBSCOhost, EMBASE, Google Scholar, ProQuest Medical, PubMed/MEDLINE, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were searched from date of inception in 1950 to the end of August 2019. Eighty-five studies, conducted in 25 countries during 1982-2019, were identified. RDIF yielded a significant, but small reduction in body weight (K = 85, number of subjects, N = 4176 (aged 16-80 years), Hedges' g =- 0.360, 95% confidence interval (CI) - 0.405 to - 0.315, I RDIF may confer a significant small reduction in body weight in non-athletic healthy people aged 16 years and above, directly associated with fasting time and variably correlated with the season, and country.",

    "title": "Intermittent versus continuous energy restriction on weight loss and cardiometabolic outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.",
    "abstract": "This systematic review and meta-analysis summarized the most recent evidence on the efficacy of intermittent energy restriction (IER) versus continuous energy restriction on weight-loss, body composition, blood pressure and other cardiometabolic risk factors. Randomized controlled trials were systematically searched from MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, TRIP databases, EMBASE and CINAHL until May 2018. Effect sizes were expressed as weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Eleven trials were included (duration range 8-24 weeks). All selected intermittent regimens provided ≤ 25% of daily energy needs on \"fast\" days but differed for type of regimen (5:2 or other regimens) and/or dietary instructions given on the \"feed\" days (ad libitum energy versus balanced energy consumption). The intermittent approach determined a comparable weight-loss (WMD: - 0.61 kg; 95% CI - 1.70 to 0.47; p = 0.87) or percent weight loss (WMD: - 0.38%, - 1.16 to 0.40; p = 0.34) when compared to the continuous approach. A slight reduction in fasting insulin concentrations was evident with IER regimens (WMD = - 0.89 µU/mL; - 1.56 to - 0.22; p = 0.009), but the clinical relevance of this result is uncertain. No between-arms differences in the other variables were found. Both intermittent and continuous energy restriction achieved a comparable effect in promoting weight-loss and metabolic improvements. Long-term trials are needed to draw definitive conclusions.",

    "title": "Intermittent fasting interventions for treatment of overweight and obesity in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis.",
    "abstract": "To examine the effectiveness of intermittent energy restriction in the treatment for overweight and obesity in adults, when compared to usual care treatment or no treatment. Intermittent energy restriction encompasses dietary approaches including intermittent fasting, alternate day fasting, and fasting for two days per week. Despite the recent popularity of intermittent energy restriction and associated weight loss claims, the supporting evidence base is limited. This review included overweight or obese (BMI ≥25 kg/m) adults (≥18 years). Intermittent energy restriction was defined as consumption of ≤800 kcal on at least one day, but no more than six days per week. Intermittent energy restriction interventions were compared to no treatment (ad libitum diet) or usual care (continuous energy restriction ∼25% of recommended energy intake). Included interventions had a minimum duration of 12 weeks from baseline to post outcome measurements. The types of studies included were randomized and pseudo-randomized controlled trials. The primary outcome of this review was change in body weight. Secondary outcomes included: i) anthropometric outcomes (change in BMI, waist circumference, fat mass, fat free mass); ii) cardio-metabolic outcomes (change in blood glucose and insulin, lipoprotein profiles and blood pressure); and iii) lifestyle outcomes: diet, physical activity, quality of life and adverse events. A systematic search was conducted from database inception to November 2015. The following electronic databases were searched: MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, ISRCTN registry, and anzctr.org.au for English language published studies, protocols and trials. Two independent reviewers evaluated the methodological quality of included studies using the standardized critical appraisal instruments from the Joanna Briggs Institute. Data were extracted from papers included in the review by two independent reviewers using the standardized data extraction tool from the Joanna Briggs Institute. Effect sizes were expressed as weighted mean differences and their 95% confidence intervals were calculated for meta-analyses. Six studies were included in this review. The intermittent energy restriction regimens varied across studies and included alternate day fasting, fasting for two days, and up to four days per week. The duration of studies ranged from three to 12 months. Four studies included continuous energy restriction as a comparator intervention and two studies included a no treatment control intervention. Meta-analyses showed that intermittent energy restriction was more effective than no treatment for weight loss (-4.14 kg; 95% CI -6.30 kg to -1.99 kg; p ≤ 0.001). Although both treatment interventions achieved similar changes in body weight (approximately 7 kg), the pooled estimate for studies that investigated the effect of intermittent energy restriction in comparison to continuous energy restriction revealed no significant difference in weight loss (-1.03 kg; 95% CI -2.46 kg to 0.40 kg; p = 0.156). Intermittent energy restriction may be an effective strategy for the treatment of overweight and obesity. Intermittent energy restriction was comparable to continuous energy restriction for short term weight loss in overweight and obese adults. Intermittent energy restriction was shown to be more effective than no treatment, however, this should be interpreted cautiously due to the small number of studies and future research is warranted to confirm the findings of this review.",

    "abstract": "In developing countries the rise of obesity and obesity-related metabolic disorders, such as cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes, reflects the changes in lifestyle habits and wrong dietary choices. Dietary restriction (DR) regimens have been shown to extend health span and lifespan in many animal models including primates. Identifying biomarkers predictive of clinical benefits of treatment is one of the primary goals of precision medicine. To monitor the clinical outcomes of DR interventions in humans, several biomarkers are commonly adopted. However, a validated link between the behaviors of such biomarkers and DR effects is lacking at present time. Through a systematic analysis of human intervention studies, we evaluated the effect size of DR (i.e. calorie restriction, very low calorie diet, intermittent fasting, alternate day fasting) on health-related biomarkers. We found that DR is effective in reducing total and visceral adipose mass and improving inflammatory cytokines profile and adiponectin/leptin ratio. By analysing the levels of canonical biomarkers of healthy aging, we also validated the changes of insulin, IGF-1 and IGFBP-1,2 to monitor DR effects. Collectively, we developed a useful platform to evaluate the human responses to dietary regimens low in calories.",

    "title": "Intermittent fasting interventions for the treatment of overweight and obesity in adults aged 18 years and over: a systematic review protocol.",
    "abstract": "Are intermittent fasting interventions an effective treatment for overweight and obesity in adults, when compared to usual care treatment (continuous daily energy restriction - reduced calorie diet) or no treatment (ad libitum diet)? Overweight and obesity (classified as Body Mass Index [BMI] of greater than or equal to 25 and 30 respectively) is a global public health concern, with more than 1.9 billion adults worldwide being overweight in 2014 (over 600 million of whom are obese), and resulting in more deaths than underweight. A raised BMI in adulthood is associated with an increased risk of developing a number of chronic diseases which include diabetes, cardiovascular disease, muscular skeletal disorders and some cancers. In addition to this substantial impact on individual health and well being, there are also significant wider costs, for example, in England the annual direct cost to the national health service for treating overweight, obesity and associated morbidity is estimated at over £5 billion pounds, with costs to the wider economy estimated at £27 billion. Therefore effective weight management is essential.As overweight and obesity results from an accumulation of excess body fat arising from an energy imbalance - consuming more energy (kcal) than is expended - the majority of weight management approaches center around behaviors to address this imbalance, i.e. reducing energy intake through caloric restriction and increasing energy expenditure through physical activity. However, the aetiology of overweight and obesity is highly complex, involving an interplay of biological, psychological, societal and environmental drivers. Consequently, effective weight management is challenging, and whilst there exists a plethora of available weight loss programs, not all are comprehensively evaluated and compared, and many weight loss attempts result in weight regain and poor long term results. It is therefore vitally important to review the effectiveness of all new approaches to support an evidence-based approach to weight management.Intermittent fasting (IF), also known as alternate day fasting (ADF), periodic fasting or intermittent energy restriction (IER) is a relatively new dietary approach to weight management that involves interspersing normal daily caloric intake with a short period of severe calorie restriction/fasting. In terms of the possible underlying biological benefits of intermittent fasting, there is some evidence, predominantly from animal studies, to demonstrate beneficial effects on weight loss and cardio-metabolic risk factors. Whilst the underpinning mechanistic evidence is limited, there is some evidence to suggest that the benefits may be explained mechanistically through fat utilization and nutritional stress. However current National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance on the treatment of adult obesity does not recommend the routine use of very low calorie diets (VLCD) (defined as a hypocaloric diet of 800 or less kcal/day) for the treatment of adult obesity. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence states that this approach should only be recommended if there is a clinical rationale for rapid weight loss and must be nutritionally complete, part of a multi-component weight management strategy, including ongoing support, and should be undertaken for a maximum of 12 weeks (followed continuously or intermittently). Furthermore, the British Dietetic Association raises concerns that rapid weight loss associated with fasting may largely be due to loss of water and glycogen rather than fat, and may result in fatigue, dizziness and low energy levels. Essentially IF involves the intermittent use of a VLCD, and there remain questions about the side effects of this approach, whether there is an optimal fasting pattern or calorie limit, and how sustainable it is for long term weight management.Intermittent fasting has recently gained much popularity following significant media attention. In the UK this dietary approach reached mainstream after a BBC Horizon documentary aired in August 2012, featured an IF approach called the 5:2 diet, which involves five days of regular eating patterns interchanged with two days of fasting (max 500kcal for women and 600kcal for men). However other IF patterns are used such as alternate day fasting. Despite the recent popularity of intermittent fasting and associated weight loss claims, the supporting evidence base in humans remains small and there is only one published systematic review examining the health benefits of this approach. However the aim of this review was to examine the impact of this intervention on wider health benefits (not specifically as a treatment approach for overweight and obesity), and did not provide a comprehensive methodology or meta-analysis of RCT data. This proposed review will hence address these gaps in the evidence base.",

    "title": "Do intermittent diets provide physiological benefits over continuous diets for weight loss? A systematic review of clinical trials.",
    "abstract": "Energy restriction induces physiological effects that hinder further weight loss. Thus, deliberate periods of energy balance during weight loss interventions may attenuate these adaptive responses to energy restriction and thereby increase the efficiency of weight loss (i.e. the amount of weight or fat lost per unit of energy deficit). To address this possibility, we systematically searched MEDLINE, PreMEDLINE, PubMed and Cinahl and reviewed adaptive responses to energy restriction in 40 publications involving humans of any age or body mass index that had undergone a diet involving intermittent energy restriction, 12 with direct comparison to continuous energy restriction. Included publications needed to measure one or more of body weight, body mass index, or body composition before and at the end of energy restriction. 31 of the 40 publications involved 'intermittent fasting' of 1-7-day periods of severe energy restriction. While intermittent fasting appears to produce similar effects to continuous energy restriction to reduce body weight, fat mass, fat-free mass and improve glucose homeostasis, and may reduce appetite, it does not appear to attenuate other adaptive responses to energy restriction or improve weight loss efficiency, albeit most of the reviewed publications were not powered to assess these outcomes. Intermittent fasting thus represents a valid--albeit apparently not superior--option to continuous energy restriction for weight loss.",

    "title": "Health effects of intermittent fasting: hormesis or harm? A systematic review.",
    "abstract": "Intermittent fasting, alternate-day fasting, and other forms of periodic caloric desistance are gaining popularity in the lay press and among animal research scientists. Whether clinical evidence exists for or is strong enough to support the use of such dietary regimens as health interventions is unclear. This review sought to identify rigorous, clinically relevant research studies that provide high-quality evidence that therapeutic fasting regimens are clinically beneficial to humans. A systematic review of the published literature through January 2015 was performed by using sensitive search strategies to identify randomized controlled clinical trials that evaluated the effects of fasting on either clinically relevant surrogate outcomes (e.g., weight, cholesterol) or actual clinical event endpoints [e.g., diabetes, coronary artery disease (CAD)] and any other studies that evaluated the effects of fasting on clinical event outcomes. Three randomized controlled clinical trials of fasting in humans were identified, and the results were published in 5 articles, all of which evaluated the effects of fasting on surrogate outcomes. Improvements in weight and other risk-related outcomes were found in the 3 trials. Two observational clinical outcomes studies in humans were found in which fasting was associated with a lower prevalence of CAD or diabetes diagnosis. No randomized controlled trials of fasting for clinical outcomes were identified. Clinical research studies of fasting with robust designs and high levels of clinical evidence are sparse in the literature. Whereas the few randomized controlled trials and observational clinical outcomes studies support the existence of a health benefit from fasting, substantial further research in humans is needed before the use of fasting as a health intervention can be recommended.",

    "abstract": "Adolescent obesity has become a growing global health concern, contributing to the early development of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. This study aimed to evaluate the comprehensive effects of aerobic training combined with dietary intervention on anthropometric indices, body composition, and functional outcomes in obese adolescents. This retrospective study analyzed adolescents with obesity who received treatment between January 2021 and December 2024. A total of 129 adolescents with obesity who received treatment between January 2021 and December 2024 were retrospectively analyzed. Participants were assigned to a control group (aerobic exercise only, n = 61) or an observation group (aerobic exercise combined with nutritional intervention, n = 68). Both groups underwent a 12-week structured exercise program, while the observation group additionally received individualized nutritional guidance tailored to caloric needs and macronutrient balance. Anthropometric parameters, body composition, cardiopulmonary function, and physical fitness were assessed before and after the intervention. After 12 weeks, the observation group demonstrated significantly greater reductions in body mass index, waist circumference, body fat percentage, and visceral fat area compared with the control group (all P < .01). In addition, lean body mass, step test performance, vital capacity, and multiple measures of physical fitness, including muscular endurance, flexibility, and agility, showed more pronounced improvement in the observation group. These findings indicate that the combination of aerobic exercise and dietary intervention produces synergistic benefits, resulting in more effective reductions in adiposity and enhanced cardiopulmonary and physical performance. However, the retrospective and non-randomized design may limit the interpretation of causality. Integrating structured nutritional management with exercise training may represent an optimal, non-pharmacological strategy for the prevention and treatment of adolescent obesity.",

The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility, adherence, and acceptability of a 4-week ICARB protocol in free-living adults without prescribed energy restriction. Healthy adults aged 19-65 years with a BMI of 19-39 kg/m² who were weight-stable, not following a restrictive diet, and free from diagnosed medical conditions were recruited. Exclusion criteria included high physical activity ( > 3 sessions/week), use of weight-altering medications, pregnancy or breastfeeding, and indicators of disordered eating or poor sleep quality. Participants followed a 4-week ICARB protocol, limiting carbohydrate intake to ≤ 50 g on two non-consecutive days per week while maintaining unrestricted intake on the remaining days. Participant perceptions were evaluated through qualitative exit interviews whilst changes in dietary intake, body weight, adiposity, resting energy expenditure (REE), and fasted respiratory quotient (RQ) were also measured.

    "title": "Understanding insulin resistance in osteosarcopenic obesity: Therapeutic approaches for prevention and management.",
    "abstract": "Osteosarcopenic obesity (OSO) is a multifaceted condition in which obesity is present along with reduction in bone and muscle mass. The coexistence of these conditions increases the risk of fractures, physical disability and insulin resistance. This article explains the mechanism of insulin resistance in individuals with OSO highlighting the role of adipokines, lipid metabolites, pro inflammatory cells like Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha, Interluekin-6, Interleukin-1 in causing the defective insulin signaling and exacerbating insulin resistance. The pathophysiology involves muscle atrophy and bone loss exacerbated by insulin resistance. Life style interventions like low resistance exercise and intake of diet full of nutrients especially proteins can be helpful in preventing this condition. A combination therapy of resistance trainings and protein rich diet can be considered as effective approach in combating OSO and improving insulin signaling. This article accentuates the importance of lifestyle and dietetic alterations in addressing OSO and its associated metabolic and hormonal disturbances. The article mainly discusses about osteosarcopenic obesity (OSO). OSO is characterised by simultaneous deterioration of bone, muscle and excess fat which leads to decreased capabilities. A person who is diagnosed with OSO, automatically increases his/her susceptibility of having fractures, physical disability and insulin resistance. The article also includes the aetiology of OSO which includes chronic inflammation, adipokines dysregulation and abnormal insulin regulation. Proper Protein intake and resistance training if done on consistent basis can reduce muscle loss and improves insulin sensitivity. Hormonal and metabolic dysregulation are also linked to cause OSO. The synergist effect of a good dietary intake and resistance exercises are believed to provide cure for OSO to a longer extent.",

The expert panel recommends adopting at least one anthropometric index of abdominal visceral fat distribution beyond body mass index (BMI) for better clinical risk stratification. A structured lifestyle intervention (i.e., medical-nutritional treatment-MNT), preferably based on cognitive-behavioural therapeutic approach and including physical activity and a balanced diet, should be offered to all subjects living with obesity. Pharmacological or surgical treatment should be offered in addition to MNT when MNT is unable to reach clinical goals.

    "abstract": "Very Low Calorie Diet (VLCD) is a stringent caloric restriction regimen used in the short-term management of obese patients, which can effectively reduce body weight and blood glucose levels. This prospective study aimed to evaluate the short-term impacts of a VLCD on body composition, metabolic parameters, and oral microbiota in obese adults, exploring its therapeutic potential for metabolic dysfunction and inflammation-related comorbidities. This prospective study was conducted on the basis of a cohort of overweight/obese individuals at Affiliated Hospital of Hubei University of Chinese Medicine. Patient eligibility for inclusion in this study was determined by the adoption of a complete short-term VLCD therapy following their entry into the cohort. The study aimed to explore the improvements in body composition, blood glucose, blood lipids, and inflammatory markers post-VLCD intervention, as well as the safety of the treatment. Additionally, it analyzed the changes in the microbiota of the upper gastrointestinal tract, specifically the oral coating. The study was concluded on December 31, 2023. In the per-protocol cohort (n = 101), the VLCD intervention induced rapid, clinically meaningful reductions in body weight, body fat mass(BFM), body mass index (BMI), and visceral fat area(VFA). Skeletal muscle mass(SMM) decreased modestly. Metabolic parameters improved significantly, with decreases in fasting blood glucose (FBG), fasting insulin (FIns), and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). Lipid profiles showed transient increases in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and total cholesterol (CHOL) at day 5, normalizing by two-week follow-up, alongside reduced triglycerides (TG). Systemic inflammation markers declined after resuming normal diet, including alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP); uric acid (UA) peaked transiently during the VLCD before falling below baseline. Tongue-coating microbiota exhibited increased Shannon diversity and shifted community structure, with 12 reduced species associated with 19 systemic diseases. The VLCD intervention shows significant short-term benefits in weight loss and body fat reduction. Furthermore, it shows potential for reducing the risk of chronic diseases by modulating systemic inflammation and altering the oral microbiome. Further studies are warranted to assess long-term efficacy and sustainability.

    "title": "Dietary and Nutrition Interventions for Breast Cancer Survivors: An Umbrella Review.",
    "abstract": "Breast cancer is the most common malignancy among women globally, with survival rates improving due to earlier detection and better treatment. As a result, cancer survivors now constitute a growing segment of the population, and addressing their long-term health and well-being is a public health priority. Diet and nutrition represent modifiable factors that may influence recurrence, comorbidities, and quality of life (QoL), yet clear evidence-based guidance remains limited. This umbrella review thus synthesized evidence from published reviews on the effects of dietary and nutrition interventions among breast cancer survivors. Following a prospectively registered protocol in PROSPERO (CRD420251185022), six databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO and CINAHL) were systematically searched for systematic reviews/meta-analyses evaluating dietary or nutrition interventions in adult breast cancer survivors. Eligible reviews reported anthropometric, metabolic, psychosocial, or survival outcomes. Methodological quality was appraised using the AMSTAR-2 tool, and findings were narratively synthesized. Nine systematic reviews encompassing more than 10,000 breast cancer survivors were included. Interventions ranged from general dietary counselling and structured weight-management programmes to Mediterranean-style dietary patterns, dietitian-led primary care, multiple health behaviour change interventions, mobile nutrition apps, and broader lifestyle programmes incorporating diet. Across reviews, interventions consistently improved diet quality and fruit-vegetable intake, produced modest but meaningful reductions in weight, body mass index, and body fat, and enhanced several QoL domains (e.g., fatigue, physical functioning, body image). Higher adherence to Mediterranean-style diets was associated with lower all-cause and non-breast cancer mortality, though certainty was limited by observational designs. However, evidence for long-term maintenance, survival endpoints, and ethnically diverse or low- and middle-income populations remains sparse. Dietary and nutrition interventions, particularly structured, dietitian-supported, and Mediterranean-style approaches, contribute to improved diet quality, sustainable weight control, and enhanced QoL among breast cancer survivors. Integrating nutrition care into survivorship pathways should be the focus of future research.",

    "title": "Tirzepatide reduces intracellular lipid content by promoting the browning of white fat via the cAMP signaling pathway.",
    "abstract": "Tirzepatide is well known for its glucose-lowering and weight-reducing effects, primarily through central appetite suppression. However, its direct role in promoting white adipose tissue (WAT) browning and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We investigated Tirzepatide's direct effects on WAT in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice. RNA sequencing was performed to assess transcriptional changes in WAT. In vitro, differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with Tirzepatide, with or without the adenylyl cyclase inhibitor SQ22536, to explore the involvement of cAMP-dependent signaling. Tirzepatide significantly reduced body weight as well as perirenal white adipose tissue (prWAT) and inguinal white adipose tissue (ingWAT) mass, accompanied by a marked reduction in adipocyte hypertrophy in obese mice. Transcriptomic analysis revealed a coordinated upregulation of gene programs involved in thermogenesis and lipid metabolism. These molecular changes were confirmed by immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry, which showed increased expression of browning markers, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α) and uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), indicating a phenotypic shift of WAT toward a thermogenic state. In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, Tirzepatide activated the PGC-1α/UCP1 signaling axis in a cAMP-dependent manner, promoting white fat browning and reducing lipid droplet accumulation. The presence of SQ22536 attenuated these effects, highlighting cAMP signaling as a critical mediator of Tirzepatide's action. Collectively, these results demonstrate that Tirzepatide induces WAT browning via activation of the cAMP-PGC-1α-UCP1 signaling axis, leading to decreased lipid storage. These findings reveal a direct, adipocyte-intrinsic mechanism of action that extends Tirzepatide's therapeutic potential beyond its established effects on central appetite regulation.",

To evaluate the effects of LC diets (≤ 44% of total daily caloric intake [TDCI] from carbohydrate) versus HC diets (≥ 45% TDCI) on fasting glycaemia, insulinaemia, blood lipids, and body composition in non-medicated, disease-free adults under energy-matched conditions. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were identified through systematic searches of PubMed and secondary sources up to April 2025. Eligible studies compared energy-matched dietary interventions and reported pre- and post-intervention data for fasting blood glucose (FBG), fasting insulin (FINS), blood lipids (total cholesterol [TC], HDL-cholesterol [HDL-C], LDL-cholesterol [LDL-C], triglycerides [TAG]), and/or body composition. Pooled effect sizes (Hedges' g) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a random-effects model. Eighteen RCTs involving 905 participants met the inclusion criteria. LC diets produced greater reductions in FBG (g = - 0.364; 95% CI - 0.709 to - 0.019; P < 0.001) and FINS (g = - 0.190; 95% CI - 0.361 to - 0.014; P = 0.034) compared with HC. TAG decreased (g = - 0.379; 95% CI - 0.540 to - 0.219; P < 0.001), and HDL-C increased (g = 0.389; 95% CI 0.229 to 0.550; P < 0.001) under LC diets. HC diets led to a greater reduction in LDL-C (g = -  0.225; 95% CI - 0.406 to - 0.043; P = 0.009). No significant effects were found for TC. LC diets also reduced body mass (g = - 0.183; 95% CI - 0.349 to - 0.017; P = 0.031) and fat mass (g = - 0.304; 95% CI -  0.548 to - 0.059; P = 0.015) to a greater extent than HC, with no effect on fat-free mass. Under energy-matched conditions, LC confers modest advantages for glycaemia, HDL-C, and TAG, whereas HC better lowers LDL-C. Most effects do not depend on exercise status, offering evidence to guide carbohydrate intake recommendations in diets where total caloric intake remains unchanged.",

    "abstract": "A modest weight loss of ≥5 % among patients with obesity is associated with a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and other obesity-related complications. Dietary interventions play a central role in obesity management and improving metabolic health, yet region-specific data from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) remains limited. This retrospective chart review aims to assess effectiveness of dietary intervention on weight loss outcomes in patients with overweight and obesity attending a Center of Excellence for Weight Reduction and Obesity Management in UAE. This study included adult patients with BMI ≥25 kg/m A total of 266 patients (mean age 44.46 ± 8.18 years; 63.9 % female) were included. Following the intervention, participants achieved significant mean weight loss of 5.12 % (p < 0.001), with corresponding reductions in BMI (4.93 %, p < 0.001), fat mass (10.11 %, p < 0.001), and visceral fat (34.34 %, p = 0.014). More frequent sessions and longer follow-up durations were significantly associated with greater improvements in BMI, fat mass, and fat percentage. Gender-based analysis revealed that males experienced greater reductions in fat mass and resting energy expenditure compared to females. The dietary intervention resulted in significant improvements in anthropometric and body composition indices. These findings support the efficacy of individualized, dietitian-led interventions in managing obesity. The observed gender differences highlight the importance of tailored approaches in obesity care. This study contributes to the limited body of evidence on effective, non-pharmacological obesity management strategies in UAE.",

    "abstract": "The global rise in obesity and its associated metabolic complications underscores the urgent need for safe and effective interventions. This study investigated the anti-obesity efficacy of a probiotic mixture containing Bifidobacterium breve BR3 and Lactiplantibacillus plantarum LP3 in C57BL/6 mice with high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity. After obesity was established by feeding a 60% kcal HFD, the probiotic mixture was administered orally for 4 weeks. Compared with the control group, mice receiving the L. plantarum LP3 and B. breve BR3 mixture exhibited significant reductions in body weight and total fat mass, as assessed by Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) and Echo Magnetic Resonance Imaging (EchoMRI). The probiotic treatment also lowered serum Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST), Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT), and glucose levels, and attenuated lipid accumulation in both hepatic and epididymal adipose tissues. Transcriptomic profiling revealed upregulation of lipolytic genes (Sirt1, Pparα) and downregulation of lipogenic genes (Srebp1c, Fas), suggesting that the probiotic mixture promotes lipid catabolism while suppressing lipid synthesis. Additionally, serum adipokine levels were favorably modulated, indicating improved metabolic homeostasis. Gut microbiota analysis demonstrated an increased relative abundance of beneficial genera, including Akkermansia and Bacteroides, highlighting a microbiome-mediated contribution to the observed metabolic benefits. Overall, our findings indicate that the combined administration of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum LP3 and Bifidobacterium breve BR3 exerts multi-faceted anti-obesity effects by enhancing lipolysis, regulating lipid metabolism, and restoring a healthy gut microbial balance. This probiotic mixture represents a promising therapeutic approach for managing obesity and related metabolic disorders.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer recurrence risk is strongly influenced by metabolic and hormonal factors linked to adiposity and diet. The DIet ANd Androgens-5 (DIANA-5) randomized controlled trial was primarily designed to test whether adherence to a Mediterranean/macrobiotic diet, combined with moderate physical activity, could reduce the risk of breast cancer recurrence. In the present secondary analysis of the DIANA-5 trial, we investigated associations between dietary intake, anthropometric, metabolic and hormonal profile testing the hypothesis that improvement in metabolic and hormonal parameters after one year of intervention are mediated by increased consumption of recommended foods (\"recommended food score\") and changes of body composition measures. A total of 1542 women with early-stage breast cancer and presence of one or more endocrine/metabolic risk factors were randomized to receive either standard healthy lifestyle recommendations (n = 773) or intensive support including dietary counseling, cooking classes, and moderate physical activity reinforcement (n = 769). Anthropometric (BMI, waist circumference [WC], fat mass/fat-free mass ratio [FM/FFM]), metabolic (glycemia, insulin, HOMA index, total cholesterol, triglycerides, metabolic syndrome), and hormonal (testosterone) endpoints were assessed at baseline and after 12 months. Potential mediation effects of \"recommended food score\" and WC or FM/FFM on metabolic and hormonal changes were tested by using SPSS version 23 and the PROCESS macro v.4.0 for SPSS. 604 and 551 women were available for mediation analyses in intervention and control groups, respectively. The dietary intervention improved all anthropometric, metabolic and hormonal measures. \"Recommended food score\" together with WC mediated 73 % of the effect of the intervention on glycemia, 67 % on insulin, 70 % on HOMA index, 96 % on total cholesterol, and 86 % on metabolic syndrome. With \"recommended food score\" and FM/FFM as mediators, proportions mediated were 86 % for glycemia, 73 % for insulin, 78 % for HOMA index, 126 % for total cholesterol, and 66 % for metabolic syndrome. Mediation effects of WC and FM/FFM on triglyceride changes were much weaker (38 % and 37 %, respectively). For all outcomes and all mediators, at least one path had a p-value <0.05. Most benefits of the DIANA-5 lifestyle intervention were mediated by dietary adherence and reductions in WC and FM/FFM. The proportion of effects mediated on metabolic syndrome, glucose and glycemic tolerance is high enough to suggest that these are the main effectors. The results on triglyceride blood levels suggest that further mechanism, possibly physical activity and energy intake should be investigated. NCT05019989.

The primary aim was to evaluate the effects of ketogenic phase of VLEKT on MASLD and the secondary aim was to identify the underlying mechanisms in women with obesity. This prospective outpatient study included 80 women with obesity (mean age 39.25 ± 4.89 years; BMI 37.27 ± 4.58 kg/m2) and MASLD (FLI ≥ 60) who followed ketogenic phase of VLEKT (< 800 kcal/day, with macronutrient composition comprising 13% carbohydrates, 43% proteins and 44% fats at the University Hospital Federico II of Naples. Assessments at baseline and after ketogenic phase of VLEKT included anthropometric measurements, body composition (via bioelectrical impedance analysis), biochemical analyses, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels and the Fatty Liver Index (FLI). After ketogenic phase, significant reductions were observed in BMI, waist circumference, fat mass, total and LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, gamma-glutamyl transferase (γGT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), fasting plasma glucose and Hs-CRP levels (p < 0.001, for all). Weight loss (%Δ weight) showed significant positive correlations with %Δ fat mass (p < 0.001), %Δ total cholesterol (p < 0.001), %Δ LDL cholesterol (p < 0.001), and %Δ γGT (p < 0.001), while %Δ HDL cholesterol showed a significant negative correlation (p < 0.001). Multiple regression analysis identified %Δ hs-CRP as the main predictor of MASLD improvement, explaining 65.9% of the variance (p < 0.001). MASLD improved post-ketogenic-phase of VLEKT in women with obesity, primarily via reduced chronic inflammation.",

Inhibition of a phenotype switch to macrophage-like cells is a promising strategy to prevent atherosclerosis (AS), and targeted nanotherapeutics represent one approach for implementing this strategy. To this end, we designed immunosuppressive oligodeoxynucleotide A151 functionalized selenium nanoparticles with a spearhead LacNAc (LN-A151-SeNPs) that target macrophage-like VSMCs. Nano characterization showed that the uniformity and stability of nanoparticles were optimized by modification with LacNAc and A151, resulting in an average diameter of 88.90 ± 1.45 nm, Zeta potentials of -21.1 ± 1.5 mV, a A151:Se molar ratio of 1:60 and mass ratio of 1.68:1.

    "abstract": "Intermittent fasting (IF) has gained attention as a potential intervention for cardiometabolic health, though its long-term effects remain unclear. In this randomized clinical trial, we assessed the impact of 6 months of IF on body composition, cardiovascular risk factors, and related molecular pathways in middle-aged (30-65 years) men and women with overweight (BMI 24.8-35 kg/m²). In this trial, 41 participants were randomized to either an intermittent fasting (IF) intervention or to maintain their habitual diet. The primary outcome (circulating CRP concentration) was previously reported; here, we present exploratory analyses focusing on metabolomic and transcriptomic responses. IF led to an 8% reduction in body weight, a 16% decrease in body fat, and significant improvements in lipid profile, including substantial reductions in plasma LDL-cholesterol, non-HDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides (p = 0.001). However, no significant changes were observed in other cardiometabolic risk factors. To investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms, we performed untargeted plasma metabolomics and transcriptomic analysis of colon mucosa biopsies. Significant multi-omic changes were identified, particularly in lipid metabolism, bile acid signaling, and enteroendocrine regulation. Notably, there was a downregulation of transcripts related to glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and related enteroendocrine hormones. Correlation analysis highlighted key molecular pathways, with PPAR-α and B-cell-mediated immune processes significantly associated with changes in non-HDL cholesterol. Our findings extend the understanding of IF in humans beyond weight loss, providing key mechanistic insights to inform targeted therapies for improving cardiometabolic health.

    "abstract": "Childhood overweight and obesity are growing public health concerns, leading to metabolic consequences such as increased body mass index, larger waist circumference, and excess body fat. Multi-component school interventions that address both the obesogenic environment and individual behaviors have been recommended, but their effectiveness remains uncertain. This review and meta-analysis, conducted following PRISMA guidelines, examined the impact of multi-component interventions - including modifications to the school food environment - on adiposity and food consumption among children and adolescents. A search on MEDLINE, SciELO, CENTRAL, Clinical Trials, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science identified 51 eligible studies. The meta-analysis showed a small but significant reduction in waist circumference (MD: -0.70cm; 95%CI: -1.22, -0.19; I2 = 40%). Interventions were also linked to lower intake of unhealthy foods, total energy, total fat, saturated fat, and increased vegetable consumption. However, no consistent effects were observed for body mass index or body fat percentage. Study quality varied, and intervention designs and implementation strategies were heterogeneous; thus, results should be interpreted cautiously. These findings suggest that while school food environment interventions can improve some dietary behaviors and adiposity indicators, their effectiveness in preventing obesity remains inconclusive. Strengthening policies and ensuring long-term, structured interventions are crucial for meaningful and sustained health improvements in school settings.

    "title": "ENT1 inhibition enhances weight control and metabolic health in diet-induced obesity.",
    "abstract": "To identify novel targets to treat obesity, we focused on the equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (ENT1), which is a key regulator of extracellular adenosine levels in adipose tissue. Adenosine has been shown to control multiple aspects of metabolic homeostasis through P1 purinergic receptors (mainly A1, A2A, and A2B receptors) that belong to the family of G protein coupled receptors. Prior studies showed that ENT1 deletion in adipose tissue protects mice from diet-induced obesity. Herein, we explored whether pharmacological ENT1 inhibition could offer a novel therapeutic approach for obesity. We assessed EOS-518, a newly developed selective ENT1 inhibitor, in vitro and in vivo using a diet-induced obesity (DIO) mouse model, comparing its efficacy to incretin mimetics, namely semaglutide. In DIO mice, EOS-518 treatment led to marked reductions in body weight, food intake, fat mass, cholesterol, glucose, and insulin levels. ENT1 inhibition preserved VO₂ consumption, promoted fatty acid oxidation, and decreased inflammatory markers such as IFNγ response and TNFα in white adipose tissue. Notably, combining EOS-518 with semaglutide produced greater weight loss than either agent alone, indicating a synergistic effect between ENT1 inhibition and GLP-1 receptor agonism. Furthermore, initiating EOS-518 after semaglutide-induced weight loss plateau resulted in a significantly lower final body weight compared to semaglutide monotherapy. EOS-518 promotes weight loss, improves metabolic parameters, restores adipose tissue function, and reduces inflammation in DIO mice. Altogether, this study positions ENT1 as a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of obesity and associated metabolic disorders.",

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a genetic disorder resulting from the absence of paternal 15q11-q13 alleles and is clinically characterised by pathological obesity, delayed satiety, hyperphagia, decreased muscle mass, and increased fat mass. Dietary management constitutes a key component in the prevention and treatment of obesity in individuals with PWS. This scoping study aimed to identify dietary interventions available for treating obesity among PWS individuals. A systematic search using the six stages of the scoping review methodology proposed by Arksey and O'Malley was conducted across four databases: PubMed, Scopus, EBSCOhost, and Cochrane Library. The inclusion criteria were full-text research articles published in English between 2017 and 2023, involving human participants with PWS, and reporting on dietary interventions for obesity management. Out of 100 articles retrieved, five studies were identified. Two studies described multidisciplinary programs integrating dietary and physical activity components, while three focused exclusively on dietary interventions. The outcomes varied by intervention and study design. Ketogenic diets and multidisciplinary programs with exercise often resulted in favourable weight and body fat reduction. However, strict diets like the modified Atkins faced adherence challenges and frequent weight regain. Multidisciplinary, supervised programs result in higher adherence and more effective weight management, with body mass index near normal. In conclusion, although research in this area remains limited, current evidence suggests that both dietary and multidisciplinary interventions have the potential to support obesity management in individuals with PWS.",

    "abstract": "Obesity and its associated metabolic disturbances remain a growing public health concern, highlighting the need for effective and sustainable dietary strategies. This randomized controlled trial aimed to compare the effects of four plant-based dietary patterns: vegan (VG), lacto-ovo-vegetarian (LOV), Mediterranean (MD), and the EAT-Lancet Planetary Health Diet (EAT) with a control diet based on WHO recommendations (CTRL) in reducing body weight and improving selected metabolic and behavioral parameters in overweight and obese adults. A total of 90 participants (aged 18-64) were methodically assigned to one of five distinct dietary groups for a period of 12 weeks. The primary outcome measured was the change in body weight. Secondary outcomes encompassed body composition, waist circumference, energy and macronutrient intake, fasting plasma glucose and insulin levels, arterial blood pressure, plasma lipid profile, appetitive traits, physical activity, and quality of life. A total of 85 subjects completed the intervention. All plant-based diets resulted in a reduction of body weight, waist circumference, fat mass, and energy intake in comparison to the control group. The most pronounced body weight reductions were observed after 12 weeks in the VG group (-6.7%) and the EAT group (-5.6%) ( Among plant-based dietary patterns differing in animal product content, the EAT and VG diets demonstrated the most pronounced effects on weight and body composition. These findings provide support for the notion that structured, plant-based dietary interventions can be effective strategies for managing body weight.",

    "abstract": "The present study sought to elucidate the potentiality of oil extracted from Opisthopterus tardoore (OT, marine fish available in Bay of Bengal region) on diet induced obesity and explored into the primary molecular process that underlies these effects. Male Swiss albino mice were fed a high-fat diet for 12 weeks to develop obesity, and different doses of OT (200, 400, and 600 mg/kg/day) oil was administered orally for 4 weeks. Following treatment, body weight, biochemical, histological, and genomic parameters were assessed from liver and adipose tissues (ATs). Significant reductions were observed in body weight, lipid profiles, blood glucose, liver, and visceral AT weight, correlated with decreased adipocyte size by supplementation with OT oil. The fish oil significantly upregulates mRNA levels of lipolytic factors such as adiponectin, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α, carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1, lipoprotein lipase, and antiinflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), IL-10, than those of high-fat diet group. Concomitantly, adipogenesis and fatty acid synthesis were arrested by reduction of lipogenic genes, including leptin, fatty acid synthase, sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c, and proinflammatory markers (tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-6, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and IL-1β) in adipocytes. The results therefore concluded that OT oil exhibited lipid-lowering along with antiinflammatory properties.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is increasingly prevalent among older adults and is a major contributor to cardiometabolic diseases, functional decline, frailty, and loss of independence. The intersection between population ageing and the obesity epidemic poses major public health and clinical challenges. This European Association for the Study of Obesity (EASO) position statement represents an update of the EASO guideline from 2012, and provides a comprehensive overview of the epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical consequences, and management of obesity in adults aged ≥65 years. It summarizes current evidence and offers practical recommendations for diagnosis and treatment tailored to this age group. To guide clinicians and researchers through this updated framework, the position statement highlights four central concepts that underpin obesity assessment and management in later life: (1) obesity affects up to one-third of older adults globally, with prevalence varying by sex and geography; (2) ageing is associated with changes in body composition, hormonal milieu, and lifestyle factors (diet, physical inactivity, and polypharmacy) that favour fat accumulation and sarcopenic obesity; (3) body mass index alone is insufficient; assessment should include body composition analysis (including fat distribution and muscle mass), psychological status, and functional performance; (4) a multimodal approach is recommended, including moderate energy restriction with adequate protein intake, structured multicomponent exercise, behavioural support, and, where appropriate, obesity management medications and/or metabolic bariatric surgery. The focus should be on preserving muscle mass, functional capacity, and quality of life, rather than weight loss alone. Effective management of obesity in older adults should focus on individualized, multidisciplinary strategies that balance the benefits of weight reduction against the risks of sarcopenia, malnutrition, and loss of independence.",

This study investigated whether exogenous β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) supplementation, as an adjunct to a hypocaloric diet, improves body composition and metabolic markers in overweight and obese adults by preferentially reducing fat mass while preserving lean mass. In this 8-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 51 adults were assigned to receive either racemic BHB mineral salts or placebo (maltodextrin) twice daily, alongside modest caloric restriction. Assessments at baseline and week 8 included dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry for body composition, indirect calorimetry for resting metabolic rate (RMR), and venous blood analyses for cardiometabolic biomarkers (e.g., lipids, HOMA-IR, uric acid, liver enzymes). Body mass decreased in both groups over the intervention ( Exogenous BHB supplementation may enhance the quality of diet-induced weight loss through within-group improvements in fat mass reduction and lean mass preservation, with no adverse metabolic impacts.",

    "abstract": "Obesity and atherogenic dyslipidemias are interrelated disorders that substantially contribute to the development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and the broader cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic (CKM) syndrome. The heterogeneity of obesity, particularly the role of visceral, ectopic and dysfunctional adipose tissue, drives the dyslipidemia phenotype characterized by hypertriglyceridemia, reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and elevated apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins. We review the epidemiological studies, imaging analyses, genetic data and clinical trial evidence linking obesity phenotypes with dyslipidemias and cardiovascular outcomes. We further evaluated lifestyle, pharmacological and surgical strategies targeting obesity-related lipid abnormalities. Visceral and ectopic fat accumulation, rather than body mass index alone, strongly predicts adverse lipid patterns, insulin resistance and cardiovascular events. Atherogenic dyslipidemias contribute to substantial residual ASCVD risk despite low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering. Lifestyle interventions-including diet modification, physical activity and improved cardiorespiratory fitness-demonstrate favourable effects on lipid metabolism independent of weight loss. Traditional pharmacotherapies such as statins, fibrates and omega-3 fatty acids offer partial benefits, while novel incretin-based agents and dual or triple receptor agonists provide robust weight loss and metabolic improvements. Metabolic and bariatric surgery remains an effective approach for sustained weight reduction and remission of dyslipidemias in the appropriate patient and is increasingly integrated with pharmacotherapy. Atherogenic dyslipidemias are a hallmark of high-risk obesity phenotypes and a major contributor to ASCVD within the CKM framework. Precision medicine approaches that incorporate obesity phenotyping, targeted treatment strategies and population-level interventions are needed to reduce the burden of dyslipidemias and their cardiovascular sequelae.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) can progress to steatohepatitis (MASH), which is closely associated with obesity and insulin resistance. Resmetirom, and semaglutide, have been shown to have therapeutic effects in clinical studies. We compared these mechanisms in western diet (WD)-fed melanocortin 4 receptor knockout (MC4R-KO) mice, a human MASH pathology model. Male MC4R-KO mice were fed WD for 6 weeks starting from 22 weeks of age for disease induction and were administered drugs for 7 weeks with WD feeding, for a total duration of 13 weeks. Both resmetirom and semaglutide treatments for 7 weeks substantially improved these parameters. Although resmetirome and semaglutide improved liver hydroxyproline deposition and total fat mass, semaglutide markedly suppressed total lean mass. Moreover, resmetirom enhanced oxygen consumption, whereas semaglutide reduced energy expenditure. Histopathological evaluation showed that resmetirom significantly and semaglutide tended to improve liver steatosis score. On the fibrosis score, semaglutide significantly reduced it. Resmetirom and semaglutide have different mechanisms of action against MASH. Similar to clinical evidence, semaglutide treatment, might cause muscle mass reduction due to food intake suppression. This is the first study to simultaneously compare the effects of resmetirom and semaglutide on MASH phenotypes and reveal the differences on their mechanisms of action in WD-fed MC4R-KO mice.",

    "abstract": "Current anti-obesity therapies that suppress appetite often cause undesirable reductions in lean mass by indirectly depleting systemic energy store. In this study, we developed a novel anti-obesity drug, Vutiglabridin (VUTI), designed to selectively reduce fat mass while preserving lean mass. We evaluated its efficacy in high-fat diet-induced obese (DIO) mice and investigated its underlying mechanism in in vitro adipocyte models. VUTI dose-dependently and selectively decreased fat mass, resulting in normalization of body weight within 3 weeks while preserving lean mass. Pharmacokinetic and mechanistic analyses revealed that VUTI targets white adipose tissue (WAT), where it enhances lipid degradation through AMPK-mediated lipophagy in both mouse and human adipocytes. The lipid degradation-enhancing effect of VUTI was shown to be dependent on paraoxonase 2 (PON2). Multi-omics analyses, including proteomic and transcriptomic profiling of epididymal WAT in DIO-mice, further confirmed this mechanism. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that VUTI represents a promising therapeutic strategy for obesity by inducing fat-selective reduction via AMPK-mediated lipophagy.",

    "abstract": "This randomized controlled trial compared the effects of regional, general, and combined aerobic training on plasma lipolytic markers and subcutaneous fat reduction in obese women with abdominal or gluteofemoral fat accumulation. Sixty women (age 25-50 years; BMI ≥30 kg/m²) were assigned to general aerobic training (GATG; treadmill/cycling), regional aerobic training (RTG; targeted abdominal or lower-body rhythmic exercises), or combined training (CTG; 15 min general + 15 min regional), performed three times per week for 12 weeks at 55-75% heart rate reserve. Dietary intake was monitored to ensure no major changes. Anthropometric indices (weight, BMI, waist-to-hip ratio [WHR]) and plasma free fatty acids (FFAs), glycerol, and insulin were measured pre- and post-intervention. All groups demonstrated significant reductions in weight, BMI, WHR, and biochemical markers (p<0.05). The CTG achieved the greatest improvements: weight -6.38%, BMI -6.30%, WHR -13.13%, accompanied by the largest declines in FFAs, glycerol, and insulin. GATG showed superior systemic fat loss compared to RTG, but RTG still produced notable WHR and insulin reductions, suggesting a complementary role for localized exercise. The superior outcomes in CTG may reflect synergistic effects of global cardiovascular activation and targeted regional muscle engagement, potentially enhancing both systemic lipolysis and local adipose tissue responsiveness. Biochemical improvements, particularly reductions in fasting FFAs and glycerol, indicate enhanced adipocyte insulin sensitivity and lipid utilization. The pronounced insulin decline in CTG is clinically relevant for metabolic risk reduction. While \"spot reduction\" remains controversial, these findings support integrating regional movements within broader aerobic programs to address resistant fat depots. This study suggests that combining general and regional aerobic training offers a practical, scalable approach for improving metabolic health and body composition in obese women. Future research should employ imaging-based fat quantification, hormonal profiling, and long-term follow-up to clarify underlying mechanisms and optimize depot-specific exercise prescriptions.",

    "title": "Effect of Vitamin D Supplementation on Oxidative Stress Biomarkers in Women Following Religious or Intermittent Fasting Patterns.",
    "abstract": "Vitamin D supplementation may influence oxidative stress, but evidence in populations following specific dietary patterns is limited. In this non-randomized, two-group exploratory study, 50 Orthodox nuns received vitamin D supplementation (2000 IU/day orally) for 16 weeks, whereas 50 age-matched women following time-restricted eating (TRE) served as controls receiving no supplementation. Anthropometric parameters, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], and oxidative stress markers-total antioxidant capacity (TAC), glutathione (GSH), and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances-were measured at baseline and post-intervention. At baseline, both groups were comparable in anthropometric and oxidative stress markers, except for serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], which was lower in the intervention group. Following supplementation, serum 25(OH)D increased from 15.77 ± 5.21 to 31.24 ± 7.87 ng/mL ( In conclusion, sixteen weeks of vitamin D supplementation in women adhering to Orthodox fasting produced no consistent improvements in oxidative stress markers. While a small reduction in TBARS was observed, this effect was modest and appeared indirect, being more closely associated with decreases in body weight and fat mass than with vitamin D status itself. Taken together, our findings indicate an overall neutral impact of vitamin D on redox balance, suggesting that any antioxidant benefit is likely secondary to metabolic or adiposity-related changes.",

    "abstract": "Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune and inflammatory disease of the central nervous system, and recent evidence suggests a potential role for gluten in its pathogenesis. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of a gluten-free diet (GFD) on disease-related disability, anthropometric parameters, and serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels in patients with Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS). Fifty-four female RRMS patients were followed for six months. The GFD group (n = 27) adhered to a structured gluten-free diet, while the gluten-containing diet (GD) group (n = 27) received general healthy eating advice. Anthropometric measurements, 24-hour dietary recalls, and blood samples were collected at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. After six months, energy and carbohydrate intakes significantly decreased in the GFD group (p < 0.05), accompanied by a marked reduction in serum LPS levels (ΔLPS = -377.93 ± 975.41 vs. 207.00 ± 288.81 pg/mL; p < 0.001). The GFD group also showed significant improvement in EDSS scores (ΔEDSS = -0.24 ± 0.61 vs. 0.00 ± 0.39; p = 0.042). Body weight, BMI, waist and hip circumferences, and body fat mass decreased significantly compared with the GD group (all p < 0.05). Regression analysis identified \"group\" as a significant predictor of ΔLPS, ΔEDSS, and Δwaist circumference (p < 0.05), independent of age, disease duration, and HEI changes. A six-month gluten-free diet improved disability, reduced systemic endotoxemia, and favorably altered body composition in RRMS patients, supporting its potential as a complementary nutritional therapy in multiple sclerosis management.",

    "abstract": "As key metabolic regulators, the roles of GDF15 and FGF21 in mediating the effects of modified ketogenic diet (MKD) on weight loss and lipoprotein remodeling in obese patients require further investigation. This study enrolled 30 metabolically healthy obese participants (BMI ≥ 28 kg/m²) for a 2-week MKD intervention. Using a self-controlled pre-post design, we performed measurements including body composition analysis, fasting serum GDF15 and FGF21 levels measurement, and serum lipoprotein subclass quantification at both baseline and post-intervention time points. Following a 2-week MKD intervention, participants exhibited statistically significant reductions in body weight (96.14 ± 27.23 kg vs. 91.63 ± 26.47 kg; Δ4.8%, P < 0.001) and BMI (33.99 ± 6.08 kg/m The short-term MKD intervention significantly improved adiposity metrics while elevating GDF15 and reducing FGF21 levels.

    "title": "Impacts of minimally-processed omnivorous vs lacto-ovo-vegetarian diets on insulin sensitivity, lipid profile, and adiposity in older adults: Secondary findings from a randomized crossover feeding trial.",
    "abstract": "The aging population in the U.S. faces increased cardiometabolic risk, reducing healthspan and increasing public health burden. These vulnerabilities may be compounded by ultra-processed food (UPF). No feeding trial has evaluated UPF reduction in older adults within the framework of Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA). This study addressed the gap using representative omnivorous and lacto-ovo vegetarian patterns. The secondary outcomes of the Protein-Distinct Macronutrient-Equivalent Diet 2 (PRODMED2) trial compared two DGA-aligned, low-UPF diets with each other and with a high-UPF habitual baseline (BSL) diet in 36 community-dwelling older adults. The diets featured minimally processed pork (MPP) and lentils (MPL) as representative animal- and plant-based primary proteins, each provided for 8 weeks without calorie restriction and separated by a 2-week washout. Diet compositions and intakes, body composition, cardiometabolic biomarkers, and hormones linked to nutrient sensing and energy balance were measured before and after interventions, with a subset of measures repeated at ∼1-year post-intervention follow-up (FUP). Data were primarily analyzed using robust linear mixed-effects models adjusted for covariates. Switching from a high-UPF BSL (∼50%E) to either low-UPF diets (∼13%E), unintentionally lowered energy intake (Δ-333 vs Δ-437 kcal/d, MPP vs MPL), resulting in reductions in body weight (Δ-3.8 vs Δ-4.4 kg), and fat mass (Δ-2.6 vs Δ-2.9 kg). Both diets improved HOMA-IR, insulin, C-peptide, total cholesterol, LDL, apolipoprotein B, non-HDL, and CRP relative to BSL (all, p < 0.038 BSL vs post-diet, no significance between diets). Fasting leptin declined (Δ-1.9 vs Δ-2.5 ng/mL MPP vs MPL) and FGF21 increased (Δ+65 vs Δ+88 pg/mL MPP vs MPL) in both diet phases (all, p < 0.026 BSL vs post-diet, no significance between diets). At FUP, as UPF exposure increased to 44 %, dietary intakes, weight, adiposity, and biomarkers returned toward BSL. Results demonstrate that low-UPF eating aligns with DGA pattern and is feasible across both plant- and animal-based diets. Both omnivorous and lacto-ovo vegetarian interventions promoted caloric reduction, weight and visceral fat loss, improved insulin sensitivity and lipid metabolism, and reduced inflammatory markers. These effects may involve nutrient sensing via FGF21 and leptin. Low-UPF diets may provide a practical approach to support healthy aging. The trial is registered at www. gov as NCT05581953 on October 12, 2022.",

    "title": "Astaxanthin limits atherosclerosis and dysmetabolism in mice by attenuating inflammatory cell recruitment and signaling.",
    "abstract": "Astaxanthin (ASX) has demonstrated various cardioprotective effects, including reductions in body weight, adipose tissue mass, hypertension, myocardial infarct size, and oxidative stress markers. Despite these findings, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study examines the role of ASX in murine atherosclerosis and metabolic derangements induced by atherogenic diet, aiming to gain a deeper understanding of its biological effects and potential therapeutic applications. Ldlr-/- mice were fed a high-fat, high-cholesterol diet (HCD) for 16 weeks, receiving 70 mg/kg ASX or vehicle every other day. A week before the study ended, glucose and insulin tolerance tests were performed. Plaque size in the aorta was analyzed via histology (Oil-red-O and Masson's trichrome). Flow cytometry assessed immune cells from blood, aorta, adipose tissue, and cytokines in plasma. Additional mice underwent intravital microscopy for further investigation. The overall body weight of animals treated with ASX or vehicle did not differ. ASX-treated mice showed a reduced abundance of peripheral monocytes by 34%, lower numbers of leukocytes in adipose tissue depots, and improved glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity compared with animals receiving vehicle. White adipose mass decreased while brown adipose and muscle mass increased in mice treated with ASX. Atherosclerotic lesions of Ldlr-/- mice receiving ASX were significantly smaller and contained fewer lipids (3.3 vs 2.6 x 105 µm2) and M1 macrophages (0.97 vs 0.42x103) but increased collagen, in line with a more stable plaque phenotype. Mechanistic experiments revealed that ASX attenuated leukocyte recruitment (43% ± 1.87) to the vessel wall in intravital microscopy and dampened inflammatory signaling through Mitogen-activated protein kinases. ASX treatment reduces experimental atherosclerosis and blunts metabolic syndrome features in mice. This effect is linked to reduced leukocyte recruitment and systemic/local inflammation. The findings support ASX's potential in treating atherosclerosis and metabolic diseases, offering new mechanistic insights and ultimately warrant the rigorous clinical evaluation of such putative effects.",

The aim of this prospective interventional study was to evaluate the effects of a 16-week program combining HD with PT on ventilatory efficiency and cardiometabolic risk markers in women with MetS. Forty-one sedentary women (aged 45-55 years) with clinically diagnosed MetS underwent anthropometric, metabolic, nutritional, and cardiopulmonary assessments before and after the intervention.

We retrospectively analyzed a curated cohort of RD patients with malignant hypertension to assess factors, including dietary adherence, associated with blood pressure (BP) reduction. From 17 487 RD charts, we identified 544 malignant hypertension patients (baseline systolic BP ≥170 mm Hg and with concurrent retinal hemorrhage or papilledema), excluding those with diabetes, brain tumor, or prior sympathectomy. Outcome data were censored after any 30-day break in consecutive data. Baseline features, BP changes from baseline to week 4, and diet adherence (assessed by urinary chloride, UCl) were evaluated using summary statistics, univariate, and multivariable analyses. Most patients participated in the RD program before antihypertensive drugs were available; only 48 (8.8%) received any antihypertensive medications in the first month. The cohort (68.9% male) had a median baseline BP of 213/128 mm Hg and body mass index of 23.6 kg/m The low-sodium, low-fat, low-protein RD effectively lowered BP in malignant hypertension patients in 4 weeks, independent of antihypertensive medications.",

    "title": "A Multidisciplinary Perspective on Semaglutide Treatment and Medical Nutrition Therapy in Obesity Management.",
    "abstract": "This review explores the integration of semaglutide, a highly effective glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA), with medical nutritional therapy (MNT) for the comprehensive management of obesity. Semaglutide promotes significant weight loss and metabolic improvement, but optimal outcomes often require combining this pharmacological treatment with tailored nutritional interventions. This review focuses on two prominent dietary strategies whose nutritional profiles may complement semaglutide's mechanisms of action: the Mediterranean diet (MD) and very-low-energy ketogenic therapy (VLEKT). The MD emphasises balanced macronutrients and anti-inflammatory components, making it particularly suitable for individuals with uncomplicated obesity; it supports gradual and sustainable weight loss while mitigating inflammation and gastrointestinal side effects. Conversely, VLEKT, which induces nutritional ketosis, may be more appropriate for patients with significant cardiometabolic comorbidities, offering rapid and substantial fat mass reduction and improved glycaemic control. Both dietary approaches, when integrated with semaglutide therapy, have the potential to preserve lean body mass, reduce gastrointestinal adverse events, and enhance adherence through improved satiety and tolerability. The proposed integrated approach underscores the importance of personalised nutritional strategies guided by patient-specific metabolic, hormonal, and microbiota profiles, and calls for effective multidisciplinary collaboration among nutritionists, endocrinologists, and behavioural health professionals to optimise therapeutic outcomes. Ultimately, we emphasise that shifting the clinical focus from weight reduction alone to a targeted approach integrating semaglutide with evidence-based nutritional strategies may represent the most promising pathway towards sustainable obesity management.",

    "title": "Case series: Effects of a ketogenic diet on cardiometabolic health in seven outpatients with bipolar disorder.",
    "abstract": "Recent research suggests that the ketogenic diet (KD) has the potential to serve as an effective treatment option for neuropsychiatric disorders, targeting both dysfunctions in brain metabolism and cardiometabolic comorbidities. In many patients, KDs may ameliorate comorbidities such as obesity, metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. However, the long-term effects of KDs on cardiovascular health remain an important topic of investigation, due to considerable inter-individual variability in how KDs may impact lipid metabolism. While some studies have shown no significant change in cholesterol levels, and some have shown improvements, still others have highlighted the potential of KDs to induce or exacerbate hyperlipidemia. To shed new light on this ongoing controversy, we present both beneficial and concerning effects of a 3-month intervention with Ketogenic Metabolic Therapy (KMT) (1.5:1 ratio) on a wide range of cardiometabolic health markers in seven outpatients with bipolar disorder and comorbid dyslipidemia. Cardiometabolic assessments were based on markers of lipoprotein burden, such as apolipoprotein B (apoB), lipoprotein (a) (Lp(a)), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglyceride (TG) and total cholesterol (TC), markers of inflammation, such high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), markers of oxidative stress, such as malondialdehyde-modified LDL (MDA-LDL) and nitrotyrosine, molecules that relate to endothelial function, such as homocysteine and advanced glycation end products (AGE), and anthropometric measures, such as BMI and fat mass. Mean changes between pre-KMT and post-KMT measurements were calculated. In addition, within-person changes in outcomes of interest were visually summarized using boxplots. Beneficial cardiometabolic effects included a decrease in mean Lp(a) of 6.6 mg/dl (-21%), a reduction in mean triglyceride of 40.6 mg/dl (-30%), a reduction in mean apoB of 0.14 g/L (-10,5%) and an increase in mean HDL-C of 3 mg/dL (+5%), a reduction in mean hsCRP of 0.94 mg/L (-45%), a reduction in mean TNF-α of 1.31 pg/ml (-7%), a reduction in mean MDA-LDL of 36.77 U/L (-38%), a reduction in mean nitrotyrosine of 225 nmol/L (-28%), a mean weight reduction of 4 kg (-4,6%), a mean visceral fat reduction of 0.69% (-10%) and a mean fat mass reduction of 3.7 kg (-12%). However, some concerning effects were also observed. Of note, mean homocysteine levels increased by 1.94 umol/L (+18%) and mean AGE levels increased by 30.9 ug/ml (+106%). Moreover, mean LDL-C was increased by 14 mg/dl (+9%) and mean total cholesterol was increased by 7 mg/dl (+3%). Based on these findings, it is concluded that comprehensive Ketogenic Metabolic Therapy provided to outpatients with bipolar disorder can be beneficial in improving a broad range of cardiometabolic health markers, including lipid metabolism, inflammation, oxidative stress and anthropometric measures. Tentatively, these findings suggest that at least a proportion of patients with bipolar disorder may find remarkable improvements in cardiometabolic health adopting a metabolic treatment such as the ketogenic diet. However, potentially concerning effects on markers such as homocysteine and AGE call for well-formulated, individualized KDs.",

    "title": "The Effect of Time-Restricted Eating on Metabolic Risk Factors for Cardiovascular Disease and Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease in Overweight and Obese Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.",
    "abstract": "Time-restricted eating (TRE) is an effective dietary strategy for reducing overweight, obesity, and related complications, offering flexibility to fit individual preferences. However, its effects vary depending on individual conditions, and to date insufficient research in human studies has been conducted to support its recommendation as a healthy eating approach. This study took the form of a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the effects of TRE on overweight and obesity in adults and on metabolic risk factors, specifically cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), considering fasting window, a common intervention, intake management, and intervention duration. A literature search was conducted on October 10, 2024, using the Ovid MEDLINE, Cochrane CENTRAL, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, and CINAHL databases. The study followed the PRISMA checklist and included 28 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with 1648 participants. The outcomes analyzed included weight, waist circumference, fat mass, plasma lipids, Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR), fasting glucose, and fasting insulin. The meta-analysis showed large effect sizes (ESs) for weight (ES: -1.40, 95% CI: -2.33 to -0.48) and waist circumference (ES: -0.75, 95% CI: -0.93 to -0.56), and a moderate ES for fat mass (ES: -0.61, 95% CI: -0.98 to -0.24). A small effect was found for HOMA-IR (ES: -0.29, 95% CI: -0.48 to -0.10). While there was heterogeneity for weight and fat mass, the sensitivity analyses were robust. In contrast, the effects on plasma lipids, fasting glucose, and fasting insulin were inconclusive. TRE may ameliorate metabolic risk factors in adults with overweight and obesity, offering a flexible approach adaptable to individual lifestyles. However, reductions in weight and fat mass may depend on the individual conditions, and the medications taken by individuals may influence the outcomes. Furthermore, interventional studies on TRE remain insufficient, necessitating further experimental research, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses to better understand the effects of TRE.

    "title": "Er-Chen decoction alleviates spermatogenic dysfunction in obese mice by tuning the SIRT1/p53 axis.",
    "abstract": "Er-Chen Decoction (ECD), a classic traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula, is clinically indicated for dispelling dampness and resolving phlegm. It has been widely used in the management of phlegm‒dampness syndrome, including obesity, with a long-standing clinical application history in improving obesity-related male infertility. Although its therapeutic efficacy has been validated through long-term clinical practice, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain incompletely understood. This study aimed to investigate the molecular mechanisms by which ECD ameliorates obesity-related spermatogenic dysfunction (SD) through the SIRT1/p53 signaling axis. A mouse model of diet-induced obesity was established by feeding a high-fat diet (HFD) for 8 weeks. Subsequently, obese mice were randomly assigned to receive interventions with ECD (low-, medium-, or high-dose) or L-carnitine (positive control) for 3 weeks. Sperm functional parameters were evaluated to assess obesity-related SD. A combination of network pharmacology analysis, molecular docking, biochemical assays, hematoxylin‒eosin (HE) staining, Oil Red O staining, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT‒qPCR), immunofluorescence (IF) staining, immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, Western blotting (WB), and transcriptomic analysis was employed to dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying the protective effects of the ECD against obesity-related SD. Additionally, the bioactive components of ECD were characterized using extensive targeted mass spectrometry. Medium-dose ECD (ECD-M) significantly reduced body weight and lipid accumulation in HFD-induced obese mice. Notably, compared with the HFD group, the ECD-M group presented a 50 % reduction in the abnormal sperm percentage (p < 0.01), along with a 60 % increase in sperm concentration (p < 0.01), and showed an upward trend in both sperm progressive motility and sperm motility. Furthermore, ECD-M significantly upregulated the expression of the tight junction (TJ) proteins Occludin (p < 0.001) and β-catenin (p < 0.05), thereby restoring the integrity of the blood‒testis barrier (BTB). Mechanistically, ECD not only reversed lipid-induced inhibition of SIRT1 but also suppressed p53 acetylation, leading to a significant decrease in the ratios of cleaved caspase-3/caspase-3 (p < 0.05) and Bax/Bcl-2 (p < 0.0001) in testicular tissues. These effects collectively alleviated mitochondria-mediated apoptosis in the testes of obese mice. ECD alleviates mitochondria-mediated apoptosis in testicular tissues by regulating the SIRT1/p53 axis, thereby mitigating obesity-related SD. These findings highlight ECD as a potential therapeutic agent for the management of obesity-related male infertility.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the effects of the 'five-in-one&apos; comprehensive intervention program on the fat reduction and physical exercise attitudes of obese female college students. From March 2022 to May 2023, 46 obese female college students(body fat ratio(BFR) ≥30%) from Chongqing Water Resources and Electric Engineering College were selected as the subjects of the study. Using a random number table, the subjects were divided into a comprehensive intervention group(24 participants) and a general intervention group(22 participants). The general intervention group received three standard interventions: dietary control, high-intensity interval training, and behavioral therapy. In addition to these, the comprehensive intervention group underwent an additional two interventions: functional movement correction(including screening for functional movements, relief of physical discomfort, posture adjustment, and correction of movement patterns to reduce injuries, correct functional disorders, and enhance training experience) and breathing training(including in-body oxygen level testing, light breathing, correct breathing, and simulated high-altitude breathing exercises to reduce appetite, enhance physical fitness, and improve training experience). Both groups underwent a 12-week concentrated intervention. After the intervention, follow-up observations were conducted for one year. Physical indicators, including body oxygen level test(BOLT), functional movement screening(FMS), attitudes towards physical exercise, weight, body mass index(BMI), and BFR, were collected at the start of the study(T0), one day after the 12-week intervention(T1), and one day after the one-year observation period(T2). At the T1 time point, compared to the general intervention group, the BOLT(22.68±5.95 vs.17.47±5.01), FMS(17.06±2.82 vs.15.08±3.31), and attitude towards physical exercise(230.69±19.73 vs.212.88±18.04) in the comprehensive intervention group were significantly higher(P&lt;0.01). Compared to the T0 time point, the BOLT(24.23±7.57 vs.15.47±4.90), FMS(16.75±2.64 vs.13.03±3.93), and attitude towards physical exercise(213.78±23.12 vs.196.56±18.82) in the comprehensive intervention group at the T2 time point showed statistically significant differences(P&lt;0.05). In contrast, the BOLT(16.62±3.97 vs.15.22±5.74), FMS(13.36±3.27 vs.13.32±3.79), and attitude towards physical exercise(201.41±15.24 vs.198.30±13.87) in the general intervention group did not show statistically significant differences between the T0 and T2 time points(P&gt; 0.05). Compared to the general intervention group, the comprehensive intervention group showed a significant decrease in weight(66.97±4.59 vs.69.95±4.13), BMI(25.90±5.12 vs.28.41±2.44), and BFR(33.43±4.4 vs.36.35±2.55) at the end of the second year(P&lt;0.01). The \"five-in-one\" comprehensive intervention program can effectively regulate the energy compensation mechanism, improve the BOLT, FMS and attitude towards physical exercise of obese female college students, and effectively reduce their weight. In addition, it can effectively maintain the body shape indicators after the end of the dry period and inhibit the rebound of obesity.",

    "abstract": "Very low energy diets (VLEDs) are effective for rapidly reducing weight in individuals with obesity. They are also associated with a greater fat free mass (FFM) reduction compared to other energy restricted diets. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to determine whether the addition of exercise reduces FFM loss during VLED-induced rapid weight loss in people with overweight or obesity. CENTRAL, CINAHL, Medline and Embase databases were systematically searched from inception to October 2024 for randomised controlled trials that combined exercise with VLEDs in adults aged 18-65 with overweight or obesity. The primary outcome was change in FFM. The Cochrane Risk of Bias version 2 tool was used to assess risk of bias. Seven eligible studies (n = 292) were identified. A meta-analysis of five studies (n = 241) showed that VLED with exercise resulted in a higher retention of FFM compared to VLED alone (mean difference = 0.83 kg, 95 % CI 0.17-1.49, p = 0.01). A sub-group analysis was unable to detect any effect from specific exercise modalities. These findings may be limited by the low number and risk of bias of the included studies. Overall, these results suggest the addition of exercise to a VLED may mitigate FFM loss. Greater consistency in reporting exercise prescriptions will improve comparability of exercise modalities and enable the implementation of these therapies in the clinical setting.

    "abstract": "Obesity and hypertension may impair left ventricular (LV) mass, promote LV dysfunction, and affect epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) composition and function. The study aimed to assess the effects of different dietary regimens on LV mass and geometries, diastolic function, and EAT in post-menopausal women with hypertension and obesity. In the present analysis, 43 menopausal women with uncomplicated hypertension and obesity underwent echocardiographic assessment of LV mass and geometries, diastolic function and EAT thickness. Anthropometric evaluation, bio-impedance analyses, and laboratory tests were also performed at baseline and predefined time intervals. Participants were assigned to one of three dietary regimens: very low-calorie ketogenic diet (VLCKD), intermittent fasting (IF) or free diet (FD). All parameters were recorded before and after six months of dietary restriction. At baseline no significant differences were observed among different dietary groups for echocardiographic parameters. After 6 months, significant decrease in LV mass indexed by height (from 90.71 ± 7.35 to 81.29 ± 11.32 g/m; P = 0.01), RWT (from 0.43 ± 0.04 to 0.40 ± 0.04; p = 0.03), and EAT (from 7.00 ± 0.82 to 4.76 ± 0.40; p < 0.01) were observed in the VLCKD compared to baseline values. Spearman analysis revealed a strong correlation between EAT and fat body percentage (r = 0.53; p < 0.01), along with a moderate negative correlation with phase angle (r = -0.54; p < 0.01); the cutoff values for these correlations were 30.95 and 5.85, respectively. In this sample of post-menopausal women with hypertension and obesity, we firstly demonstrated that VLKD induced significant reduction in LV mass and EAT, whilst no significant changes were observed with IF and FD.",

    "abstract": "Cannabinoid receptor 1 inhibition poses an effective treatment strategy in obesity, but has a risk of psychiatric side effects. As high-fat diet (HFD)-feeding acutely increases expression of endocannabinoid synthesis enzymes and circulating endocannabinoid levels in mice, here we tested whether inhibition of these enzymes alleviates metabolic disturbances caused by high-fat diet feeding. C57BL/6J mice received daily intraperitoneal injections with a NAPE-PLD inhibitor (LEI-401), DAGL inhibitor (DH-376), or vehicle for 1 week while on a HFD. An extra group of vehicle-treated mice was maintained on regular chow diet. Both inhibitors effectively lowered blood and brain levels of endocannabinoids after 1 week of treatment. DH-376 reduced plasma insulin levels compared with vehicle (-53%) already within 2 h after the first dose. In contrast, LEI-401 did not change insulin or glucose levels. Both inhibitors suppressed caloric intake during the first day of treatment (-25% and -21%, respectively). In addition, LEI-401 elevated carbohydrate oxidation. The combined effect was a 2.0 and 1.6 g lower body weight after 24 h, respectively. Nevertheless, after 1 week body weight was no longer different between the HFD-fed groups. Moreover, DH-376 increased brown adipose tissue weight and reduced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. DAGL and NAPE-PLD inhibition effectively lower levels of endocannabinoids and related bioactive lipids. Both inhibitors caused a transient reduction in food intake and body weight, but also led to alterations in glucose homeostasis. The long-term effects of endocannabinoid biosynthesis inhibitors on (cardio)metabolic health remains to be investigated.",

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) can non-invasively measure proton density fat fraction (PDFF), providing quantitative methods for monitoring adipose tissue composition changes during obesity treatment. However, the comparative reliability of MRI versus MRS for evaluating SAT PDFF changes during weight loss, and the differential responses of superficial versus deep SAT depots, remain unclear. This study aimed to compare MRI and MRS methods in evaluating SAT PDFF variations in people with obesity before and after weight loss, compare PDFF changes between superficial and deep SAT, and examine associations with standard anthropometric markers. A human intervention study was conducted on adults with obesity [body mass index (BMI) ≥30 kg/m A short-term weight loss intervention significantly reduced SAT PDFF, as measured by MRI (r=0.41, P=0.01) and MRS (r=0.38, P=0.01). MRI and MRS measurements of SAT PDFF demonstrated strong agreement at baseline (r=0.67, P<0.01), after weight loss (r=0.81, P<0.01), and for changes in PDFF (r=0.75, P<0.01). A significant decrease in PDFF was observed in both superficial and deep SAT after weight loss (P<0.01), with a significant difference in PDFF between the two depots after weight loss (P<0.05). Weight loss correlated significantly with decreases in both deep SAT PDFF (r=0.34, P<0.01) and superficial SAT PDFF (r=0.48, P<0.05). Furthermore, PDFF reductions correlated significantly with decreases in BMI (r=0.44, P<0.01) and body fat percentage (r=0.59, P<0.01). Both MRI and MRS can reliably quantify PDFF in SAT of people with obesity undergoing weight loss interventions. Both deep and superficial SAT PDFF decrease after weight loss and SAT PDFF reduction is related to body fat changes after weight loss.",

    "abstract": "Overweight and obesity have a negative impact on health and have a detrimental effect on the operational readiness of soldiers. Different prevention and intervention measures against obesity include diet, physical activity, education, coaching or medication or a combination of several aspects have been investigated. This review systematically assesses the effectiveness of lifestyle, dietary, educational, and pharmacological interventions on weight, body composition, and military readiness in active-duty personnel. We carried out a systematic review based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A search was conducted in various electronic databases from 2000 to July 2024. The search strategy combined three concepts: military population, outcome terms, interventions or programs. For the review, 21 articles met the inclusion criteria (total n = 1696). Where possible, the effect size (ES) was calculated. In studies that only examined exercise, minor effects were reported, e.g. a reduction in weight (-0.5 kg), Body Mass Index (BMI) (-0.3 kg/m²), waist circumference (-0.1 cm) and body fat percentage (-1.1%) without relevant statistical ES. Studies with nutritional programs reported low to moderate ES. Combined programs including dietary and exercise countermeasures showed to be more effective than programs based on diet or exercise alone. Combined programs with exercise and educational methods showed a moderate to large effect size (ES 0.6-1.3) for weight reduction. Pharmacological treatment for reducing fat intake resulted in a larger effect sizes for weight loss. The greatest efficacy (ES > 1.0) was observed for a combined intervention program consisting of lifestyle changing components based on individually tailored cognitive behavioral therapies, psychoeducation, exercise and nutritional interventions. Effective countermeasure for reducing body weight found in this study were combined interventions, like education on lifestyle changes, dietary habits and promotion of physical activity in military personnel, as well as by ketogenic dietary interventions combined with physical activity and followed by pharmacological intervention approaches. Combined interventions appear promising in some studies, but future evaluations may focus on combinations of physical activity and exercise with new pharmaceutical approaches like Semaglutide or Bimagrumab medication in the long term for military personnel due to probable favorable body composition adaptations and military readiness.",

Concerns about reducing muscle mass and performance have been rising during weight loss, as muscle mass and functionality are crucial for health.

We conducted a thorough search of databases including Embase, PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science up to July 19, 2025. Three aspects of muscle assessment were conducted, including muscle mass, power and strength, aerobic metabolic capacity, and endurance. We included randomized and non-randomized controlled studies that compared the KD with other dietary interventions. Studies without control groups were excluded. A random-effects model would be utilized when significant differences in populations and interventions across studies were of concern. The GRADE system was employed to assess evidence quality, while evidence reliability was gauged via sensitivity analysis. A total of 33 studies were analyzed, revealing no significant differences between the KD and other diets in muscle mass (WMD: 0.06, 95%CI: -1.97 to 2.09, p = 0.95), muscle power (countermovement jump: SMD: -0.06, 95%CI: -0.49 to 0.38, p = 0.80) and strength (squat: SMD: -0.19, 95%CI: -0.53 to 0.15, p = 0.27; bench press: SMD: -0.15, 95%CI: -0.49 to 0.18, p = 0.37). However, a significant decrease in fat-free mass (WMD: -0.48, 95%CI: -0.73 to -0.23, p < 0.001) and fat mass (WMD: -1.31, 95%CI: -2.06 to -0.57, p < 0.001) was observed in the KD group compared with the control group. The KD also improved fat oxidation (WMD: 0.13, 95%CI: 0.08 to 0.17, p < 0.001) and reduced respiratory exchange ratio (WMD: -0.07, 95%CI: -0.11 to -0.03, p < 0.001) during an exercise test. The VO Among adult populations, KD can increase fat oxidation to modify muscle metabolism, while no significant reduction in muscle mass or strength was observed. Additional well-designed randomized controlled trials are warranted to definitively determine the effects of ketogenic diets on muscle parameters.",

    "abstract": "Hypertension affects over 1.2 billion adults worldwide. While numerous pharmacological treatments are available for managing hypertension, dietary approaches may also offer beneficial alternatives or complementary strategies. High molecular weight (HMW) β-glucan, a fibre found in oats, may be responsible for reductions in systolic blood pressure. This pilot trial investigated the efficacy of HMW oat β-glucan in reducing systolic and diastolic blood pressure in individuals with mild hypertension. Additionally, changes in heart rate, body weight, waist circumference, and dietary intake, including protein, carbohydrates, fat, and fibre were assessed. This study was conducted virtually during the COVID-19 pandemic. The trial followed a randomized, double-blinded, cross-over design. During the treatment period, participants were provided breakfast cookies made from oats containing 4 g/day of HMW oat β-glucan. During the control period, participants received breakfast cookies made primarily from wheat, which does not contain a significant amount of β-glucan (0.12 g/day). Twenty-one people completed the trial. Consumption of oat β-glucan breakfast cookies for 4 weeks did not reduce systolic blood pressure (132.71 ± 1.92 vs. 132.9 ± 1.92, ",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to assess the impact of pA1c®HI postbiotic administration on glucose metabolism, weight management, body composition, and metabolic health in obese individuals, both with and without prediabetes. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted with patients diagnosed with obesity. A total of 17 participants were administered either 1 capsule per day containing 1 × 10 pA1c®HI consumption led to a glucose metabolism improvement, evidenced by reductions in HbA1c (-0.22 ± 0.07%; P = 0.018) compared with placebo. Although the difference between groups did not reach statistical significance, the intervention with pA1c®HI also led to improvements in other anthropometric measurements, including reductions in total weight, body mass index (BMI), fat mass, and visceral fat, alongside an increase in lean mass in comparison with placebo. Moreover, it was observed that supplementation with pA1c®HI reduced -8.8 ± 3.2 mm Hg (P = 0.029) the diastolic blood pressure compared to the placebo group. In a post-hoc analysis including the group of participants with prediabetes, pA1c®HI exhibited a trend toward reducing glycemia (11.8 ± 6.8%; 11.17 ± 6.4 mg/dL), HbA1c (0.17 ± 0.1%), HOMA-IR (60.2 ± 48.5%; 2.73 ± 2.2 points), and insulin levels (50 ± 42.1%; 9.74 ± 8.2 μU/mL) in comparison with placebo. Regarding lipid metabolism, while the differences observed between both groups were not statistically significant, clinically significant improvements in the postbiotic group were seen, highlighting decreases in total weight (1.55 ± 1.5 kg; P = 0.04), BMI (0.59 ± 0.5 points; P = 0.04), and fat mass (1.95 ± 1.3 kg; P = 0.016).

    "abstract": "To investigate the effect of  In a mouse model of NAFLD, the therapeutic effect of CSP was evaluated by measuring serum glucose, lipid profiles (TC, TG, LDL-C, HDL-C), and hepatic function markers. Network pharmacology was employed to identify active compounds in CSP and their targets using TCMSP, HERB, SwissTargetPrediction, GeneCards, OMIM, and DisGeNET. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, Gene Ontology (GO), and KEGG pathway analyses were conducted. Molecular docking (AutoDock Vina) was used to assess the compound-target binding affinities. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to validate the mRNA expressions of the core genes in the liver tissue of the mouse models. In the mouse model of NAFLD, treatment with CSP significantly reduced body weight gain and serum TG levels of the mice, and high-dose CSP treatment resulted in obvious reduction of ALT levels and hepatic fat accumulation. Network pharmacology analysis identified quercetin and 2-monolinolenin as the key bioactives in CSP, which target TNF, AKT1, IL6, TP53, and ALB. Docking simulations suggested strong binding between the two core compounds and their target proteins. The results of qRT-PCR showed that high-fat diet induced significant downregulation of Tp53, Cpt1, and Ppara expressions in mice, which was effectively reversed by CSP treatment. CSP can improve lipid metabolism disorders in NAFLD mice through a regulatory mechanism involving multiple targets and pathways to reduce liver fat accumulation and protect liver function. The key components in CSP such as quercetin and linolenic acid monoacylglycerol may participate in the regulation of such metabolic processes as fatty acid oxidation by targeting TP53. ",

    "abstract": "Introduction: the effectiveness of the ketogenic diet (KD) as a therapeutic approach for managing weight, hormonal, and metabolic aspects of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) requires further clarification despite its growing popularity. Objectives: this study evaluated the short-term effects of a 4-week low-calorie ketogenic diet (LCKD) on body composition, biochemical, and hormonal parameters in overweight or obese women with PCOS. Methods: thirteen women with PCOS (mean age 29.77 ± 7.54 years, median BMI 27.2 kg/m²) participated in this clinical intervention study. Body composition (bio-electrical impedance), anthropometric measurements, and biochemical/hormonal parameters were assessed pre- and post-intervention. Results: participants achieved a mean body weight loss of 6.90 % ± 2.04 %. Significant reductions were observed in body weight, BMI, fat percentage, fat mass, fat-free mass, waist, hip, and neck circumferences, and waist-to-hip/waist-to-height ratios (p < 0.05). LCKD also led to significant decreases in fasting glucose, insulin, HOMA-IR, HDL-cholesterol, prolactin, and IGF-1 levels (p < 0.05). Conversely, sexual hormon binding globulin (SBHG) and TNF-α levels significantly increased (p < 0.05). Multiple regression analysis indicated that changes in waist (t = 4.196), hip (t = 3.983), and neck (t = -2.820) circumferences significantly impacted prolactin levels, while changes in fat percentage (t = -3.326, p = 0.021), fat mass (t = 3.501, p = 0.017), and hip circumference (t = 2.905, p = 0.034) influenced SHBG levels (p < 0.05). Conclusions: short-term LCKD intervention shows potential as a therapeutic dietary strategy, yielding beneficial effects on both anthropometric and key biochemical parameters in overweight or obese women with PCOS. Introducción: la dieta cetogénica (DC) ha ganado popularidad como tratamiento para el control del peso y los aspectos hormonales del síndrome del ovario poliquístico (SOP), aunque su eficacia requiere más investigación. Objetivos: este estudio tuvo como objetivo evaluar los efectos a corto plazo de una dieta cetogénica baja en calorías (DCE) de 4 semanas en mujeres con sobrepeso u obesidad y SOP. Metodología: se incluyeron trece mujeres (edad media: 29,77 años, IMC: 27,2 kg/m²) en este estudio de intervención. Se midieron la composición corporal, las medidas antropométricas y los parámetros bioquímicos y hormonales antes y después de la intervención. Resultados: Los resultados mostraron una pérdida media de peso del 6,90 %. Se observaron reducciones significativas en el peso corporal, IMC, porcentaje de grasa, masa grasa, circunferencias de cintura, cadera y cuello, así como en la relación cintura-cadera/cintura-estatura (p < 0,05). Además, se produjeron disminuciones significativas en los niveles de glucosa en ayunas, insulina, HOMA-IR, colesterol HDL, prolactina e IGF-1 (p < 0,05), mientras que los niveles de globulina fijadora de hormonas sexuales (SHBG) y TNF-α aumentaron (p < 0,05). El análisis de regresión múltiple mostró que la circunferencia de la cintura, la cadera y el cuello influyeron en los niveles de prolactina, mientras que los cambios en el porcentaje de grasa y la masa grasa impactaron en los niveles de SHBG. Conclusiones: la intervención DCE a corto plazo muestra potencial como estrategia dietética terapéutica, con efectos beneficiosos tanto en parámetros antropométricos como bioquímicos clave en mujeres con sobrepeso u obesidad y SOP.",

    "abstract": "The prevalence of pediatric overweight and obesity is steadily increasing, posing a tremendous problem and challenge to public health. Various strategies have been undertaken to combat this issue with mixed results. This study aimed at assessing the effect of a 9-week dietary intervention on anthropometric measurements and blood pressure among children aged 7-12 years with excessive body weight. The main aim of the intervention was to improve the children's eating habits according to dietary guidelines for Polish children and adolescents with an individual approach and dietitian support. The intervention was completed by 68 children, 38 girls and 30 boys. Data on nutrition; anthropometrics, including body composition; and blood pressure were collected at baseline and after 3, 6, and 9 weeks of the dietary intervention. The 9-week dietary intervention resulted in significant reductions in BMI z-score, fat mass, and body weight of 10.7%, 7.6%, and 4.0%, respectively. Blood pressure, especially diastolic blood pressure, also significantly decreased. Moreover, positive changes in dietary behaviors were noted. A 9-week dietary intervention based on an appropriate, high-quality diet in line with the Healthy Eating Pyramid guidelines, with individual counselling and constant monitoring of the implemented changes, an individual approach, support from a dietitian, and the involvement of parents or guardians, can be an effective tool for starting to improve the diets and health of overweight children.",

    "abstract": "Obesity remains a major epidemic in developed countries, with metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) as one of its main hepatic consequences. Pharmacological treatments for MAFLD are limited, but modulation of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) or acylethanolamide signalling offers promising therapeutic potential, while exerting anti-obesity effects. This study evaluated the effects of a combined therapy using a dual ligand targeting peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) and peripheral cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) (OLHHA, acting as a PPARα agonist and CB1 antagonist) in combination with the GLP-1 receptor agonist liraglutide. Our aim was to assess their potential as a multitarget therapy to ameliorate liver dysfunction in an obesity animal model. In Wistar rats, we evaluated the effects of administering 3 mg/kg OLHHA and 25  µg/kg liraglutide, both acutely and chronically (daily for 42 days), in the context of exposure to a high-fat/high-fructose diet. Although both OLHHA and liraglutide individually ameliorated certain hepatic alterations induced by MAFLD, our findings demonstrate that their combined administration was significantly more effective in promoting body weight loss, improving lipid profiles and transaminase levels, and exerting robust antisteatotic effects in obese rats. This enhanced efficacy was evidenced by a marked reduction in hepatic fat content, downregulation of lipogenesis-related enzymes, and upregulation of proteins involved in lipid oxidation. Moreover, OLHHA, either alone or in combination with liraglutide, efficiently restored redox balance disrupted by MAFLD in obese rats. Collectively, these results highlight the potential of this multitarget therapeutic strategy for the treatment of obesity, MAFLD, and their associated comorbidities.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) represents a growing public health challenge in Egypt, driven by westernized dietary patterns, urbanization, and physical inactivity. Despite lifestyle intervention being the first-line management, data on structured hypocaloric diets tailored to Egyptian patients remain limited, particularly regarding their effects on hepatic steatosis, inflammatory pathways, and oxidative stress biomarkers. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of a culturally adapted 6-month hypocaloric diet on hepatic fat reduction, metabolic parameters, inflammatory-oxidative biomarkers, and lifestyle factors in Egyptian MASLD patients, with additional exploration of weight-independent mechanisms. In this single-center interventional trial, 30 newly diagnosed MASLD patients received a personalized hypocaloric diet (500-1000 kcal/day deficit). Outcomes measured at baseline and post-intervention included anthropometrics, liver enzymes, metabolic profile, hepatic steatosis (CAP score), inflammatory markers (TNF-α, MDA), antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT), and lifestyle behaviors (physical activity, sleep). Advanced statistical analyses included effect size estimation, multivariate regression, mediation analysis, and subgroup comparisons (lean vs. obese MASLD). After 6 months, patients achieved significant reductions in weight (- 10.9 kg), BMI (- 3.9 kg/m A culturally tailored hypocaloric diet effectively improved hepatic steatosis, inflammatory status, and antioxidant capacity in Egyptian MASLD patients. These improvements were partially weight-independent and partially mediated by anti-inflammatory responses. These findings support hypocaloric dietary strategies as a potentially scalable therapeutic option for MASLD management in resource-limited settings, though the absence of a control group limits causal inference, and further evaluation of implementation feasibility and cost-effectiveness is warranted. Additional benefits were also observed in lifestyle behaviors such as physical activity and sleep.",

    "title": "Effects of a Probiotic Formulation Based on SF68, Phytosterols, and 6S-5-Methyltetrahydrofolic Acid on Body Composition, Biochemical Parameters, Gut Microbiota, and Gastrointestinal and General Symptoms of Overweight/Obese Subjects: The PrObesity Study.",
    "abstract": "Obesity and dyslipidemia are increasingly widespread. Considering gut microbiota's (GM) role in energy balance, probiotics represent a promising non-pharmacological approach. This study assessed a probiotic formulation (SF68 + phytosterols + (6S)-5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid) on anthropometric, biochemical, and GM parameters, as well as gastrointestinal and general symptoms, in overweight/obese individuals with low-to-moderate cardiovascular risk. Forty participants (30F, mean age 51.5 ± 11 years) were randomized to receive either the probiotic or placebo daily for 12 weeks. Anthropometric data, questionnaires, and biological samples were collected pre- and post-intervention. While both groups showed significant (p < 0.05) improvements, the probiotic group showed greater reductions in waist circumference (-1.8 cm), fat mass (-1.8 kg; -1.7%), total cholesterol (-11 mg/dL), and LDL-cholesterol (-10.3 mg/dL), along with an increased HDL/LDL ratio (+0.1). Both probiotic and placebo resulted in a significant reduction in HbA1c (-1.7 mmol/mol and -1.5 mmol/mol, respectively). The probiotic formulation also reduced erythrocyte ROS (-29.7%), granulocyte ROS (-28.4%), and plasma nitrite/nitrate (49.5%) and significantly increased erythrocyte glutathione (GSH; +81.9%). Gastrointestinal symptoms improved, and GM analysis showed an increased Evenness index and reduced Lachnospirales abundance after probiotic treatment. These findings suggest the multi-component probiotic formulation may support metabolic and gut health in overweight or obese individuals, although further research is warranted.",

    "title": "The effect of early time-restricted eating on muscle damage-related biomarkers and anxiety in older men.",
    "abstract": "This study investigates the effects of early Time-Restricted Eating (eTRE) on body composition, biochemical markers of muscle damage, and anxiety levels in healthy elderly men. Thirty participants were randomly assigned to either an eTRE intervention group or a control group. The eTRE group consumed all daily caloric intake within an 8-h window (7:00 AM to 3:00 PM) for a period of two months, while the control group maintained their usual eating habits. Assessments were conducted at baseline (T0) and post-intervention (T1), including anthropometric measurements, blood biomarker analysis, and anxiety evaluation using the State-Trait Inventory for Cognitive and Somatic Anxiety (STICSA). Within-group analyses using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and paired t-test revealed significant improvements in weight, body mass index (BMI), body fat, and fat-free mass in the eTRE group (all p < 0.01). Significant decreases were also found in muscle damage and inflammation markers, including CPK (p = 0.0067), AST (p < 0.0001), CRP (p = 0.0011), and bilirubin (p = 0.044), indicating reduced physiological stress and improved liver function. Two-way repeated measures ANOVA revealed significant time by group interactions for BMI (F₁,₂₈ = 4.453; p = 0.007), body fat (F₁,₂₈ = 3.059; p = 0.037), fat-free mass (F₁,₂₈ = 3.908; p = 0.014), uric acid (F₁,₂₈ = 4.947; p = 0.004), CRP (F₁,₂₈ = 2.853; p = 0.045), AST (F₁,₂₈ = 14.332; p < 0.001), and STICSA scales (p < 0.05). These interactions indicate that the observed changes were significantly more pronounced in the eTRE group compared to the control group. Mediation analyses revealed that biomarkers related to muscle recovery and metabolic regulation (such as LDH, ALT, and AST) significantly mediated the relationship between eTRE and anxiety reduction. These findings suggest that eTRE may be an effective dietary approach to improve body composition, reduce muscle stress and inflammation, and lower anxiety levels in elderly individuals. Future studies are needed to confirm these effects and explore their long-term sustainability.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic adaption (MA) might be of clinical relevance in weight loss management. However, it is unclear whether resting metabolic rate (RMR) reduction in weight loss reflects true MA or fat free mass (FFM) loss. We re-analyzed the data based on a weight loss trial of 131 patients (aged 33.3 ± 6.7 years) with overweight/obesity. Anthropometric data, body composition, daily physical activity, sleep hour and dietary intake were collected for every 4 weeks (baseline, week 4, 8, 12, and 16). The linear mixed model was used to evaluate the absolute change in RMR and adjusted RMR [aRMR = RMR (kcal) divided by FFM (kg)] with two different equations (Katch-McArdle-determined vs. BIA-determined) for every 4 weeks after adjustment of age, sex, daily physical activity, sleep hours, dietary intake, and baseline FFM and fat mass (FM). Following the 16-week intervention, a significant reduction was observed in body weight [β: -5.6 kg; 95% Confidence Interval (CI): -6.3 kg, -5.0 kg], BMI (β: -2.3 kg/m The use of different prediction equations might account for variations in MA in this study. The results highlight the importance of preserving FFM during weight loss, thus to prevent reductions in RMR.",

    "title": "Clinical or cultural? Dietary interventions for lipedema: a systematic review.",
    "abstract": "Lipedema is a chronic, progressive condition characterized by symmetrical accumulation of adipose tissue, predominantly in women's lower extremities. It is frequently associated with pain, reduced mobility, and psychological distress. Dietary interventions have become central to conservative management of the condition, yet their clinical efficacy remains unclear. This systematic review included peer-reviewed studies assessing dietary strategies in individuals with clinically diagnosed lipedema. Searches were conducted in four databases in July 2025, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Eligible studies applied dietary interventions and reported clinical or psychosocial outcomes, and the risk of bias was subsequently assessed. Nine studies involving 269 women met the inclusion criteria. The majority applied hypocaloric dietary protocols, particularly ketogenic, low-carbohydrate high-fat, or ketogenic modified Mediterranean diets. Across studies, weight loss and reduction in fat mass were consistently reported. Some studies also observed improvements in pain, inflammation, and quality of life, though these outcomes were not uniformly assessed. Few studies used advanced measures of body composition such as dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry or magnetic resonance imaging; most relied on bioelectrical impedance analysis. Only one study evaluated emotional dysregulation and only one assessed food addiction, but no study systematically measured eating behavior traits, or current or past eating disorders. Intervention durations ranged from four to twenty-eight weeks, and adherence strategies varied. The risk of bias was moderate to high in most studies. Two trials (conducted by Lundanes and Jeziorek et al.) were randomized controlled trials, whereas the remaining studies used non-randomized designs despite including control and intervention groups. Due to the high heterogeneity in study design, outcomes, and measurement tools, combined with the small sample sizes and risk of bias, it was not possible to conduct a meta-analysis. The effects of dietary approaches on lipedema remain unclear. Future studies should adopt robust methodological designs, include larger and stratified samples based on disease stage, use accurate assessments of body composition (including muscle mass and strength), evaluate mental health and eating behaviors, and investigate the long-term sustainability of interventions. The literature lacks standardized methodologies and comprehensive evaluation of psychosocial and eating behavior, highlighting the need for stronger evidence to inform clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "A 12-week digital health program for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) previously showed feasibility in engagement, program retention, and clinical outcomes. This study investigates whether improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors achieved during a 12-week active program were sustained over a subsequent 6-month follow-up period. The primary objective of this analysis was to evaluate whether the clinical improvements achieved after a 12-week program were maintained over the subsequent 6-month period, which did not include coaching or new intervention materials. In addition, the study aimed to assess participants' retention and engagement with the maintenance program. In a 9-month, single-arm study using the Sidekick app (Sidekick Health), individuals with NAFLD and BMI >30 or metabolic syndrome or type 2 diabetes were included. The initial 12 weeks focused on providing education about diet, physical activity, stress management, and sleep, followed by 6 months without coaching or new intervention materials. The measured outcomes encompassed demographics, body composition, liver fat assessed using magnetic resonance imaging-proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF), and blood markers. Of the 34 participants who completed the first 12 weeks, 28 (82%) completed the 9-month study measurements. The median age was 63.0 years (IQR 53.5-71.0) and 57.1% (16/28) were women. At 9 months, compared to baseline, the mean weight loss was 4.0 kg (SD 5.0; P<.001). Liver fat decreased by 2.5% (SD 4.5; P<.001), with an 18.4% relative reduction. Systolic blood pressure decreased by 8.3 mm Hg (SD 13.4, P<.001) and diastolic by 2.5 mm Hg (SD 6.0; P=.02). Waist circumference decreased by 4.7 cm (SD 7.1; P<.001) and median glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) decreased by 19.5 mmol/mol (P<.001). Sustained improvements in liver fat and metabolic markers suggest that Sidekick Health's digital program is a promising strategy for managing NAFLD without requiring continuous coaching.",

    "title": "Changes in antral follicle dynamics following weight loss in women with polycystic ovary syndrome.",
    "abstract": "Does weight loss from a hypocaloric dietary intervention improve antral follicle dynamics in women with PCOS? During a 3-month hypocaloric dietary intervention, women with PCOS who experienced clinically meaningful weight loss showed more organized antral follicle development including fewer recruitment events, but no change in the overall frequency of selection, dominance, or ovulation. There is a spectrum of disordered antral follicle development in women with PCOS including excessive follicle recruitment and turnover, decreased frequency of selection and dominance, and failure of ovulation. Lifestyle intervention aimed at weight loss is recommended to improve metabolic health in women with PCOS yet benefits on ovarian follicle development and ovulation are unclear. This was a prospective, single-arm lifestyle intervention study conducted over 4 months including a 1-month baseline assessment period and 3-month hypocaloric dietary intervention. Twenty women were allocated to the intervention with 0% attrition. Females, ages 18-38 years, with PCOS and obesity (BMI > 30 kg/m2) underwent every-other-day transvaginal ultrasonography and venipuncture at an academic clinical research unit for 4 months. The number and size of all follicles were evaluated at each study visit, with individual growth profiles plotted retrospectively for follicles that grew to at least 7 mm. Gonadotropin and ovarian steroid hormone concentrations were measured every-other-day. Reproductive, anthropometric, and metabolic status markers were assessed at baseline and at the end of the intervention. Hypocaloric dietary intervention resulted in an average weight loss of 8 ± 3% with significant reductions in all anthropometric markers assessed including BMI, waist circumference, total percent fat, and trunk fat mass (all P < 0.05). Of the glucoregulatory and cardiovascular risk markers assessed, only diastolic blood pressure (P = 0.040) and 2-h insulin concentrations following a glucose challenge (P = 0.029) were decreased post-intervention. Antral follicle development appeared more cyclic following the intervention with the frequency of recruitment (P = 0.043), and number of follicles recruited per cohort (P < 0.0001), decreasing with weight loss. By contrast, the frequency of selection, dominance, and ovulation did not change with weight loss (all P < 0.05). When ovulation occurred during the intervention, the size at selection for ovulatory follicles decreased with weight loss (P < 0.0001), whereas maximum luteal progesterone levels increased with weight loss (P = 0.036). Participants (35%) who responded to the intervention with a shortened inter-menstrual interval had lower baseline trunk fat mass (P = 0.048), fasting insulin (P = 0.022), and homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (P = 0.017) compared to non-responders. The duration of the intervention may not have been sufficient to capture an impact of weight loss on ovulatory cyclicity. Analyses were limited to the antral stages of follicle development and any impact of hypocaloric dietary intervention on pre-antral folliculogenesis was not evaluated. The small study sample limits statistical power and generalizability of the findings. Short-term hypocaloric dietary intervention did not consistently improve ovulation frequency in women with PCOS despite clinically meaningful weight loss. Counseling related to the benefits of short-term hypocaloric dietary intervention on reproductive health outcomes should be tempered as improvements in ovulation are likely only in those with a more favorable metabolic profile at the onset. Improvements in the early stages of antral follicle development with weight loss suggest potential for longer dietary interventions to improve ovulatory cyclicity in women with PCOS.

    "abstract": "Combining natural compounds with conventional drugs is an emerging strategy to improve the management of type 2 diabetes and its precursor, prediabetes. While metformin effectively lowers blood glucose and improves insulin sensitivity, it may cause side effects or lose efficacy over time. Natural agents, particularly polyphenols, are being explored as adjunct therapies to enhance glycemic control, mitigate adverse effects, and slow disease progression. This study evaluated the efficacy of a citrus bioflavonoid-based nutraceutical as an adjunct to metformin therapy in prediabetic individuals, with a focus on metabolic, inflammatory, oxidative, hormonal, and nutritional-clinical outcomes. In this 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, participants received either metformin plus the citrus flavonoid supplement (250 mg/day) or metformin plus placebo. At the end of the intervention, the nutraceutical group demonstrated improved postprandial glucose metabolism, including a 5% reduction in 2-h OGTT glucose and preservation of active GLP-1 levels. In contrast, the placebo group exhibited a decline in GLP-1 and increased insulin resistance. Supplementation also resulted in a 12% reduction in TNF- These findings suggest that citrus flavonoids may serve as a safe and effective nutritional adjunct to metformin in the early management of prediabetes. Benefits include improved postprandial glycemia, maintenance of GLP-1 levels, reduced inflammation and oxidative stress, and modest improvements in body composition and blood pressure. Further long-term studies are warranted to confirm these outcomes and elucidate underlying mechanisms. https://clinicaltrials.gov/, identifier NCT06005142.",

Here, we report a secondary analysis from the Stroke Preclinical Assessment Network trial. We assessed the effects of fingolimod versus vehicle on stroke outcomes to better evaluate its therapeutic potential. The animal population (n=409) comprised male and female animals treated with fingolimod or vehicle. We used 4 clinically relevant models: young healthy mice (10-12 weeks-old), aging mice (16±1 month-old), obesity induced-hyperglycemic mice fed with a high-fat diet for 12 weeks (16 weeks-old), and spontaneously hypertensive rats (16±1 weeks-old). Stroke was induced by the middle cerebral artery occlusion for 1 hour, followed by reperfusion. Animals received a total of 6 intraperitoneal injections of 0.5 mg/kg twice daily of fingolimod or vehicle. Functional outcomes in the corner test and foot-faults test were measured at days 7 and 28. Lesion size and brain morphometry were evaluated at days 2 and 30 by magnetic resonance imaging. Overall, fingolimod did not improve morphological and functional outcomes. However, fingolimod effects varied depending on sex or the comorbidity model. Fingolimod promoted a better outcome in the corner test in aging females. In contrast, it favored a worse outcome in obesity-induced hyperglycemic mice at day 7. Despite having no effect on survival rates or lesion size, fingolimod attenuated the midline retraction at day 30 in aging males, consistent with less atrophy. Although fingolimod did not significantly benefit the overall primary functional outcome, its effects varied with sex and comorbidity models, underscoring how the therapeutic potential of a particular drug can differ in a heterogeneous population.",

    "abstract": "Curcumin, a hydrophobic polyphenol derived from turmeric, exhibits diverse biological activities as a natural supplement. However, its low gastrointestinal absorption significantly limits its oral bioavailability. In this study, we investigated the effects of curcumin-loaded nanospheres (CN) on adipocyte differentiation in 3T3-L1 cells and obesity development in high-fat diet-induced obese mice. CN markedly suppressed adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, demonstrating approximately 100-fold greater anti-adipogenic activity compared to native curcumin. Mechanistically, CN inhibited mTOR phosphorylation by modulating intracellular reactive oxygen species during adipocyte differentiation. Notably, CN restored fatty acid synthase expression through regulation of PPARγ phosphorylation. In high-fat diet-fed mice, oral administration of CN significantly reduced body weight without altering food intake. Furthermore, CN alleviated the accumulation of white adipose tissue and liver mass, along with a reduction in plasma total cholesterol levels. Collectively, these findings suggest that CN enhances the bioavailability of curcumin and exerts potent anti-obesity effects by targeting adipogenesis and lipid metabolism.",

    "abstract": "This study explores the therapeutic potential and mechanistic basis of a novel dairy-egg derived nutritional intervention-combining milk fat globule-epidermal growth factor 8 (MFG-E8) and egg yolk phosphatidylcholine (PC)-against dexamethasone (Dex)-induced skeletal muscle atrophy in aged rats. Specifically, we aimed to determine whether MFG-E8 + PC co-supplementation could mitigate muscle atrophy, improve mitochondrial function and elucidate the underlying mechanisms involving energy metabolism. By integrating targeted energy metabolomics, we demonstrate that the synergistic action of MFG-E8 and PC alleviates muscle atrophy in aged rats by restoring mitochondrial function and energy metabolism. Dietary supplementation with MFG-E8 + PC significantly reversed Dex-induced reductions in body mass and swimming endurance, while ameliorating histopathological features of muscle atrophy. Mechanistically, MFG-E8 + PC upregulated tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates (e.g., citrate, α-ketoglutarate, malate) and enhanced glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) by reactivating rate-limiting enzymes (hexokinase, phosphofructokinase-1, citrate synthase). This metabolic regulation was linked to increased mitochondrial biogenesis via the AMPK/PGC-1α/Nrf1 axis and elevated expression of respiratory chain complexes. Notably, the dairy-egg synergy mitigated oxidative stress by restoring mitochondrial membrane potential and reducing reactive oxygen species, highlighting its dual role in energy metabolism and antioxidant protection. These findings position MFG-E8 and PC as promising functional food components for muscle health, offering a dietary strategy to combat age- or stress-related muscle wasting through mitochondrial-targeted nutritional intervention.",

    "abstract": "Personalised nutrition that incorporates genetic results into dietary interventions holds significant potential to optimise weight management and metabolic outcomes. While traditional calorie-restricted diets remain effective, emerging evidence suggests that variations in macronutrient distribution may offer additional benefits. Genetic variants help explain interindividual differences in dietary responses, with certain alleles showing enhanced weight loss and metabolic improvements with specific macronutrient distributions. However, comprehensive reviews of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) examining genotype-based dietary effects, particularly those focusing on macronutrient distribution metabolic pathway interactions, are lacking, limiting the development of robust evidence-based guidelines for nutrigenetic counselling. This systematic review aims to assess the influence of genetic variants on weight loss outcome in adults in response to varying macronutrient distribution diets (eg, low-fat, low-carbohydrate, high-protein diets) using evidence from RCTs. We will systematically review RCTs examining weight loss outcomes of macronutrient-varied diets in adults with genotype stratifications to risk and protective allele. Multiple databases, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Science Direct and Google Scholar, will be used. Reviewers will screen studies, extract data on study characteristics, weight loss, metabolic marker outcomes and genetic data, and assess the risk of bias using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool 2.0 tool.All eligible RCTs will first be summarised in structured tables describing study characteristics, macronutrient distribution and genetic variants and will be analysed with narrative synthesis. For quantitative analysis, interventions will be grouped into three predefined diet types (high-protein, low to moderate carbohydrate and low-fat diet). Because heterogeneity across diet categories is expected, pooled effects will be estimated separately within each diet subgroup using random-effects meta-analysis, expressed as mean differences in weight change (kg). Within each subgroup, and when at least 10 studies or data are available, random-effects meta-regression will be used to examine potential moderators, including intervention duration, physical activity and ancestry. Heterogeneity will be evaluated using I Ethical approval is not required for this protocol as it involves the analysis of data from primary studies.

    "abstract": "Diet plays a crucial role in health, with low-carbohydrate diets often proposed to exert metabolic benefits. We aim to investigate metabolomic adaptations in 164 adults with overweight or obesity who were randomly assigned to high- (n = 54), moderate- (n = 53), or low-carbohydrate (n = 57) diets during a 20-week weight-loss maintenance phase of the Framingham State Food Study [(FS)2], a controlled, parallel feeding trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02068885). We measure fasting plasma metabolites by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry using samples from 147 participants who completed the study (n = 45, 48, and 54 in the high-, moderate-, and low-carbohydrate diet groups, respectively). Significant associations (False Discovery Rate<0.05) are identified between carbohydrate-to-fat ratio (CFR) and diet-induced changes in 148 of 479 metabolites at 20 weeks, with nearly all showing consistent trends at 10 and 20 weeks. Phosphatidylcholines plasmanyls/plasmalogens, phosphatidylethanolamines plasmanyls/plasmalogens, and sphingomyelins generally decrease with higher CFR, whereas lysophosphatidylcholines, lysophosphatidylethanolamines, and triglycerides generally increase. Our findings are largely reproducible in an independent feeding trial involving diets with similar CFR (Popular Diets Study, ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00315354). Eleven triglyceride species (≤3 double bonds), linked to type 2 diabetes risk, increase with higher CFR. Our findings demonstrate metabolomic changes caused by varying CFR dietary patterns, offering potential insights into mechanisms that could guide targeted dietary intervention strategies.",

Thirty-two male Wistar albino rats were divided into four groups: Adult Standard, Adult High-Protein, Elderly Standard, and Elderly High-Protein. After one month, we collected kidney and liver samples for histological analysis and biochemical assessment of MDA and GSH levels.  RESULTS: High-protein diets severely affected the kidneys of both adult and elderly rats. The livers also exhibited moderate degenerative changes. We found a significant increase in MDA levels, indicating lipid peroxidation. Additionally, hepatic and renal GSH levels significantly increased in elderly rats on a high-protein diet, suggesting a metabolic response to oxidative stress.  CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that high-protein diets should be applied very cautiously, especially in elderly individuals and those with existing kidney disorders.",

    "abstract": "The global epidemic of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a critical public health issue, particularly in New Zealand, where prevalence rates are high, especially among Māori and Pacific people. Recent research indicates that dietary interventions, particularly carbohydrate reduction, can lead to the remission or reversal of T2D. However, little is known about how such approaches perform when implemented in routine New Zealand primary care, particularly within high-risk and underserved populations. This study aimed to evaluate changes in HbA1c, diabetes status, and cardiometabolic outcomes among adults with prediabetes and T2D engaged in such a model of care. This study reports findings from a retrospective, observational, real-world, multi-site clinical audit (service evaluation) of a holistic model of care implemented in three primary care practices in New Zealand. The model of care is characterised by a three-pronged approach: whole food, carbohydrate reduction; a health-coach, behaviour-change-based delivery approach; and community- or peer-based initiatives. Audit data from 106 patients with prediabetes (PD) and T2D were analysed (median follow-up 19 months; IQR 6-32) to assess changes in glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, diabetes status, and cardiometabolic outcomes. We observed an overall reduction in HbA1c (median change -3 mmol/mol (IQR: -7 to 3),  Given the retrospective and uncontrolled audit design, findings should be interpreted with appropriate caution. However, the consistent improvements observed across multiple practices suggest that carbohydrate-reduction strategies within holistic models of care can meaningfully improve diabetes outcomes in real-world primary care settings. Future research should evaluate longer-term sustainability, implementation fidelity, and the applicability of this model at scale, particularly for Māori and Pacific communities.",

    "title": "Genetic Risk Scores for Obesity and the Effectiveness of a Diet and Exercise Intervention Program: A Historical Cohort Study.",
    "abstract": "The role of genetic risk scores (GRS) in predicting responses to the obesity interventions in Japanese individuals remains underexplored. We aimed to examine GRS and introduce and evaluate a novel efficiency score derived from data envelopment analysis (DEA) for predicting the outcomes of a combined diet and exercise program. Data from 145 individuals who completed an 8- to 12-week low-carbohydrate diet and resistance training intervention were retrospectively analyzed. GRS were calculated from 75 SNPs identified in a previous Japanese genome-wide association study. DEA was applied to generate efficiency scores using GRS as an input reflecting genetic load and initial BMI and body fat percentage as outputs reflecting phenotypic status. Linear regression analyses were performed to compare the predictive utility of GRS and efficiency scores. BMI and other measures decreased following the intervention. Linear-regression analyses revealed that DEA-derived efficiency scores strongly predicted the change in BMI percentage, whereas GRS did not. Weight loss was achieved independently of GRS. GRS-derived efficiency score offered superior prediction of intervention effectiveness to that of GRS alone, suggesting that while GRS based on cross-sectional data may not predict responsiveness to interventions, integrated metrics also incorporating phenotypic data show potential for personalizing weight management strategies, pending further validation.",

    "abstract": "A healthy low-fat (HLF) and healthy low-carbohydrate (HLC) diet are common strategies for weight loss that vary in their effects on adiposity and metabolism. Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is the major contributor to metabolism deregulation, beyond subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT). Despite strong biological evidence that a HLC diet preferentially decreases VAT, the difficulty measuring it has impeded diet trials. We estimated VAT and SAT in the Diet Intervention Examining The Factors Interacting with Treatment Success (DIETFITS) weight loss trial to compare the effects of HLF and HLC diets and effect modification by sex and insulin resistance. In a 1-year weight loss trial, DIETFITS, we compared VAT loss between HLF and HLC diets by randomizing N = 609 adults to either diet. VAT was estimated using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. Linear mixed models analyzed associations between diet and VAT. We built separate models to evaluate effect modification by sex and insulin resistance. Among 449 participants (60% women; mean age 39 years), VAT loss was significantly greater for those eating the HLC diet compared to the HLF diet at 6 months [10.6 cm The HLC diet was associated with greater VAT loss compared to the HLF diet over 12 months. The loss of metabolically harmful VAT was independent from SAT over 6 months. Direct estimation of adipose sub-types provides strong evidence that insulin resistance does not modulate diet response. Sex differences should be considered in effective dietary interventions targeting VAT reduction and metabolic health.",

    "abstract": "Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) affects 18-28 % of Western populations, with 10-40 % experiencing refractory symptoms despite proton pump inhibitor therapy. We conducted a comprehensive narrative review of dietary interventions in GERD, analyzing studies that measured clinical efficacy through validated symptom scores (GERD-Q, RDQ) and objective reflux parameters (24-h pH-impedance monitoring, acid exposure time). We examined pathophysiological mechanisms, intervention efficacy, and clinical implementation strategies across diverse patient populations. Structured dietary interventions demonstrate clinically meaningful outcomes with robust mechanistic rationale. Low-carbohydrate approaches achieved significant reductions in esophageal acid exposure time (mean difference -2.83 %, 95 % CI: -4.554 to -1.114, p < 0.001), while systematic trigger food elimination protocols achieved 23 % improvement in GERD-Q scores, enabling 45 % of patients to discontinue pharmacological therapy. Plant-based dietary patterns showed remarkable protective effects with 50 % reduction in GERD prevalence (OR = 1.96, 95 % CI 1.22-3.17 for animal food consumption). Weight management interventions demonstrated exceptional efficacy in overweight patients, with GERD prevalence decreasing from 37 % to 15 % (p < 0.01) and 65 % achieving complete symptom resolution. Individual dietary trigger identification achieved high success rates with standardized protocols. Evidence-based dietary interventions offer clinically meaningful alternatives or adjuncts to pharmacological therapy. However, significant study heterogeneity and predominance of short-term trials limit definitive clinical recommendations. Future research should prioritize developing validated precision medicine algorithms integrating clinical phenotyping, genetic markers, and microbiome profiling to optimize personalized dietary prescriptions and investigate long-term sustainability of dietary modifications.",

    "abstract": "The Ketogenic Diet (KD) is currently the most widely studied nutritional approach for patients with lipedema, although its use may cause important drawbacks especially in case of comorbidities. A Modified Mediterranean Diet (MMed) is more easily adaptable, better tolerated, and can be temporarily replaced by a ketogenic diet for a short period of time if necessary using a sort of \"sandwich\" approach. We report 10 clinical cases with lipedema and comorbidities subjected to a hypocaloric MMed for 6 months. All patients were properly assessed by anthropometric measurements and body composition before and at the end of nutritional treatment. Only 2 patients needed a short period of KD due to poor response to MMed. At the end of 6-month follow-up, patients showed weight loss with reduction in body circumferences and improvement in body composition. In the two cases where it was necessary to resort to a period of KD, good results were achieved allowing a return to the MMed for the maintenance. In patients suffering from lipedema with associated comorbidities and concomitant pharmacological treatments, the use of MMed as first line treatment allows achievement of better metabolic balance, greater compliance, and improved body composition.",

    "abstract": "Obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are among the leading global health challenges of the 21st century. While caloric restriction remains the cornerstone of weight loss interventions, ketogenic diets (KD), characterised by low carbohydrate and high fat intake, have been shown to improve metabolic health partly by modulating the gut microbiome. This study investigated the effects of a short-term KD on gut microbiome composition and function in severely obese, prediabetic patients, compared to an energy-matched standard diet (SD). In a randomised trial, patients with BMI >35 kg/m At baseline, prediabetic patients exhibited greater interindividual variability and lower alpha diversity than healthy controls. KD resulted in a significant reduction of alpha diversity, largely driven by a selective loss of Lachnospiraceae, with a concomitant increase in Bacteroidaceae. Functional profiling revealed that KD, but not SD, altered genes coding for enzymes involved in energy metabolism, amino acid synthesis, nucleic acid activity, RNA modification, and vitamin biosynthesis. Additionally, serum acetate levels increased significantly following KD. These findings underscore that KD, independent of caloric intake, acutely remodels the gut microbiome's taxonomic and functional landscape, highlighting the microbiome as a potential mediator of KD's metabolic effects.",

    "abstract": "Long-term weight loss success with dietary interventions is notoriously limited. Mobile health (mHealth) interventions offering personalized dietary guidance combined with real-time biofeedback may enhance long-term adherence and provide a sustainable solution for weight management. This study reports the prespecified secondary outcome of weight loss at 48 weeks from a parallel-arm randomized clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04165707) that aimed to evaluate the long-term effectiveness and sustainability of a Mediterranean-style low-carbohydrate diet delivered via an mHealth application paired with breath biofeedback compared with a calorie-restricted low-fat diet application. Adults with overweight or obesity ( At 48 weeks, participants using the breath biofeedback mHealth app achieved clinically meaningful weight loss (-9.54 kg, 95% CI: -12.27 to -6.81 kg). In contrast, participants using the low-fat diet app did not achieve statistically significant weight loss (-2.68 kg, 95% CI: -5.49 to 0.14 kg), resulting in a statistically significant between-group difference (-6.9 kg, 95% CI: -10.8 to -2.9,  This study demonstrates that a Mediterranean-style diet promoting carbohydrate restriction coupled with biofeedback support delivered via an mHealth app results in clinically meaningful sustained weight loss at 48 weeks. Given its practicality and demonstrated effectiveness, this approach presents a promising non-pharmacological alternative or complement for longer-term weight management.",

    "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder characterised by insulin resistance and hyperglycaemia, contributing to significant morbidity and mortality worldwide, including in Australia. This systematic review aimed to explore the most appropriate dietary interventions for managing T2DM among Australian adults. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, databases including PubMed, Medline, Embase, and Google Scholar were searched for studies published between 2010 and 2025. Eligible studies involved Australian adults with diagnosed T2DM and evaluated the effects of low-carbohydrate, Mediterranean, vegetarian, vegan, or intermittent fasting (IF) diets on glycaemic control, weight management, and diabetes-related complications. Thirteen studies, comprising randomised controlled trials, meta-analyses, and systematic reviews, met the inclusion criteria. Findings indicated that low-carbohydrate diets effectively improved glycaemic control and reduced HbA1c and fasting glucose levels. The Mediterranean diet showed strong evidence for improving glycaemic parameters, enhancing cardiovascular health, and reducing insulin resistance. Vegetarian and vegan diets improved insulin sensitivity and glycaemic control due to high intake of fibre, antioxidants, and unsaturated fats, while IF demonstrated modest benefits in HbA1c reduction and weight loss. Overall, all five dietary interventions were beneficial for T2DM management, but the Mediterranean and low-carbohydrate diets showed the most consistent and sustained improvements in metabolic outcomes. These findings support integrating dietary modification into diabetes care programs in Australia. Further research is warranted to determine long-term adherence, safety, and the optimal dietary approach for individualised management of T2DM.",

    "abstract": "Creatine is a conditionally essential nutrient central to cellular energy metabolism, with roughly half of daily requirements derived from dietary sources found exclusively in animal-based foods. Insufficient dietary creatine intake has been linked to various adverse health outcomes, yet data on creatine adequacy among individuals following special diets remain limited. This study examined the prevalence of low dietary creatine intake among US individuals adhering to different special diets using cumulative data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Data from NHANES 2003-2023 cycles were merged to identify participants (≥1 year old) reporting adherence to a special diet in the Dietary Data domain. Self-reported diets were categorized into thirteen groups (e.g., weight-loss, diabetic, low-fat, low-carbohydrate, gluten-free). Dietary creatine intake, estimated using established methods and excluding supplements, was classified as adequate (≥1 g/day) or inadequate (<1 g/day). Differences in the prevalence of inadequate creatine intake across diet types were assessed using chi-square tests with Bonferroni-adjusted post hoc comparisons. Among 8,407 participants (57.8% female; mean age = 45.0 ± 21.5 years) reporting adherence to a single special diet, mean creatine intake was 0.82 ± 0.82 g/day, with 69.5% classified as having inadequate intake. The prevalence of low creatine intake differed significantly across diet types (p < 0.0001), ranging from 83.3% in low-fiber diets to 60.4% in renal diets. Individuals following low-carbohydrate diets exhibited a significantly lower prevalence of inadequate intake (p = 0.00097), while high- and low-fiber, gluten-free, and weight-loss diets were associated with higher prevalence rates. Women showed greater creatine insufficiency than men across several dietary categories. Inadequate dietary creatine intake is highly prevalent among individuals following a variety of special diets in the US population. Restrictive or plant-forward regimens appear particularly associated with insufficient intake, underscoring the need for nutritional strategies - such as creatine-fortified foods or supplementation - to maintain optimal creatine homeostasis and support metabolic health in at-risk groups.",

    "abstract": "Weight control is a cornerstone of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) management. The low-calorie diet program continuous low energy diets (CLED) is currently offered to patients for remission in the United Kingdom, but this may not suit all patients. Intermittent Low Energy Diets (ILED) may be an alternative approach. This survey explored patient characteristics and dietary choice priorities to predict preference for CLED, ILED, and other diets to inform future patient-centered advice. 622 participants (> 18 years) with a diagnosis of T2D recruited via a patient volunteer database, social media and the Prolific research register completed an online survey. Demographics, health characteristics, T2D treatment factors and dietary choice priorities were analyzed to predict preference between CLED and ILED. In addition, we explored qualitative reasons why participants were choosing between these two diets as well as other calorie-restricted diets. CLED preference was significantly higher among all the < 65 age groups (than those aged > 74), and those who prioritized reduced medicine dependency (1.75 times more likely) and prioritizing speed of weight loss (2.59 times more likely) over improving blood sugar. ILED preference was associated with prioritizing flexibility of food choice (2.73 times more likely) and prioritizing diets which fit in with family meals and social events (2.5 times as likely) over professional support. Content analysis showed that CLED and ILED diets weren't the most popular dietary choice, with more patients expressing preferences for a daily food based moderate calorie-restricted diet and low carbohydrate diets. Simplicity to follow was a common theme across all diets, demonstrating the importance of ensuring that any prescribed diet has clear and easy instructions. Patients' dietary preferences are influenced by a range of factors including the outcome and the extent to which the diet will fit into their lifestyles. Understanding patient perspectives about desired dietary outcomes and how they envisage the diet fitting into their lives will enable professionals to provide helpful patient-centered advice which may increase the likelihood of adherence.",

    "abstract": "The Mediterranean Diet (Med Diet) has long been shown to be associated with lower cardiovascular mortality in epidemiological studies. However, the direct effect of the dietary pattern on cardiovascular risk factors is less clear. Furthermore, the effect of Med Diet interventions in non-Mediterranean populations on cardiovascular and metabolic risk is variable. A Cochrane Review in 2019 concluded there was low to moderate evidence of a modest benefit but noted that there were still ongoing trials. Since 2019, there have been a number of published trials that have not shown a benefit of the Med Diet over other interventions or usual care. It is possible that dietary factors such as quality or quantity of carbohydrate and energy restriction are more important factors, along with the degree of weight loss, than the Med Diet itself. There are also many other factors that influence the uptake and effectiveness of the Med Diet in populations that have a different traditional or habitual diet. This review paper examines a selection of 20 Med Diet intervention trials specifically looking at clinical outcomes of glucose metabolism: fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c, development of type 2 diabetes or need for hypoglycaemic medications, with or without other cardiometabolic risk factors. These trials are a mix of randomised controlled trials, crossover studies and cohort studies of greater than 8 weeks duration with more than 25 participants. There is heterogeneity in study designs and outcomes, making comparison difficult, but there is no clear benefit of the Med Diet presented.",

    "abstract": "Inaccurate energy intake assessments and dietary underreporting are important barriers to assess reliable health correlates of food consumption in nutritional epidemiology. Studies that do not account for this phenomenon may result in spurious diet-health associations. Whether underreporting occurs more frequently with special diets remains subject to investigation. This study aimed to test the hypothesis whether low-calorie and carbohydrate-restrictive diets were associated with increased odds for energy intake underreporting and investigate whether a lower carbohydrate intake (in %/total energy intake) was associated with a higher discrepancy between self-reported energy intake and total energy expenditure. This study used a predictive equation derived from 6497 doubly labeled water measurements to detect erroneous self-reported energy intake in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES, 2009-2018). Weighted underreporting prevalence was compared among 3 groups, namely, the United States general population without a special diet, individuals who reported low-calorie diets, and individuals who reported carbohydrate-restrictive diets. Crude and multivariate logistic binomial regression models were built to examine associations between diet and energy intake underreporter status. Data from 18,150 adult NHANES participants ≥20 y were analyzed. Underreporting occurred almost twice as often in participants reporting low-calorie diets [38.84% (CI: 34.87, 42.95)] and carbohydrate-restrictive diets [43.83% (CI: 33.02, 55.26)] as compared with the general population [22.89% (CI: 21.88, 23.93)]. Both diets were associated with significantly higher odds for underreporting even after an adjustment for sociodemographic factors [odds ratio (OR): 2.32; CI: 1.93, 2.79 and OR: 2.86; CI: 1.85, 4.42, respectively]. Subanalyses in participants denying any weight loss intention/with stable weight revealed a comparable picture. The lowest level of agreement between total energy expenditure and self-reported energy intake was found in carbohydrate-restrictive diets. Our findings have far-reaching implications, especially with regard to studies that associated carbohydrate restriction or low-calorie diets with favorable health outcomes while not accounting for the herein-suggested phenomena.",

For example, during fasting elevated orexigenic signals drive hunger and food seeking, whereas once feeding begins, satiety hormones and anorexigenic circuits suppress \"excessive\" intake. While adaptive mechanisms responsive to total energy balance are relatively well studied, less is known about how animals maintain macronutrient homeostasis. Mice on low-protein diets (typically ≤10 % kcal protein) often increase their overall consumption to obtain required levels of essential amino acids (except in the case of very low protein diets (<2.5 % kcal protein) where a counterintuitive decrease in food consumption related to impaired mTOR signaling in the hypothalamus has been observed) to obtain required levels of essential amino acids, a phenomenon termed the \"protein leverage effect\". Metabolic adaptations accompany this hyperphagia namely, enhanced energy expenditure, increased insulin sensitivity, and resistance to weight gain. If given multiple diet options under acute protein restriction, animals show a selective preference for protein-rich foods, and a suppression of preference for carbohydrate-rich foods. This shift in macronutrient preference presumably helps restore protein homeostasis. However, such studies have primarily focused on relatively short phases of dietary protein restriction and therefore may miss behavioral adaptations that only emerge after prolonged protein deficiency. We therefore investigated macronutrient consumption in adult C57BL/6 mice after prolonged dietary protein restriction. Contrary to findings observed under shorter periods of protein restriction, mice subjected to prolonged dietary protein restriction exhibited a generalized increase in consummatory drive, even for carbohydrate rich foods like sucrose. Our results emphasize the need to consider diet duration when assessing the behavioral and metabolic impacts of protein restriction. As restriction persists, mice exhibit more indiscriminate consummatory behavior, possibly reflecting underlying adaptive reconfigurations in metabolic or neural pathways to protect against excessive weight loss.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies advocate prediabetes remission as a goal in diabetes prevention, but the optimal dietary composition for prediabetes remission over the long term is unknown. We aimed to examine the long-term effects on prediabetes remission of a prudent diet with moderate protein and a moderate glycaemic index (GI) (akin to general dietary guidelines) vs a high-protein, low-GI diet. This study is a secondary analysis of PREVIEW, which is a 3 year, multicentre, parallel, randomised trial. Adults with overweight/obesity (BMI ≥ 25 and <30 kg/m The moderate-protein, moderate-GI group (n=923) had a higher rate of remission than the high-protein, low-GI group (n=933) at both 1 year (rate of remission 26.3% vs 20.7%; RR 1.26; 95% CI 1.04, 1.53; p=0.025) and 3 years (20.6% vs 15.5%; RR 1.26; 95% CI 1.06, 1.50; p=0.015). However, body weight and composition changes were similar for participants on the moderate-protein, moderate-GI vs high-protein, low-GI diet at 1 year (54.0% vs 57.3% of participants met the weight loss maintenance target [≥8% of initial body weight]; p=0.215) and 3 years (31.4% vs 30.4%, respectively; p=0.793). The differences in remission rates of the two dietary patterns were independent of body weight and composition changes. Following rapid weight loss, a prudent diet with moderate protein and moderate GI was more effective for long-term prediabetes remission than a high-protein, low-GI diet, irrespective of weight change.

    "abstract": "Anorexia nervosa (AN) has high mortality and relapse rates, yet no accepted pharmacotherapies. Reports based on six individuals suggest that ketogenic diet (KGD) combined with sub-anesthetic ketamine (KET) is an effective treatment. The animal model, Activity-Based Anorexia (ABA), captures AN's maladaptive behaviors of voluntary food restriction, excessive exercise, severe weight loss, heightened anxiety and relapse vulnerability. Using ABA, we tested whether (1) KGD, alone, can protect against relapses after a severe anorexia-like experience; (2) KGD must be maintained to prevent relapses; (3) sub-anesthetic KET combined with KGD is more ameliorative than KGD alone. We also (4) explored KGD's mechanism for protecting against relapses by electron microscopic (EM) analysis of synapses in the hippocampus. To simulate AN relapses, we imposed ABA induction twice (ABA1, ABA2), with 10 recovery days in between. Animals were fed a standard diet (SD, pellet plus wet food) during ABA1 and KGD during ABA2 (SD ➔ KGD). ABA vulnerability, measured by food restriction-evoked hyperactivity and weight loss, was severe during ABA1 but significantly less during ABA2, compared to those fed SD throughout ABA1 and ABA2 (SD ➔ SD). KGD withdrawal after ABA1 (KGD ➔ SD) caused vulnerability during ABA2 to become as severe as for the SD ➔ SD, indicating that KGD must be maintained to be protective. We tested whether KET plus KGD during ABA1 can protect against ABA2 relapse in the absence of KGD or KET (KGD + KET ➔ SD). During ABA2, KGD + KET ➔ SD exhibited low maladaptive behaviors, similarly to those maintained on KGD throughout ABA1 and ABA2 (KGD ➔KGD), with greater weight during recovery. Thus, KET sustains and boosts KGD's benefits for > 10 days, supporting clinical findings that short-term KGD + KET may be an effective treatment for preventing AN relapses. EM revealed that KGD increases GABAergic synapse lengths and may reduce ABA vulnerability by increasing excitatory synaptic drive of GABAergic interneurons and increasing E-to-E synapses' role in body weight regulation.",

    "abstract": "Ketogenic diets (KDs)-very-low-carbohydrate and very-high-fat diets-have gained popularity as therapeutic against obesity and type 2 diabetes. However, their long-term effects on metabolic health remain understudied. Here, we show that, in male and female mice, a KD protects against weight gain and induces weight loss but over time leads to the development of hyperlipidemia, hepatic steatosis, and severe glucose intolerance. Unlike mice on conventional high-fat diet, KD-fed mice remain insulin sensitive and display low-insulin levels. Hyperglycemic clamp and ex vivo glucose-stimulated insulin secretion assays revealed systemic and cell-intrinsic impairments in insulin secretion. Transcriptomic profiling of islets from KD-fed mice indicated endoplasmic reticulum (ER)/Golgi stress and disrupted ER-Golgi protein trafficking, which were confirmed by electron microscopy showing a dilated Golgi network consistent with defective insulin granule trafficking and secretion. Together, these results suggest that long-term KD leads to multiple aberrations of metabolic parameters that caution their systematic use as a health-promoting dietary intervention.",

    "abstract": "Epigenetic clocks have emerged as promising biomarkers of aging, but their responsiveness to lifestyle interventions and relevance for short-term changes in cardiometabolic health remain uncertain. In this study, we examined the associations between three epigenetic aging measures (DunedinPACE, PCPhenoAge acceleration, and PCGrimAge acceleration) and a broad panel of cardiometabolic biomarkers in 144 obese participants from the MACRO trial, a 12-month weight-loss dietary intervention comparing low-carbohydrate and low-fat diets. At pre-intervention baseline, DunedinPACE was significantly associated with several cardiometabolic biomarkers (FDR [false discovery rate] < 0.05), including insulin, homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, C-reactive protein, adiponectin, and ghrelin. These associations were substantially attenuated following the intervention, with only CRP and adiponectin remaining significant. Changes in epigenetic aging measures were not significantly associated with changes in biomarkers, nor did they mediate the effects of weight loss. Our findings highlight DunedinPACE as a sensitive biomarker of cardiometabolic health in adults with obesity but raise questions about the utility of epigenetic clocks as causal targets in short-term lifestyle interventions. While caloric restriction may attenuate some phenotypic manifestations of biological aging, short-term changes in epigenetic aging measures may not fully reflect underlying cardiometabolic changes. These results underscore the need for caution in interpreting epigenetic aging as a modifiable intervention target.",

    "title": "The ecology of the microbiota in children with obesity is associated with the intake of carbohydrates and insulin resistance.",
    "abstract": "Among diet, microbiota, and obesity exists a close correlation that remains insufficiently explored, particularly within the pediatric age. We aimed to deeply investigate the relationship between dietary composition and microbiota in pediatric subjects with obesity before an educational training in a Mediterranean-style diet. 55 subjects (10-18 years) with overweight or obesity and visceral adiposity, diet naïve, or failure to a previous weight loss program were phenotypically described through clinical and metabolic parameters, including circulating LPS levels. 16S DNA sequencing was used to profile the microbiota. Lifestyle habits (KIDMED score, 24-h recall, International Physical Activity Questionnaire for Adolescents) and diet composition were assessed. Five different main enterotypes were found. Females at the end of puberty were well separated from the other subjects in the principal component analysis. Microbiota composition changed with the progression of puberty, and LPS levels negatively correlated with Tanner stages. Gut microbiota composition, considering all the clinical parameters, was significantly modulated mostly by the percentage of carbohydrate intake and insulin resistance. Carbohydrate intake ranging from 45 to 55 % determined a high number of species, but with a reduction of biodiversity (Shannon and Simpson indexes). Bacteroides dorei, Turicibacter sanguinis, and B. vulgatus were among the main species involved in signatures of carbohydrate intake, whereas an enrichment in Bacteroides stercoris was found in subjects with a low fiber intake. Adherence to the Mediterranean diet was associated with a great presence of dietary fiber metabolizers, including Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Lachnospira sp. Alistipes finegoldii and Akkermansia muciniphila were more represented in low insulin resistance, while Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum and Clostridium clostridioforme were enriched in patients with high insulin resistance. Carbohydrate content of the diet, insulin resistance, and microbiota are strictly related in children with obesity. A certain degree of dysbiosis could link obesity to a severe phenotype. Since gender and puberty status impact the microbiota signature, clustering pediatric patients for diet intervention is a challenge.",

This case report describes a patient whose initial symptoms emerged around age 9 and who was diagnosed with NPC at age 14 following gradual neurological decline. Despite being treated with miglustat, the patient's neurological symptoms worsened significantly. A high-ratio ketogenic diet (KD), based on fat to protein plus carbohydrate, was initiated as an adjunctive therapy. Following dietary modification, neurological findings stabilized. An initially abnormal electroencephalogram (EEG) normalized during follow-up. Due to significant weight loss, financial constraints and adherence difficulties, the KD ratio was reduced to 1:1 by the sixth month. At the time of the last evaluation, the patient had been maintained on the low-ratio KD for 4 years with continued adherence. The ketogenic diet is known to offer therapeutic benefits in various neurological disorders. In NPC patients treated with miglustat-particularly those experiencing seizures-a ketogenic diet may support neurological stabilization. A lower ratio KD may enhance long-term compliance.",

    "abstract": "Obesity remains a leading global health challenge, driving a surge in dietary interventions aimed at effective weight loss and metabolic improvement. Low and very low carbohydrate diets, including the ketogenic diet (KD), have attracted renewed public and scientific interest for its reported rapid weight loss effects, though evidence for long-term benefits remains limited. This narrative review critically examines the role of low and very low carbohydrate diets, including the KD in obesity management, exploring their mechanistic basis, clinical efficacy, potential risks, and long-term sustainability, defined here as the ability of individuals to adhere to such diets safely and effectively over extended periods (≥ 12 months) without adverse health consequences. A comprehensive synthesis of peer-reviewed literature was performed utilizing sources including PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, focusing on human and animal studies that assessed the effects of KD on obesity, metabolic outcomes, and safety. KD exerts anti-obesity effects through multiple pathways, including induction of nutritional ketosis, appetite suppression, enhanced fat oxidation, and improved insulin sensitivity. Clinical trials report significant short-term weight reduction and enhancements in glycemic control and lipid profiles. However, concerns persist regarding long-term adherence, cardiovascular risks, increased workload placed for the kidneys (renal strain), micronutrient deficiencies, and alterations in gut microbiota. Long-term benefits are debated, with evidence being limited and heterogeneous. The ketogenic diet presents both promise and pitfalls in obesity management. While short-term benefits are evident, its safety and sustainability over extended periods require cautious evaluation. KD may be a useful short-term strategic tool for select individuals under clinical supervision, rather than a universal solution. Future study should focus on personalized ketogenic strategies integrated with broader lifestyle and nutritional frameworks.",

    "abstract": "Classic Ketogenic Diet (CKD) is a well-known diet therapy with high fat and low carbohydrates which is used to treat children with medication-resistant epilepsy (MRE). As CKD is a restricted diet, it can cause side effects which are major reason for diet discontinuation. In this study, we aim to systematically identify and categorize these side effects by type and duration to optimize CKD use and increase adherence. This study followed PRISMA 2020 guidelines and is registered in Prospero (CRD42024566216). We searched PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar for English-language clinical trials on CKD side effects in children under 18 with MRE. The last search was conducted on January 8, 2025, with no time restrictions. Side effects from 26 clinical trials were extracted, categorized as short-term (≤3 months) or long-term (>3 months), and prevalence estimated using reference populations for each side effect. We categorized side effects in nine groups: gastrointestinal (GI) issues, neurological complications, weight loss, dyslipidemia, infection, hyperuricemia, bone mineral density (BMD) decrease/osteoporosis and renal stones. In most patients, CKD does not have adverse side effects that cause diet termination and most side effects can be managed or treated to increase adherence. In the short-term, GI issues and neurological complications were most common side effects with prevalence of 49 % and 25 % respectively. In long-term GI issues still remain the most prevalent side effects with 44 % prevalence. Moreover, lower fat-to-carbohydrates ratios like 2.5:1 KD may reduce side effects but potentially compromise efficacy. Most CKD side effects are treatable and transient and these results support tailored KD strategies to enhance adherence and improve epilepsy control.",

    "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a major global health concern. Medical nutrition therapy has a key role in T2DM management, with dietary interventions being central to improving glycaemic control and overall metabolic health. Growing evidence suggests that certain dietary strategies can exert direct metabolic benefits independent of weight reduction. The Mediterranean diet has consistently demonstrated metabolic and cardiovascular benefits, along with improved glycaemic control, even in the absence of substantial weight reduction. Low-energy and very-low-energy diets, characterized by moderate to severe caloric restriction, respectively, have also been associated with improvements in cardiometabolic markers and glycaemic regulation. Ketogenic diets promote nutritional ketosis and have shown benefits on glycaemic control, insulin sensitivity and other metabolic outcomes, often preceding substantial weight loss. Intermittent fasting strategies, such as alternate-day fasting or the 5:2 model, and time-restricted eating, have likewise been linked to enhanced glycaemic control and favourable metabolic and cardiovascular effects, although their long-term efficacy and safety require further investigation. This Review aims to provide an evidence-based synthesis of the main nutritional strategies used in the treatment of T2DM, with a focus on their underlying mechanisms, clinical efficacy and potential for sustainable long-term implementation.",

    "abstract": "The ketogenic diet has gained renewed attention as a nutritional intervention across a range of chronic diseases. This review evaluates the recent clinical evidence supporting ketogenic diet applications beyond epilepsy, with a focus on cardiometabolic, neurodegenerative, psychiatric, and oncological conditions. Ketogenic diet improves insulin sensitivity and glycemic control in obesity and type 2 diabetes, effect that are partly attributable to weight loss, but also include reduced postprandial glucose excursions, lower insulin levels, and altered substrate metabolism. In neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, ketogenic diet may increase substrate availability, cerebral perfusion and cognition function. Preliminary data from uncontrolled studies suggests potential benefits in severe mental illness. In oncology, ketogenic diet may influence tumor metabolism via glucose restriction, but clinical efficacy as an adjunct therapy remains unproven. Across studies, conclusions are limited by short intervention durations, inconsistent protocols, low dietary adherence, and high interindividual variability in metabolic response. Although emerging data suggest therapeutic potential of ketogenic diet across several conditions, routine clinical implementation is premature. Future trials should employ standardized dietary protocols and assess long-term, clinically relevant outcomes to establish safety and efficacy.",

    "abstract": "Individuals respond differently to diets for weight loss and cardio-renal-metabolic health. Advances in digital health and metabolomics hold promise for personalised lifestyle interventions. The study evaluated the feasibility and the preliminary efficacy of a digitally enhanced ketogenic diet compared with a low-fat diet, and explored the potential to use metabolites to guide personalised lifestyle interventions via digital health tools. The study randomised 60 adults living with overweight or obesity to a ketogenic diet (n = 30) or a low-fat diet (n = 30). Both groups received digital lifestyle interventions, including digitally delivered education sessions, mobile and wearable devices to monitor lifestyle behaviour and health indicators, and weekly individualised feedback through digital communication platforms. Clinical outcomes (e.g., weight, blood pressure (BP), HbA1c) and targeted metabolites were collected at baseline, 3 and 6 months. Intention-to-treat analysis and linear mixed models were used to assess group and time differences. The study successfully enrolled the planned sample size (N = 60) within 1 year despite COVID-19-related challenges. Retention rates were 73.3% at 3 months and 71.7% at 6 months. Participants were 58.3% Hispanic. No significant differences in clinical or metabolic outcomes were observed between the groups, except that the ketogenic group had significantly higher ketone levels than the low-fat group at 3 months (b = 0.2, 95% CI = [0.05, 0.35], p = 0.015). Both groups showed significant weight and Body Mass Index reductions at 3 and 6 months. HbA1c improved only in the ketogenic group (baseline: 6.0 ± 0.9%; 3-month: 5.5 ± 0.7%, p < 0.001; 6-month: 5.7 ± 0.8%, p = 0.004), and systolic blood pressure (BP) improved in the ketogenic group at 3 months (131.2 ± 12.9 to 123.1 ± 11.2, p = 0.006). Most targeted metabolites (e.g., isoleucine, leucine) decreased significantly from baseline to 3- (~21/29 metabolites) and 6-month (~22/29 metabolites) within both groups. Digitally enhanced lifestyle intervention was feasible. Both diets, enhanced by digital tools, were efficacious in weight reduction. The ketogenic diet showed potential benefits for glycaemic and BP control. Metabolite changes reflect sensitive responses to lifestyle interventions. Further research is warranted to explore the integration of digital tools and metabolic data for developing personalised lifestyle interventions.",

    "abstract": "Dietary carbohydrate restriction, time-restricted eating (TRE), and exercise are common strategies for weight loss and improving glycemic control. However, the optimal combination and sequence of these strategies is unclear. We investigated adaptive treatment strategies for weight loss and improving cardiometabolic health in adults with overweight or obesity (BMI [in kg/m ADAPT was a 16-wk group-based weight loss Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial. In total, 83 adults were initially randomized to either a calorie-restricted reduced carbohydrate (RC) diet or high-carbohydrate (HC) diet. Nonresponders (<2.5% weight loss at week 4) were rerandomly assigned to augment initial dietary prescriptions with either TRE or exercise counseling. Of 82 participants (53.8 ± 11.7 y; 84.3% females; BMI: 38.3 ± 7.2) who completed week 4 assessments, 46 (55.4%) were nonresponders and rerandomly assigned to TRE (n = 22) or exercise (n = 24). Weight loss at week 16 was similar between HC and RC (0.15 kg; 95% CI: -1.86, 2.16 kg; P = 0.88). Although the HC group showed greater improvements in fasting glucose, (-8.0 mg/dL; 95% CI: -15.29, -0.67 mg/dL), changes in A1c, fasting insulin, and quantitative insulin sensitivity check index were not different between HC and RC. Among nonresponders, assignment to second-stage interventions of TRE or exercise did not differentially affect changes in any study outcomes, and less weight loss was achieved among early nonresponders compared with responders despite the addition of TRE or exercise. The group-based program resulted in clinically significant weight loss that was similar between calorie-restricted HC and RC diets. However, counseling to follow a HC diet reduced fasting glucose compared with RC. Patients with obesity and prediabetes who are unable to achieve early weight loss may require more intensive and costly intervention strategies (i.e., meal provisions and supervised exercise) to improve obesity treatment outcomes.

    "abstract": "Estrogen deficiency is related to salivary gland dysfunction, and the prevalence of hyposalivation in women with type 2 diabetes (T2D) is higher than the general population; nevertheless, the contribution of estrogen to hyposalivation in T2D is unclear. Four-week-old female C57BL/6 mice were divided into four groups (n = 6): control, ovariectomized (OVx), T2D, and OVx-T2D. T2D was induced by a combination of a high-carbohydrate diet and low-dose streptozotocin. Estrogen deficiency was induced at 8 weeks of age by OVx. At 20 weeks of age, stimulated saliva secretion and quality, blood glucose, and serum 17β-estradiol levels were determined, and the parotid and submandibular glands were obtained, histologically processed, and analyzed for histomorphometry; fibrosis development; and the expression of interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and α-amylase. Compared with the control group we found a decrease in the 17β-estradiol concentration, an increase in body weight, a decrease in saliva secretion with alterations in its quality, a decrease in parotid and submandibular glands number of acini and α-amylase, acinar hypertrophy and fibrosis and increase in expression of IL-1, IL-6, IL-17, and TNF-α with a decrease in IL-10 in OVx, T2D, and OVx-T2D groups. In conclusion, T2D reduces 17β-estradiol levels comparable to OVx, and loss of estradiol results in hyposalivation and histological alterations through the establishment of a proinflammatory microenvironment in female mice parotid and submandibular glands.",

In addition to these and other medical applications, KDs have also become popular for rapid weight-loss and enhancing athletic performance. However, the potential negative effects of exposing developing offspring to KDs during pregnancy (gestational KD) are poorly understood, and especially the long-term health consequences. In this study, we investigated the effects of a partial gestational KD administered during the second half of pregnancy and assessed the consequences on the offspring over their entire lifespan. We found that, compared to controls, a gestational KD significantly reduced dams' litter size and litter mass and altered the litter sex ratio, reducing the proportion of female offspring, which also had lower body mass early in their life. In contrast, male offspring exposed to a gestational KD suffered a significantly reduced lifespan and a late-onset increase in body mass. We found no evidence that a KD diet influenced some adult offspring behaviors (locomotion, anxiety, depression, circadian rhythms, food and water consumption) or reproductive success. Our results with laboratory mice may not translate to human health, but nevertheless, they should raise concerns that even a partial maternal KD during pregnancy may have detrimental effects on offspring health and longevity.",

    "abstract": "The traditional ketogenic diet (KD) can cause side effects when applied in preventing chemotherapy adverse reactions (CARs) due to its unique dietary structure. This study aims to confirm that Astragalus membranaceus (HQ) can serve as a novel ketogenic approach and can be utilized to alleviate cyclophosphamide (CTX) induced CARs. After quantitatively analyzing the main components of HQ extracts, we demonstrated that oral administration of HQ extracts (3.2 g/kg) for 14 days effectively increased blood ketone body levels (648 nmol/mL) and β-hydroxybutyrate levels (479 nmol/mL) in rats while alleviating CTX (30 mg/kg via intraperitoneal injection for 5 consecutive days) that induced hematopoietic dysfunction and immune organ damages (evaluated via blood cell counts, histological examination, spleen index, and related inflammatory factors). Western blot results suggested that the mechanisms might involve the inhibition of caspase-1 activation and the expression of IL-1β and IL-18. Furthermore, compared to the KD, HQ extracts did not cause adverse reactions such as weight loss or diarrhea while exerting ketogenic effects. This study investigates the mechanisms by which HQ alleviates CARs from a ketogenic perspective and confirms its potential as natural functional food materials used in ketogenesis and the treatment of related diseases. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: This research proved that, compared to the traditional KD, HQ exhibited ketogenesis without altering the normal dietary structure and showed fewer adverse reactions. In terms of applications, HQ extracts significantly alleviated CARs. Consequently, HQ has the potential to be utilized as natural functional food materials for ketogenesis and could be employed in clinical complementary treatments, such as alleviating CARs.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we investigated the effectiveness of combining the ketogenic diet (KD) with high-dose vitamin C (VitC) as adjuvant nutritional therapy to mitigate doxorubicin (DOX) toxicity, with a focus on cardiotoxicity, while enhancing DOX's anti-cancer efficacy. Syngrafts were generated by implanting EMT6 cells into BALB/c mice. Once tumors had become palpable, the mice were divided into five experimental groups. One group received DOX alone (15 mg/kg cumulative dose), while the others received DOX with KD, high-dose VitC (4 g/kg), or a combination of both. The treatment regimens lasted 14 days, involving three DOX cycles. Co-administration of KD, high-dose VitC, and their combination did not enhance DOX-mediated tumor volume reduction, but DOX efficacy was preserved. DOX treatment induced acute cardiac injury and fibrosis, evidenced by higher cardiac severity scores and collagen deposition. KD tended to exacerbate DOX-induced cardiac injury, while high-dose VitC showed a trend towards mitigation, though neither alleviated cardiac fibrosis. DOX increased cardiac troponin I (cTnI) levels and decreased cardiac catalase activity, without affecting malondialdehyde (MDA) levels or superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity compared to controls. However, co-administration of KD with DOX resulted in a significant reduction in MDA levels and an increase in SOD activity compared to both the control and DOX groups. High-dose VitC tended to lower cTnI levels and significantly increased catalase activity. Cardiac topoisomerase IIβ (Top2β) levels decreased with DOX monotherapy and tended to decrease further with KD, but peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1α) levels were unaffected. DOX induced weight loss and decreased food intake, exacerbated by KD. Relative heart and spleen weights were adversely affected by DOX, with KD further reducing relative spleen weight but increasing relative kidney weight and plasma creatinine levels. Histological examination revealed pathological changes in kidney, liver, and spleen tissues, not prevented by KD, high-dose VitC, or their combination. In conclusion, while KD and high-dose VitC may offer some benefits in mitigating specific aspects of DOX-induced toxicity, their use as adjuvant therapies requires further exploration to ensure safety and optimize treatment regimens for patients receiving DOX-based chemotherapy.",

In terms of preoperative dietary management, the use of a low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD) and ready-to-eat low-carbohydrate ketogenic product (RLCKP) showed the potential to promote weight loss and liver volume reduction, creating favorable conditions for surgery. Strategies for preoperative weight loss (WL) need to be cautious, and moderate preoperative WL may help to reduce surgical difficulty and postoperative complications. In addition, the application of preoperative carbohydrate load can reduce postoperative insulin resistance and protein loss and promote postoperative recovery of patients. In terms of postoperative nutritional management, the risk of postoperative micronutrient deficiency is significantly increased. At the same time, the adjustment of postoperative dietary structure and rational use of nutritional supplements are important to maintain the nutritional status of patients and promote weight management. In conclusion, perioperative nutritional management of MBS is a multifaceted and multi-level comprehensive process that requires a multidisciplinary approach involving medical staff, dietitians, and patients. A tailor-made approach based on the patient's unique characteristics, such as nutritional status, surgical type, and personal preferences, is essential to achieve the best surgical results and improvement of patients' quality of life. Major challenges remain in perioperative nutritional management, such as the high prevalence of preoperative malnutrition and the complexity of postoperative nutritional deficiencies. In the future, more accurate preoperative nutritional assessment tools and personalized postoperative nutritional supplementation strategies should be developed.",

    "title": "The interplay between nutrigenomics and low-carbohydrate ketogenic diets in personalized healthcare.",
    "abstract": "The field of nutrigenomics explores the interaction between diet and gene expression, examining how nutrients function as signaling molecules that influence cellular processes, protein synthesis, and metabolite production. This discipline aims to design diets that promote genomic stability through various genetic mechanisms, including minimizing DNA damage and epigenetic modifications, among others. Nutrigenomic profiling helps identify individual dietary needs and responses to food interventions. Nutrigenetics, a subfield of nutritional genomics, investigates how genetic variations affect nutrient metabolism and health outcomes. It operates on the principle that genetic differences influence nutrient absorption and metabolism, shaping disease susceptibility and treatment responses. Therefore, integrating nutrigenetics into dietary planning enables the development of personalized nutrition strategies to improve health and prevent disease. One key application of nutrigenomics is its impact on various diets, including the Low-Carbohydrate ketogenic diet (LCKD), a high-fat, low-carbohydrate regimen that induces ketosis. In this metabolic state, ketone bodies serve as energy sources and signaling molecules. Research suggests that LCKD may influence gene expression and epigenetic mechanisms, modulating inflammation-related pathways, oxidative stress, and metabolic regulation. Additionally, KD has been associated with improved insulin sensitivity, glucose control, lipid profiles, and weight loss. However, genetic factors affecting LCKD response require further investigation to refine personalized dietary recommendations. This review highlights the significance of nutrigenomics, focusing on the interplay between the LCKD and genetic factors. A comprehensive understanding of these interactions is essential for developing personalized dietary strategies that optimize LCKD benefits while mitigating potential risks, ultimately contributing to individualized nutritional guidance within a precision health framework.",

    "abstract": "Kidney transplantation represents the best therapy for kidney failure, but obesity can limit access to this therapeutic option. Therapeutic strategies, such as diet or bariatric surgery, should be considered for obese patients with kidney failure. Unfortunately, there are no guidelines available to manage obesity in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). Reducing energy intake is necessary to manage obesity. This usually entails a protein intake of at least 1 g/kg of body weight, contrary to what is recommended by CKD guidelines. To date, bariatric surgery is the best strategy for weight loss, but is not indicated in some conditions, such as in patients with major mood disorders. We present the case of a woman with CKD stage G4A2, metabolic syndrome, and anxiety-depressive disorder. She was not eligible for transplantation because of morbid obesity, or for bariatric surgery due to her major mood disorder. An individualised ketogenic diet was prescribed to give her a chance to access the kidney transplantation waitlist. During the dietary treatment, there was no worsening of kidney function or any adverse effects, and the patient lost 11.7 kg. In selected cases, ketogenic diet could represent a rescue therapy for obese CKD patients allowing them access to the kidney transplantation program.",

    "abstract": "Studies evaluating the effects of novel, alternative dietary approaches for weight loss compared with the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) are lacking. We aimed to evaluate the effects of diets with varying ketogenic potential, i.e., a very-low carbohydrate diet (ketogenic diet, KD), time-restricted eating (TRE), and modified alternate-day fasting (mADF) on weight loss in obesity, compared with a MedDiet. Three-month, parallel-arm, randomized clinical trial including 160 adults with obesity. Participants were randomized to 1 of 5 groups: control (MedDiet), KD, early TRE (eTRE), late TRE (lTRE), or mADF. All diets were calorie-restricted. The primary outcome was differences in weight loss from baseline to 3 months between a calorie-restricted MedDiet and each of the four remaining calorie-restricted dietary interventions. Secondary outcomes included change in body mass index, body composition, and cardiometabolic risk factors. The mean age was 45.7 years (SD 10.7), and 70.6% were women. One hundred forty participants completed the study. Significant differences in weight loss from baseline to 3 months were found between KD and the control group [- 3.78 kg (- 5.65 to - 1.91 kg)], between mADF and the control group [- 3.14 kg (- 4.98 to - 1.30 kg)], and between lTRE and the control group [- 2.27 kg (- 4.13 to - 0.40 kg)], but not between eTRE and the control group [- 1.22 kg (- 3.07 to 0.64 kg)]. These results suggest that a calorie-restricted KD, mADF, or lTRE may be more effective for weight loss than a calorie-restricted MedDiet in obesity. Further research is needed to evaluate the long-term feasibility and efficacy of these dietary interventions compared with the MedDiet. ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04453150).",

    "abstract": "Despite great interest, there is limited clinical evidence to support the use of a ketogenic diet (KD) for cancer patients. We conducted a single-arm phase 1 trial of a KD among patients with recently diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM) receiving standard-of-care (SOC) treatment. Adults with GBM within 3 months of diagnosis followed a supervised 16-week intervention of a 3:1 KD (Fat(g): Carbohydrate + Protein(g)) plus SOC chemoradiation. The primary outcome was safety, evaluated by weekly assessments of weight and body mass index (BMI). Secondary outcomes included feasibility (pre-specified as > 50% of patients maintaining blood ketone levels > 0.3 mM over 50% of study days), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), health-related quality-of-life, and cognitive function. Twice daily blood glucose and ketones, weight/BMI, physical activity, and sleep were assessed by remote monitoring. Seventeen patients were evaluable: 53% women, median age 55, median Karnofsky Performance Status 85. All subjects met the primary safety objective with no instances of excessive weight loss or related serious adverse events. Adherence was high: all 17 patients maintained nutritional ketosis (≥ 0.3 mM/dL) > 50% of study days. Median PFS and OS were 12.9 months and 29.4 months from KD initiation respectively. Quality of Life, symptom control, and cognitive function remained stable or improved, although these did not reach statistical significance. This phase 1 trial demonstrates that KD is safe and feasible for GBM patients receiving SOC, may improve outcomes, and provides a foundation for an NCI-funded multicenter randomized diet trial to assess efficacy that is currently underway.",

    "abstract": "To identify baseline multiomic and phenotypic predictors and develop prediction models for weight and body composition loss and regain in the Low-Carbohydrate Diet and Time-Restricted Eating (LEAN-TIME) trial. A post hoc analysis was conducted of the LEAN-TIME feeding trial using data from 88 adults with overweight/obesity completing a 12-week calorie-restricted weight-loss phase and 79 completing a 28-week weight-regain phase. Baseline dietary, metabolic, fecal metabolome, and gut microbiome data were candidate predictors of changes in weight, body fat mass (BFM), and soft lean mass (SLM). Multivariable regression and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator model were used to identify predictors and develop weighted-sum prediction models. Multiomic and phenotypic models significantly outperformed phenotype-only models (P < 0.05), demonstrating strong predictive performance during both phases. During weight loss, the multiomic and phenotypic model yielded R2 values of 0.49, 0.61, and 0.54 for changes in weight, BFM, and SLM, respectively, with corresponding root mean square errors (RMSEs) of 1.59, 1.41, and 0.98 kg. For binary classification of clinically meaningful weight loss (≥5%), the model achieved an area under the curve of 0.95 (sensitivity 94.12%; specificity 86.79%). During weight regain, R2 values reached 0.72, 0.73, and 0.66 for weight, BFM, and SLM (RMSEs 1.40, 1.62, and 0.73 kg), respectively. Several key baseline predictors, primarily gut microbes and fecal metabolites, such as N-acetyl-l-aspartic acid, Ruminococcus callidus, and Bifidobacterium adolescentis, were shared for weight and body composition changes during both phases. Baseline multiomic and phenotypic data effectively predict weight and body composition loss and regain, offering insights for personalized weight management.",

    "title": "The Efficacy of Various Weight Loss Strategies in Alleviating Polycystic Ovary Syndrome.",
    "abstract": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a prevalent endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age, with its severity often exacerbated by obesity. The bidirectional relationship between PCOS and obesity contributes to a self-reinforcing and deleterious cycle. This review evaluates the effects of various weight loss interventions on reproductive, hormonal, and metabolic outcomes in overweight or obese women with PCOS. The objective is to provide evidence-based guidance for clinically relevant weight management strategies in this population. Lifestyle modification is the first-line intervention for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). High-intensity interval training (HIIT) has demonstrated potential in improving insulin resistance (IR) in affected women. Time-restricted feeding (TRF) may also improve hyperandrogenism, menstrual irregularities, and IR. The ketogenic diet (KD) has shown beneficial effects on both reproductive and metabolic outcomes. Among pharmacological therapies, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs), particularly when combined with metformin, have exhibited notable efficacy in managing hyperandrogenism and menstrual disturbances. Bariatric surgery appears to be more effective than conventional pharmacologic treatments for PCOS; however, data on its mechanisms and direct comparisons with GLP-1RAs remain limited. Weight loss interventions exert differential effects on PCOS-related symptoms. Future studies should focus on optimizing combination strategies to enhance treatment efficacy. Currently, evidence on the impact of these interventions on pregnancy rates and long-term reproductive outcomes in overweight or obese women with PCOS is limited. In addition, the absence of systematic, head-to-head comparisons across different weight loss modalities underscores the need for well-designed comparative trials.",

    "abstract": "The growing pediatric obesity epidemic has paralleled the surge in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis. It develops due to nutritional imbalances, microbiome dysbiosis, gene regulation, hormonal changes, and environmental factors like food deserts, low activity level, and an unhealthy lifestyle. The prevalence of MASLD and obesity is rising every year. Lifestyle changes remain the mainstay treatment for obesity and MASLD. Per the 2023 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases Practice Guidance on MASLD, achieving ≥5% weight loss can reduce hepatic steatosis, ≥7% weight loss can reduce hepatic inflammation, and ≥10% weight loss can reduce liver fibrosis. Therefore, nutritional interventions can be a powerful tool to help correct metabolic dysfunction and promote healthy weight loss. Current endorsed nutritional interventions for weight loss or MASLD include the Mediterranean diet, low glycemic/low carbohydrate diet, plant-based diet/anti-inflammatory diet, ketogenic diet, and intermittent fasting. This review provides evidence-based insights into current nutritional interventions for children and adolescents with obesity and MASLD to help guide pediatric gastroenterologists in making the best dietary-based recommendations in clinical practice.",

While BHB has shown potential metabolic benefits, its mechanisms of action in the context of obesity are not fully understood. In this study, we examined the effects of BHB supplementation on subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) metabolism in a diet-induced obesity (DIO) mouse model. Adult male mice were first fed a high-fat diet for six weeks, followed by a standard diet with or without BHB supplementation for an additional six weeks. BHB supplementation led to significant body weight loss independent of food intake. This weight reduction was associated with decreased adipocyte differentiation, reflected by reduced peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) protein levels and lower uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) expression, indicating altered SAT function.

Obesity is a risk factor for several cancers including PDAC due to metabolic dysregulation and inflammation. The ketogenic diet (KD) can alter metabolism and has been evaluated for its effects on tumor progression in non-obese but not obese PDAC using genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs). We hypothesized that ketone bodies and a KD alter cell and tumor metabolism. We show that ketone treatments altered pyrimidine metabolism in PDAC cells. Moreover, in an obese PDAC GEMM, KD prevented tumor progression independent of weight loss but promoted PDAC in a non-obese PDAC GEMM. The KD-specific delay of obesity-associated PDAC was associated with pancreatic metabolic shifts in pyrimidine, cysteine and methionine, and arginine and proline pathways.

Adults (N = 163) with mean (SD) T2D duration of 9.7 (7.7) years and HbA1c of 8.1% (1.2%) participated. From Base to M6, TIR improved from 61% to 87% for CGM and from 63% to 88% for BGM (P < .001), with no difference in changes between arms (P = .99). HbA1c decreased at least 1.3% from Base to M6 in both arms (P < .001). Diabetes medications were deintensified in both arms based on medication effect scores (P < .01). Energy and carbohydrate intake decreased (P < .001) and participants in both arms had clinically meaningful weight loss (P < .001). The CGM and BGM arms achieved similar and significant improvements in glycemia and other diabetes-related outcomes after 6 months in this MSKDP.",

    "abstract": "Ketone bodies can serve as energy substrates for the heart and perform important molecular signal transduction functions. In recent years, the therapeutic potential of ketone bodies has become a research hotspot in the field of cardiovascular diseases. Many previous reviews have focused on ketone bodies from the perspective of cardiovascular diseases, especially heart failure. Nonetheless, the metabolism of cardiac ketone bodies under physiological conditions also warrants attention, as the consumption of a ketogenic diet or direct supplementation of ketone bodies from exogenous sources has become widely popular among healthy individuals for weight loss. Furthermore, recent clinical studies have shown that under physiological conditions, the level of ketone bodies is positively correlated with the incidence of cardiovascular diseases and mortality. On the basis of the differences in cardiac ketone body metabolism under healthy and disease conditions, in this review, we describe in detail the characteristics of cardiac ketone body metabolism and the significance of elevated circulating ketone body levels throughout the life cycle on physiological states.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is characterized by central obesity, insulin resistance, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and chronic inflammation, significantly increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Effective management of MetS is critical, with exercise being a key intervention. This review analyzed the effects of different exercise intensities-low, moderate, and high-intensity interval training (HIIT)-on metabolic health, oxidative stress (OS), inflammation, and cardiovascular function. A search of Medline, PEDro, and EBSCO identified 2251 articles, with 159 studies published between 1999 and 2025 included after screening. Low-intensity exercise improved insulin sensitivity, reduced OS markers (e.g., MDA, 8-OHdG), and enhanced antioxidant enzyme activity. Moderate-intensity exercise showed similar benefits with notable reductions in inflammatory markers (e.g., IL-1β, TNF-α). HIIT promoted fat loss and improved metabolic markers but temporarily increased OS and inflammation. Dietary strategies also play a critical role. The Mediterranean diet and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diets are well established, emphasizing nutrient-dense foods like unsaturated fats and fiber to reduce inflammation and manage weight. The ketogenic diet (KD), a high-fat, low-carbohydrate approach, has recently gained attention for its metabolic benefits. KD induces ketosis, improving insulin sensitivity, reducing triglycerides, and enhancing fat oxidation. Studies show KD effectively reduces body weight and glucose levels, though long-term adherence and nutrient deficiencies remain challenges. Intermittent fasting also showed potential benefits, though effects on glucose metabolism were inconsistent. This review underscores the need for tailored approaches combining exercise, diet, and fasting to optimize MetS outcomes, offering integrative strategies for prevention and management.",

    "title": "Therapeutic Applications of Ketogenic Diets in Lipedema: A Narrative Review of Current Evidence.",
    "abstract": "Lipedema is an abnormal accumulation of adipose tissue, predominantly observed in women, characterised by symmetrical fat deposition and tactile sensitivity in the extremities, affecting both sides of the body. This condition can lead to significant pain, impairing daily activities and causing substantial discomfort. While the etiology of the disease is not yet fully understood, genetic predisposition, hormonal fluctuations, a stressful lifestyle, as well as traumatic events are considered potential triggers. Lipedema remains a condition with low diagnostic awareness as well as is frequently misdiagnosed as obesity or lymphedema. While obesity is a risk factor for lipedema, the abnormal fat deposition characteristic of the disease can occur across a wide spectrum of body weights, from underweight to overweight individuals. Specific patterns of adipose tissue distribution may be associated with signs of inflammation as well as heightened pain perception, as well as individuals with eating disorders, such as anorexia, may additionally be affected. Ketogenic diets have emerged as a promising therapeutic option for lipedema. Characterized by low carbohydrate as well as high fat content, ketogenic diets facilitate metabolic improvements by reducing insulin resistance as well as supporting weight loss. Furthermore, they may mitigate tissue damage associated with lipedema by decreasing inflammation as well as oxidative stress levels.Nevertheless, current scientific data regarding the mechanisms of action as well as therapeutic efficacy of ketogenic diets are limited, necessitating further research to expand their clinical application.",

    "title": "Beyond epilepsy management: A narrative review of the health effects of ketogenic diets.",
    "abstract": "The Ketogenic diet (KD), characterized by a low-carbohydrate/high-fat intake, induces a state of ketosis, where the body primarily relies on using fat for energy instead of carbohydrates. This diet is historically used in epilepsy management. Recently, KD has been the subject of increased research and public interest for its additional potential health effects. This narrative review offers an overview of the potential health effects of the KD and outlines its clinical implications. We searched PubMed and Google Scholar for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published between 2014 and 2024, exploring the health effects of KD in humans beyond epilepsy management. We included 34 RCTs on various diseases and health outcomes. The findings highlight that the KD is particularly effective for weight loss and metabolic health, making it especially relevant for individuals with obesity and metabolic syndrome, both of which are of major public health concern worldwide. Additionally, the KD shows significant promise in managing neurological disorders, particularly Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, with studies suggesting improvements in cognitive function and disease progression. The diet has also been shown to reduce the frequency and severity of migraines, offering potential relief for those affected. Furthermore, the KD may improve reproductive health, though more research is needed in this area. While the diet demonstrates benefits in these key areas, potential risks, including impacts on kidney and liver function, nutrient deficiencies, and adverse pregnancy outcomes, must be considered. The majority of included RCTs were of limited sample size and duration. Therefore, KD may be a promising dietary approach for weight control, neurological disease, and metabolic syndrome management, yet individualized guidance based on the medical history of each patient is crucial. Further research with larger samples and longer follow-up duration is needed to address existing gaps and improve our understanding of the health effects of the KD.",

    "title": "Eating a high fat/high carbohydrate diet enhances morphine tolerance, while eating a ketogenic diet mitigates morphine withdrawal in male rats.",
    "abstract": "Obesity is associated with greater prescription rates of pain-relieving drugs (i.e., opioids). However, it is not known if opioid sensitivity is altered by diet, in particular with regard to fat and carbohydrate consumption. While eating a high fat/high carbohydrate diet leads to weight gain, a high fat/low carbohydrate diet (i.e., a ketogenic diet) leads to weight loss. In this report, male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 7-8/dietary group) ate either a standard, high fat/high carbohydrate, or ketogenic diet. Morphine-induced antinociception was evaluated using the warm water tail withdrawal procedure following saline or cumulative doses of morphine (0.32-56 mg/kg; i.p.). After acute morphine testing, rats were administered morphine twice-daily, increasing in quarter log doses every 3 days (3.2-56 mg/kg; i.p) for 19 days to induce dependence and evaluate tolerance. Next, naltrexone-precipitated withdrawal was evaluated. Based on previous data, it was hypothesized that the magnitude of tolerance would be greater from eating a high fat/high carbohydrate diet, while withdrawal would be less severe for rats eating a ketogenic diet. Antinociception induced by acute doses of morphine was comparable among groups, regardless of diet. Further, rats in all groups developed tolerance to morphine; however, the magnitude of tolerance was greater for rats eating the high fat/high carbohydrate diet as compared to those eating a ketogenic diet. Rats eating a ketogenic diet displayed less severe withdrawal than rats in other groups. These results suggest that dietary intake can impact morphine sensitivity in ways that might be relevant for chronic pain management and opioid use disorder.",

    "abstract": "Obesity-related cognitive decline is linked to gut microbiota dysbiosis, with emerging evidence suggesting that dietary interventions may ameliorate cognitive impairment via gut-brain axis modulation. The role of microglial cells in this process remains underexplored. To investigate how diet-induced changes in gut microbiota influence cognitive function in individuals with obesity and their microglial activity, and to determine the impact of specific dietary interventions. This study included 96 participants with obesity who were randomised into three dietary intervention groups: Mediterranean diet (Med), alternate-day fasting (ADF) and ketogenic diet (Keto). Cognitive performance and microbiota composition were assessed pre-intervention and post-intervention. The effects of microbiota-related changes on microglial function were further evaluated in mice models through faecal transplantation and in vitro model with microbiota exosome treatment. Both the Keto and ADF groups demonstrated significant weight loss, but cognitive performance improved most notably in the ADF group, in association with reduced inflammation. Diet-related microbiota composition was correlated with the cognitive outcomes in the human study. Mice models confirmed that the cognitive benefits of ADF were microbiota-dependent and linked to enhanced microglial phagocytic capacity and reduced inflammation, accompanied by changes in microglia morphology. Fasting-induced modifications in gut microbiota contribute to cognitive improvement in individuals with obesity, with microglial cells playing a crucial mediatory role. Among the interventions, ADF most effectively enhanced microglial function and cognitive performance, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic strategy for obesity-related cognitive decline. Further studies are required to fully elucidate the underlying mechanisms. NCT04453150.",

    "abstract": "Weight loss (WL) is important for improving steatotic liver. However, there have been no sufficient reports comparing WL with liver fibrosis and steatotic changes using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The study included 111 patients with metabolic dysfunction associated steatotic liver disease who did not take any new drugs during the study period. They were evaluated using MRI and FibroScan®, and then were given a mild low-carbohydrate diet. One year later, they were evaluated again, and changes in alanine transaminase (ALT), MRI proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF), and magnetic resonance elastography were examined. The patients achieved an average WL of 4.2 kg. MRI-PDFF was significantly improved by 0.68-fold for 5%-7% WL, 0.61-fold for 7-10 %WL, and 0.35-fold for 10% or more WL (vs. gain: p < 0.01). In patients with a WL of 5% or more, magnetic resonance elastography was decreased. MRI-PDFF reduction of 30% was observed in 56% of patients with 5%-7% WL, 75 % with 7%-10% WL, and 94% with 10% or more WL (p < 0.01). ALT normalization or 30% reduction was well associated with WL, with 73% for 5%-7% WL, 64% for 7%-10% WL, and 93% for 10% or more WL (p < 0.01). The optimal cutoff for MRI-PDFF improvement and ALT improvement was 5.3% WL in both tests according to receiver operating characteristic analysis (p < 0.01). Many patients achieved improvement in MRI-PDFF and ALT with WL. WL of 5.3% can improve MRI-PDFF and ALT, contributing to a better prognosis for metabolic dysfunction associated steatotic liver disease patients.",

    "abstract": "Over the last few decades, there has been growing interest in the use of ketogenic diets, mainly as a weight loss strategy. Obesity and diabetes are major risk factors for kidney disease, and obese patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are potential candidates for weight reducing diets, among them ketogenic diets. Of further relevance to nephrology, a limited number of recent studies suggests a favorable effect of ketogenic diets in patients affected by autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). However, concerns remain about safety in patients with CKD, particularly in the long term and in those with poor residual kidney function. The confusion surrounding the definition of ketogenic diets adds to these concerns. The aim of this review is to summarize information on the main types of ketogenic diets used in daily practice and to discuss the options for their implementation in CKD patients, limiting ultra-processed or industrial preparations.Although further studies are needed to identify the profile of CKD patients who may benefit from the implementation of ketogenic diets to treat obesity or slow the progression of ADPKD, and to assess short- and long-term safety and adherence, the available data appear promising. This critical review is intended to stimulate further research.",

Triglycerides increased in all groups at week 4 (p<0.05) but returned to baseline by week 12. Neither treatment nor time affected waist circumference, fat and fat-free mass, resting metabolic rate, fasting blood cholesterol, and urine creatinine and urea (p>0.05). Protein and calcium (p<0.04) intakes were increased with time in 3D-EN and 3D-AL but not in LD-ER. Compliance with CFG, assessed by a food tracker, increased with time (77% by week 12). Frequent and daily consumption of full-fat dairy as part of a healthy diet is consistent with CFG.

    "title": "Exploring recent insights on intermittent fasting in regulating glucocorticoid levels and diet-induced metabolic disorders with focus on MAFLD and hepatic outcomes.",
    "abstract": "Consumers' risky eating behaviours aided by the current food environment have led to an increase in diet-related metabolic disorders. Metabolic (dysfunction)-associated fatty liver disease origin represents a major global health burden that is increasing at an alarming rate on an annual basis. Modifying the timing of calorie consumption, dietary composition, or caloric intake offers a promising therapeutic approach for the management of this condition. The aim of this review was to provide a concise analysis of the impact of intermittent fasting on the regulation of glucocorticoid levels and diet-induced metabolic disorders with a focus on non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases. We found that intermittent fasting primarily regulates hepatic autophagy via nutritional and hormonal pathways, aiding in the maintenance of energy equilibrium, enhancement of mitochondrial function, regulation of liver quality, preservation of cellular homeostasis, protection of cells from harmful factors, mitigation of liver metabolic disorders, and improvement of liver inflammation. Also, the physiological changes induced by intermittent fasting and their metabolic consequences arise through multiple mechanisms, including alterations in hepatic metabolism, hepatic autophagy, inflammatory responses, liver functional enzymes, hepatic steatosis, fibroblast growth factor signalling, White adipoe tissue browning, adipokines, circadian rhythms, lipid profiles, body composition, the adipose tissue-gut microbiome axis, skeletal muscle, and the autophagy process. Interestingly, we identified the complex interplay among glucocorticoids, intermittent fasting, and non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases highlighting the hepatic macrophage glucocorticoid receptor as a pivotal mediator of fasting-induced reprogramming of the macrophage secretome, including fasting-suppressed cytokines. In conclusion, existing data indicates that intermittent fasting in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases is a viable, safe, and successful strategy for weight reduction, demonstrating notable trends in the amelioration of dyslipidaemia and non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases.",

    "abstract": "As health awareness grows, more people are turning to weight loss-yet excessive slimming or dietary imbalance is quietly triggering a wave of fertility problems. Researches show that low BMI or excessive exercise can negatively impact fertility, but its specific cellular mechanism remain unclear. In this study, we investigated how adipose tissue influences ovarian function under energy-restricted conditions by establishing a peri-ovarian adipose tissue (POAT) removal mouse model. We showed that POAT removal resulted in a significant decrease in litter size, impaired follicle development, and an increased apoptosis rate in granulosa cells (GCs). Additionally, the lipid droplets (LDs) content in the ovaries and GCs was significantly reduced. We also observed that Rab14 expression was upregulated in GCs after POAT removal. Functional experiments further showed that Rab14 overexpression significantly enhanced lipophagy activity, reduced the number and volume of LDs, and inhibited the expression of lipid droplet protein PLIN2. Meanwhile, Rab14 overexpression inhibited the phosphorylation level of AKT and induced the apoptosis of granulosa cells, suggesting that Rab14 may activate the cell death pathway mediated by lipophagy. Taken together, POAT may support ovarian function by maintaining lipid homeostasis within GCs. The role of Rab14 in the regulation of lipophagy may link local adipose-derived signaling with GCs survival and female fertility.",

    "abstract": "Science is often claimed to be amid a reproducibility crisis, as evidenced by low replicability of many classic findings across multiple fields. Yet it is not clear how widespread this purported problem is. Physiological responses have potential for replicability issues because of laboratory-specific biases in animal maintenance as well as technically complex methodologies that are often undertaken using bespoke combinations of equipment. Here we take advantage of a cross-laboratory manipulative study on metabolic rate to assess the replicability of food restriction effects on metabolic scaling and level. Across seven skink species from the Egernia species complex and two universities, we found these responses to be extremely replicable. The slope of the interspecific metabolic scaling relationship was near one and animals reduced their mass-independent rates of energy use by an average of 32% in response to food restriction. This response was consistent across universities. Our study highlights that well designed and replicated studies with a large effect size can indeed be replicable and showcases the value of designing studies that allow tests of replicability to be incorporated explicitly. Such studies will be particularly valuable for treatment effects that generate a small effect size.",

    "abstract": "Buechel, CM, Pumpa, KL, Etxebarria, N, and Minehan, M. Expert consensus on weight management strategies for strength and physique athletes before and after competition. J Strength Cond Res 40(2): e155-e163, 2026-Strength and physique athletes undergo repeated cycles of weight loss and weight gain to optimize body composition for competition, often experiencing periods of low-energy availability and related health and performance risks. Postcompetition recovery strategies remain poorly understood. This study aims to achieve expert consensus on dietary recommendations for weight management strategies in the context of requiring weight loss for competition and weight restoration afterward. Fifteen international bodybuilding and powerlifting experts, including coaches and dietitians, participated in a 3-round Delphi survey. Round 1 collected responses to open-ended questions relating to weight management around competition periods. Responses were thematically analyzed into 85 statements and recirculated for round 2 where subjects rated their level of agreement with each statement. Round 3 consisted of revised statements that had previously failed consensus (30 revised and 11 new). Agreement was reached on 75 statements total (consensus threshold of ≥70%) relating to individualized weight management strategies, weight loss methods, and peaking protocols. The 21 statements that failed to reach consensus pertained to refeeding strategies for postcompetition recovery. Experts emphasized structured refeeding approaches, with most agreeing that bodybuilders require 1-6 months for physiologic recovery and a 10-15% body weight regain. Reverse dieting was not favored, with experts recommending an initial acute energy increase followed by a gradual rate of gain. Powerlifters required less restrictive postcompetition dietary recovery strategies, with most returning to off-season training within 1-2 weeks. Findings highlight the importance of athlete education, individualized weight management strategies, and structured recovery planning.",

    "title": "Caloric density alters meiotic recombination rate in Drosophila melanogaster.",
    "abstract": "Plasticity in meiotic recombination is a well-documented phenomenon with an unknown mechanism. Recent studies have shown variation in the magnitude and direction of plasticity with a putative connection to organismal stress. Though there have been many factors shown to contribute to recombination rate plasticity, dietary manipulations are understudied. Here we manipulated caloric density, which is known to contribute to well-known life-history trade-offs, to determine if it altered meiotic recombination rates. To investigate the role of genetic background, we selected two stocks from the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) with varying susceptibility to starvation stress. We found that overall recombination rates increased as calories decreased consistent with previous dietary plasticity studies in Drosophila. Specifically, while neither 0.5x nor 2x were significantly different from the standard 1x diet, we found significant post hoc differences between the low-calorie (0.5x) versus the high-calorie (2x) dietary treatments in the strain DGRP_42 but not in DGRP_217, confirming the predicted increased sensitivity of DGRP_42 to starvation stress based on prior studies. In addition to measuring changes in crossover frequency and distribution, we also investigated various organismal reproductive and physiological traits. We found significant changes in female body mass, the number of oocytes in female ovaries, and male testis length due to both diet and genetic background. We also noted significant differences in DNA damage during oogenesis via TUNEL assay. Examination of ovarian gene expression confirmed that the strain that had plasticity in recombination (DGRP_42) also had 20x more differentially expressed genes between dietary treatments. Despite diet typically eliciting a tradeoff whereby dietary restriction increases lifespan, here we saw evidence that DGRP_42 did not experience benefits from low-calorie treatment, with evidence of stress response and increased DNA damage, which suggests plasticity in recombination is due to stress. Overall, our study provides additional support for the negative relationship between metabolism and recombination rate, differences between genetic backgrounds, and a connection between organismal traits and plasticity in meiotic recombination.",

    "abstract": "Microglia, the brain's resident immune cells, constantly monitor their environment for signs of tissue damage or pathogens. Upon activation by stimuli like lipopolysaccharide (LPS), microglia undergo metabolic changes and release pro-inflammatory mediators. However, variations between human and rodent microglia, as well as differences between in vitro and in vivo conditions, likely influence microglial cellular functions and their responses to stimulation. In the present study, we compared several rodent and human model systems, including cell lines, primary cultures, induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cultures, and acutely isolated microglia, and revealed striking differences in LPS-induced metabolic changes and nitric oxide (NO) production. Using the murine microglial cell line BV-2, we demonstrated that NO was critical for restricting metabolism to glycolysis by blocking oxidative phosphorylation. In contrast, human iPSC-derived microglia and acutely isolated microglia from intraperitoneally injected rats maintained mitochondrial respiration upon LPS activation and did not show significant NO production and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression, respectively. Furthermore, we found that NO was not required for the increase in glycolysis rate or the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines upon LPS stimulation. Our results suggest that glycolysis is essential for microglial activation and cytokine production irrespective of NO production. However, the specific metabolic pathways involved may differ between species and experimental conditions. Understanding these differences is crucial for developing effective therapeutic strategies targeting microglial dysfunction in neurological diseases.",

    "title": "Allosteric Conformational Locking of Sestrin2 by Leucine: An Integrated Computational Analysis of Branched-Chain Amino Acid Recognition and Specificity.",
    "abstract": "Sestrin2 (SESN2) is a highly conserved stress-inducible protein that serves as a central hub for integrating cellular responses to nutrient availability, oxidative stress, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. A key function of SESN2 is its role as a direct sensor for the branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) leucine, which modulates the activity of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), a master regulator of cell growth and metabolism. While the functional link between leucine and SESN2 is well-established, the precise molecular determinants that confer its high specificity for leucine over other BCAAs, such as isoleucine and valine, remain poorly understood. This study employs an integrated computational approach, spanning atomic interactions to global protein dynamics, combining molecular docking, extensive all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and binding free energy calculations, to elucidate the structural and dynamic basis of BCAA-SESN2 recognition. Our thermodynamic analysis reveals a distinct binding affinity hierarchy (Leucine > Isoleucine > Valine), which is primarily driven by superior van der Waals interactions and the shape complementarity of leucine's isobutyl side chain within the protein's hydrophobic pocket. Critically, a quantitative analysis of the conformational ensemble reveals that leucine induces a dramatic collapse of the protein's structural heterogeneity. This \"conformational locking\" mechanism funnels the flexible, high-entropy unbound protein-which samples 35 distinct conformations-into a sharply restricted ensemble of just 9 stable states. This four-fold reduction in conformational freedom is accompanied by a kinetic trapping effect, which significantly lowers the rate of transitions between states. This process of conformational selection stabilizes a well-defined, signaling-competent structure, providing a comprehensive, atom-to-global-scale model of SESN2's function. In the context of these findings, this work provides a critical framework for understanding SESN2's complex role in disease and offers a clear rationale for the design of next-generation allosteric therapeutics.",

This study utilises a novel pipeline to quantify CTS and examines their interaction with digoxin within a randomised trial. The RAte control Therapy Evaluation in permanent Atrial Fibrillation (RATE-AF) trial randomised patients with permanent AF and symptoms of heart failure to low-dose digoxin or beta-blocker therapy; clinicaltrials.gov NCT02391337. Circulating CTS were detected and quantified using a new ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) pipeline. All 160 participants of the RATE-AF trial were included, with mean age 76 years (SD 8) and 46% women. Endogenous CTS detected and quantified in baseline samples included digoxigenin and digitoxigenin, plus low or unquantifiable levels of ouabain, telocinobufagin, cinobufagin, marinobufagenin, bufalin, cinobufotalin, dihydroouabain, and ouabagenin. Compared to beta-blockers, patients randomised to digoxin had better functional outcomes at 12 months for heart failure (- 0.57 New York Heart Association class, 95% CI - 0.82 to - 0.32; p < 0.001) and atrial fibrillation (odds ratio 2.24 for a two-class improvement in modified European Heart Rhythm Association class, 95% CI 1.43-3.84; p < 0.001), with lower NT-pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (geometric mean ratio 0.78, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.99; p = 0.006). No interactions were observed for any baseline CTS with each outcome. Digoxin was associated with fewer adverse events (odds ratio 0.16, 95% CI 0.07-0.34; p < 0.001), again without any interaction from circulating CTS. Digoxin levels by LC-MS/MS were strongly correlated with measurement by a clinical immunoassay (r = 0.87; p < 0.001), and treatment with digoxin did not affect CTS concentrations at 6-month follow-up. A range of CTS are detected in the circulation of patients with atrial fibrillation and heart failure. Within this randomised trial but limited by low circulating levels, CTS do not appear to interact with the ability of digoxin to improve wellbeing compared to conventional first-line treatment with beta-blockers.",

Traditional thermodynamic approaches often fail to capture its full dynamics. In this study, we apply non-equilibrium stochastic thermodynamics to analyze different stages of carcinogenesis: neoplastic transformation (using the Avrami-Dobrzyński approach), tumor growth (described by the Gompertz model), and metastasis, in relation to tumor entropy and self-organization. Our results reveal a relationship between entropy production and tumor expansion rate, indicating that cellular reproduction enhances entropy generation. We also examine the information entropy of hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that restricting external energy intake does not halt tumor progression, underscoring the resilience of cancer as an autonomous physical system. These findings highlight the thermodynamic nature of cancer and suggest that metastasis is an inevitable consequence of entropy-driven evolution.",

    "abstract": "The skeletal muscle plays a key role in thermogenesis and energy homeostasis in endotherms. Therefore, reduced skeletal muscle mass and function are closely associated with health disorders such as obesity and hypothermia. In humans, inactivity and nutritional deficiencies can lead to skeletal muscle atrophy. However, hibernating mammals, which can greatly suppress their metabolic rate, can maintain significant skeletal muscle mass even during prolonged periods of inactivity and nutritional restriction. This review focuses on how skeletal muscle contributes to maintaining body temperature as the organ that consumes the most energy, while also contributing to whole-organism homeostasis through its high metabolic flexibility in a self-sacrificing manner. Particularly, we reconceptualized muscle atrophy associated with the thermoregulatory process in terms of inter-organ metabolic interaction, proposing that sarcopenia is an integral component of systemic energy metabolism regulation. By deepening our understanding of the functional metabolic flexibility of skeletal muscle and its regulatory mechanisms, we can redefine sarcopenia as an adaptive response that contributes to maintaining metabolic homeostasis. This perspective could provide new insights into the pathophysiology of sarcopenia and metabolic disorders, and inform the development of more effective prevention and treatment strategies.",

    "title": "Celastrol delays the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma by suppressing SLC1A5-mediated glutamine dependence.",
    "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a serious public health problem worldwide due to its high mortality rate and specific therapeutic strategies with rare effective drugs. Glutamine, a critical nutrient for sustaining the cellular vital activities, has become a promising direction for HCC management. Celastrol is a terpenoids natural product isolated from the Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F. and catches attention for its multiple pharmacological activities including anti-HCC therapeutic potential. However, its effects in regulating glutamine metabolism to suppress HCC progression have not been investigated. In this study, Hep3B and HepG2 cells were used to investigate the inhibitory effects of celastrol on hepatoma cells. Subsequently, the biosafety and inhibitory effects of celastrol on tumor growth were investigated in a xenograft animal model of liver cancer. Our results showed that celastrol restrained the proliferation of hepatoma cells which was tightly associated with reduction of glutamine metabolic flux. Mechanistically, celastrol restricted glutamine uptake by inhibiting the SLC1A5 expression to reduce the content of glutamine metabolism intermediates in hepatoma cells thereby interrupting the energy source for cell proliferation. Consistently, similar results were observed in a transplanted HCC tumor mouse model. Interestingly, overexpression of SLC1A5 reversed the efficacy of celastrol in decreasing glutamine metabolic flux to suppress the malignant proliferation of hepatoma cells in vitro and in vivo. Overall, this study provides compelling evidence to demonstrate the efficacy of celastrol in inhibiting hepatocarcinogenesis by suppressing SLC1A5-mediated glutamine dependence, suggesting that celastrol as a natural active compound is expected to be developed as a therapeutic agent for HCC.",

    "abstract": "Caloric restriction (CR) extends the health and lifespan of diverse species. When fed once daily, CR-treated mice rapidly consume their food and endure a prolonged fast between meals. As fasting is associated with a rise in circulating ketone bodies, we investigated the role of ketogenesis in CR using mice with whole-body ablation of Hmgcs2, the rate-limiting enzyme producing the main ketone body β-hydroxybutyrate (βHB). Here, we report that Hmgcs2 is largely dispensable for many metabolic benefits of CR, including CR-driven changes in adiposity, glycemic control, liver autophagy, and energy balance. Although we observed sex-specific effects of Hmgcs2 on insulin sensitivity, fuel selection, and adipocyte gene expression, the overall physiological response to CR remained robust in mice lacking Hmgcs2. To gain insight into why the deletion of Hmgcs2 does not disrupt CR, we measured fasting βHB levels as mice initiated a CR diet. Surprisingly, as mice adapt to CR, they no longer engage in high levels of ketogenesis during the daily fast. Our work suggests that the metabolic benefits of long-term CR are not mediated by ketogenesis.",

    "abstract": "The primary concerning outcome in early onset scoliosis (EOS), pulmonary function, is challenging to measure in children. Surrogate measures, including thoracic length and curve magnitude, poorly predict patient outcomes. Activity capacity as determined by Metabolic Equivalents of Task (MET) is a potentially useful alternative or adjunct since it more directly reflects the tasks being performed. The objective of this pilot study was to assess MET values for varying intensity activities in children with EOS and explore their relationship to pulmonary function indices, scoliosis characteristics, and patient-reported outcome measures. For this pilot study, basal metabolic rate and physical activity MET values were measured using indirect calorimetry. MET values were assessed while performing video games representing low (bowling), moderate (boxing), and high intensity (active running) activities, and treadmill walking at low, moderate, and high intensity. MET values were compared to age-matched standardized energy expenditure values in youth (METy) for similar tasks. Pulmonary function testing was assessed using spirometry with percent predicted values based on arm span. Patient outcomes were obtained for each participant through the 24-question Early-Onset Scoliosis Questionnaire (EOSQ-24) and select assessments from the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS). A linear mixed model assessed differences between groups. Spearman correlation coefficients assessed relationships between variables. Eight children (ages 6-16y, 50% female) completed testing. Etiologies for scoliosis were congenital (n = 3), syndromic (n = 3), and idiopathic (n = 2). Five had spirometry suggestive of severe restriction (FVC and FEV MET values in children with EOS were directionally similar to values in normal children. Children unable to generate higher MET values appear to self-limit their activity. The relationship between MET and pulmonary function is complex and requires further exploration. Children with EOS and pulmonary impairment appear unable to generate the energy required for more vigorous activities. This could be due to poor pulmonary function, deconditioning from their underlying condition, or limitations in the tested video games. II.",

Place and Duration of the Study: Department of Endocrinology, the First College of Clinical Medical Science, China Three Gorges University, Yichang Central People's Hospital, Hubei, China, from December 2024 to April 2025. Data were obtained from 11,176 eligible adults who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) conducted from 1999 to 2006. The sarcopenia index (SI) was computed as the ratio of appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM, kg), measured using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, to body mass index (BMI, kg/m2). The cohort was stratified into quartiles based on the SI (Q1-Q4). Mortality follow-up lasted until December 31, 2019. A multivariable Cox proportional hazards model was used to evaluate the association between the SI and all-cause mortality. Non-linear relationships were assessed using restricted cubic splines, and subgroup analyses were performed to assess effect modification. After accounting for demographic, socio-economic, lifestyle, and clinical factors, there was an inverse, non-linear relationship between SI and all-cause mortality. Specifically, the mortality risk in the Q4 group (highest SI quartile) was 24% lower than in the Q1 group (lowest SI quartile; p <0.05). In participants with metabolic abnormalities, such as overweight/obese, hypertension, or impaired glucose metabolism, higher SI was significantly linked to reduced mortality. Moreover, using the Kaplan-Meier analysis, the Q4 group featured the best prognosis, while the Q1 group had the lowest survival rate. Sarcopenia, assessed by the SI, has a significant correlation with all-cause mortality. Moreover, a strong association between them was observed in populations with metabolic abnormalities.

    "abstract": "Reproduction is tightly linked to nutrient availability and metabolic homeostasis, yet how specific metabolic pathways coordinate with cellular signaling to control oogenesis remains unclear. Through a targeted RNAi screen in the Drosophila germline, we identify Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase (Acc), the rate-limiting enzyme in fatty acid synthesis (FAS), as an essential regulator of germline stem cell (GSC) maintenance and oocyte development. Acc loss shifts cellular metabolism toward fatty acid oxidation (FAO), fueling the TCA cycle and electron transport chain, which elevates ATP levels and hyperactivates TOR signaling. This metabolic reprogramming induces excessive protein synthesis, disrupting endosomal trafficking and fusome branching, a germline-specific organelle essential for synchronized cell divisions and oocyte selection. These defects are rescued by inhibiting FAO, suppressing TOR activity, reducing protein synthesis, or restricting dietary protein intake. Our study establishes a direct metabolic-signaling-structural axis in the female germline and highlights Acc as a key metabolic checkpoint that safeguards energy balance, intracellular trafficking, and oocyte fate.",

    "title": "Decoding the Spectrum of Anorexia Nervosa: Clinical Impact, Molecular Insights, and Therapeutic Perspectives.",
    "abstract": "Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a severe psychiatric disorder with the highest mortality rate among mental illnesses, characterized by an intense fear of weight gain, persistent restriction of energy intake, and a distorted perception of body image. Despite decades of investigation, the pathogenesis of AN is only partially understood and is recognized as multifactorial, involving genetic, sociocultural, and neurobiological determinants. Beyond its core psychopathological features, AN leads to a wide spectrum of systemic complications, including cardiovascular, renal, skeletal, and endocrine dysfunctions. Increasing evidence implicates autophagy and oxidative stress as key molecular mechanisms underpinning its pathophysiology, while growing attention has been directed toward immune dysregulation and alterations in the gut-brain axis as potential mediators of disease onset and progression. Therapeutic advances, however, remain limited. Current management relies primarily on nutritional rehabilitation and psychotherapeutic interventions, while treatment outcomes are constrained by high relapse rates and the lack of pharmacological agents with proven efficacy. In this context, a more comprehensive understanding of the clinical spectrum and molecular substrates of AN is essential to improving prognosis and guiding the development of novel therapeutic strategies. This narrative review synthesizes current evidence on the non-psychopathological dimensions of AN, encompassing its clinical manifestations, systemic complications, and implicated molecular pathways. It also appraises existing treatment modalities and examines emerging interventions with translational potential. Overall, this review aims to provide clinicians and researchers with an updated and integrative overview of AN, shedding light on novel directions in ongoing research.",

    "abstract": "Phase separation of biomolecular condensates promotes membrane-free compartmentalization in cells. The dynamics of these biocondensates is routinely regulated by energy-consuming processes. Here, we devise a theory pinpointing how active chemical reactions, interconverting molecules between phase-separating and inert forms, can drive faster condensate coarsening. We find that mass conservation limits droplet volume growth to being linear in time regardless of activity, resembling the passive Lifshitz-Slyozov law. However, if reactions are restricted to occur only outside droplets, the rate of Ostwald ripening can be increased by an arbitrarily large factor. In support of our theory, recent ripening experiments under fueled interconversion reactions offer promising evidence for the realizability of accelerated coarsening. We posit that the ability to induce rapid biocondensate coarsening can be advantageous in synthetic-biological contexts, e.g., as a regulator of metabolic channeling.",

Human bifunctional 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate synthase 1 (hPAPSS1) directly synthesizes PAPS in two sequential steps, circumventing the inefficiencies of multienzyme systems. However, unsatisfactory ATP substrate affinity and catalytic activity restrict its applications in the biosynthesis of sulfonyl compounds. Herein, a semirational design strategy was employed to enhance its activity, resulting in a positive combinatorial variant, hPAPSS1-C207G/F560W, which exhibited a 2.22-fold increase in activity and achieved a PAPS conversion rate of 34.45%. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the C207G substitution enhanced the flexibility of the C-loop, thereby improving its turnover rate. Concurrently, the F560W mutation optimized the conformations of key residues and reduced the binding free energy, enhancing its binding affinity for ATP. This study uncovered two bottleneck issues in enzyme activity and demonstrated mechanisms underlying the hPAPSS1 catalytic performance, enabling efficient synthesis of PAPS.",

    "abstract": "Bladder cancer ranks among the top four most common malignancies in men worldwide. Despite therapeutic advancements, metastatic cases remain associated with dismal survival rates, highlighting the critical importance of studying environmental carcinogenic factors such as 4-aminobiphenyl (4-ABP). Classified as a Group 1 carcinogen by IARC, this compound-found in tobacco smoke and industrial chemicals-induces DNA damage through aryl amine metabolism. However, its cell-type-specific molecular mechanisms in bladder carcinogenesis remain poorly characterized, particularly at single-cell resolution. Our study combined single-cell RNA sequencing data (n = 95,136 cells) with publicly available bulk transcriptomic datasets from the GEO repository. The computational workflow incorporated Harmony algorithm for batch effect correction, WGCNA for co-expression network construction, and a machine learning framework utilizing LASSO, SVM, and Random Forest algorithms for biomarker identification. Additionally, we performed molecular docking simulations to investigate 4-ABP-protein interactions and employed ssGSEA to characterize immune cell infiltration patterns in the tumor microenvironment. Single-cell profiling uncovered distinct fibroblast and mast cell subpopulations exhibiting significant 4-ABP-associated transcriptional signatures (adjusted p = 2.22 × 10 Through integrated multi-omics analyses, this investigation systematically elucidates 4-ABP's carcinogenic mechanisms while identifying clinically actionable biomarkers and molecular targets for precision medicine applications in bladder cancer prevention and treatment. These findings provide critical insights for developing targeted strategies to mitigate environmental carcinogenesis in susceptible populations. However, this study is limited by its retrospective nature and reliance on public sequencing data, which restricted access to detailed clinical metadata and precluded survival analysis for the identified subtypes.",

    "abstract": "Polymer films are extensively used in biomedical applications, but their limited surface properties often restrict their functional performance. Non-thermal plasma treatment offers a clean and efficient strategy to modify the surface characteristics without altering the material's bulk properties. In this work, Cur/PVA and Cur/Ch films were surface-modified using Dielectric Barrier Discharge (DBD) plasma at 25 kV with argon as discharge gas. Experimental characterizations confirmed significant alterations in the surface properties after plasma treatment. Among the samples, plasma-treated Cur/Ch PT15 films exhibited better antibacterial activity against E. coli with an inhibition zone of 16 ± 0.3 mm and demonstrated a reduced drug release rate of 35.3 ± 2.3 %, indicating sustained release behavior. To understand the molecular mechanisms behind these enhancements, Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations were performed. The plasma-treated Cur/Ch complex showed the lowest energy gap of 2.30 eV and the highest dipole moment of 8.09 Debye, indicating enhanced reactivity, polarity and stronger intermolecular interactions. The theoretical results correlated well with the experimental observations, confirming that plasma treatment induces favorable electronic modifications that contribute to improved antibacterial efficacy and drug retention. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of plasma-modified Cur/Ch films as promising candidates for biomedical applications such as antibacterial applications and sustained drug delivery systems.",

Both groups had reductions in total and HDL cholesterol and triglyceride and maintained LDL. IER and CER have comparable reductions in weight and ectopic fat stores, fat free mass and RMR and lipids. The clinical significance of the failure to maintain beneficial insulin sensitivity across the week with IER is not known and requires further study. ISRCTN 10,803,394 Registration date 12/01/2015.

    "title": "Reduced dietary intake induces body fluid hypotonicity via alterations in water and energy metabolism.",
    "abstract": "Maintenance of the body's fluid balance is essential for vital human functions. Although drinking water is widely recommended, the role of dietary intake in body fluids remains unclear. This study investigated whether overnight dietary restriction with adequate water consumption affects body water balance, its regulatory responses, and thermoregulatory and cognitive functions during exercise in a hot environment. Fifteen young adults experienced two conditions: sufficient meal intake (CON) and small dinner with skipped breakfast (RED), both with adequate controlled water consumption. Blood and urine samples, as well as indices of systemic circulation, thermoregulatory responses and cognitive functions, were obtained before, during and after a 60 min moderate-intensity treadmill exercise. RED induced lower serum osmolality and urine sodium excretion compared with CON (both P < 0.05), suggesting the development of body fluid hypotonicity with impaired urinary concentrating capacity. Water- and electrolyte-regulating hormone levels remained unchanged in RED (all P > 0.05). Systemic circulation and thermoregulatory responses (heart rate, blood pressure, skin blood flow and sweat rate) remained comparable between the conditions, leading to similar core body and skin surface temperature elevations (all P > 0.05). Moreover, cognitive performance (Go/No-Go, Stroop, reaction time and digit span tasks) was not changed in RED (all P > 0.05). Notably, RED increased oxygen uptake with a reduced respiratory quotient during exercise (both P < 0.05), indicating a metabolic shift toward lipid oxidation. These findings suggest that overnight dietary restriction induces body fluid hypotonicity with altered water and energy metabolism. KEY POINTS: Dietary intake provides substrates essential for water and osmotic balances, yet its role in maintaining hydration remains underexplored. This study assessed whether overnight dietary restriction (RED), with adequate water intake, induces dehydration and affects body functions during exercise in heat. RED induced body fluid hypotonicity, as evidenced by lower serum osmolality and sodium excretion, without changes in body weight or urine volume before and after exercise. RED led to reduced urinary concentrating capacity during exercise, which may reflect changes in the reabsorption of electrolytes and water in the renal tubules.",

    "abstract": "Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is characterized by an abnormal increase in heart rate upon standing, leading to symptoms such as dizziness, fatigue, and rapid heart rate. Time-restricted eating (TRE), which limits caloric intake to an 8-10 h daily window, has been shown to decrease inflammation and improve immune, autonomic, and mitochondrial function, as well as cardiometabolic parameters. This single arm pilot study evaluated the effects of TRE on quality of life (QOL), heart rate, and mitochondrial function in 20 participants with POTS (≥ 30 bpm increase in upright heart rate) and a baseline dietary window of ≥ 12 h. Following a 2-week baseline monitoring period, participants underwent a 12-week TRE intervention. Pre- and post-intervention assessments included QOL questionnaires, a 10-minute stand test, and plasma mitochondrial analysis. TRE significantly reduced heart rate increase upon standing (mean decrease: 11 bpm, p < 0.001) and improved QOL metrics, as assessed by the Malmö POTS Symptom Score Survey (MAPS) and the General Health Questionnaire Short Form-36 (SF-36). Notable improvements include POTS symptom severity (p < 0.0001), physical functioning (p = 0.02), and energy/fatigue (p < 0.01). Additionally TRE increased mitochondrial-derived ATP production. These findings suggest TRE as a promising lifestyle intervention to improve QOL, heart rate, and mitochondrial function in POTS patients.",

In the present study, we examined the effect of time-restricted feeding (TRF) on lactating striped hamsters. On the day of litter birth, lactating females were assigned into 3 experimental groups that experienced 24-h ad lib feeding (Con), 12-h daytime feeding (DF), or 12-h nighttime feeding (NF). A group of non-lactating females with 24-h feeding (NL) served as an additional control. Our data show that lactating females had increased food intake, oxygen consumption, and small intestine mass but a decreased level of circulating melatonin, compared to the NL females. However, TRF manipulation significantly reduced the mother's food intake, the pup's body mass, and survival rate. In addition, TRF had some phase-specific (i.e., DF vs. NF) effects on facilitating body mass loss, decreasing ",

Research objective: This experiment aims to conduct a feeding test by selecting 40 Holstein dairy cows and randomly dividing them into 2 groups, with 20 cows in each group and 20 replicates in each group, and one cow in each replicate. The effects of reducing dietary protein levels, adding RP-Lys and RP-Met on rumen microbial diversity, nitrogen metabolism and different metabolites in feces and urine of dairy cows were investigated by using 16S rDNA and metabolomics. To provide a certain theoretical basis for guiding dairy cows to save protein feed production. Low protein amino acid balanced diet had no significant effect on rumen fermentation parameters such as rumen pH, NH Adding protective rumen lysine and methionine to low-protein diets has no significant effect on rumen fermentation parameters such as pH, NH3-N, acetic acid and propionic acid, and has positive significance for maintaining the structural stability of rumen microbiota. It can reduce nitrogen excretion and improve nitrogen utilization efficiency, which is in line with the current development concept of green breeding and provides a scientific basis for reducing breeding pollution and optimizing resource utilization. And by regulating the metabolism of L-try and L-ala, it affects protein digestion and absorption, energy supply and rumen microbiota, laying a theoretical foundation for further improving the nutritional supply system of ruminants and enhancing production performance, and has extremely high practical guiding value.",

    "title": "Hepatic ketogenic insufficiency blunts exercise-induced energy expenditure and alters mitochondrial proteins in skeletal muscle.",
    "abstract": "Ketone body (KB) utilization increases during fasting and exercise due to enhanced hepatic fatty acid oxidation and KB production via the rate-limiting mitochondrial enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase (HMGCS2). Since KB metabolism intersects with multiple metabolic pathways, and skeletal muscle KB catabolism rises during exercise, we tested the hypothesis that liver-specific HMGCS2 knockouts (KO) would have reduced energy expenditure (EE) and changes in the mitochondrial proteome of skeletal muscle with chronic exercise through voluntary wheel running (VWR), time-restricted feeding (TRF), or both combined to boost hepatic KB production and utilization. Control (CON) and HMGCS2 knockout (KO) mice (n=6-8 per group) underwent sedentary ad libitum feeding (SED+AL), SED+TRF, VWR+AL, and VWR+TRF for 16 weeks, with whole-body EE measured using indirect calorimetry. In CON mice, VWR increased total EE by 19.5% and non-resting EE by 50% under AL conditions, and total EE by 16% and non-resting EE by 47.9% under TRF conditions. However, the EE increases seen with VWR did not occur in KO mice. Proteomic analysis revealed that the loss of liver HMGCS2 significantly impacted proteins involved in metabolic processes within skeletal muscle, including reduced oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) protein expression in SED KO mice compared to sedentary CON. Notably, VWR restored OXPHOS protein expression in the muscle of the liver HMGCS2 KO but did not alter it in the CON. Furthermore, muscle from liver HMGCS2 KO mice had elevated expression glycolytic pathways in sedentary and VWR conditions. These results indicate that hepatic ketogenic deficiency (HMGCS2 KO) diminishes exercise-induced increases in EE and uniquely impacts baseline and exercise-related adaptations in the metabolic and mitochondrial proteome of skeletal muscle.",

Cross-sectional observational study with machine learning-based risk modelling. Tertiary hospital in eastern China, secondary care level. A total of 670 hospitalised RA patients (135 males and 535 females; aged 58.00 (50.00-67.00) years; disease duration 8.00 (2.00-16.00) years) and 126 healthy controls were recruited between October 2019 and October 2022. There were no differences in basic indicators such as gender, age distribution and body mass index between the two groups. RA diagnosis followed American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 1987 or ACR/European League Against Rheumatism 2010 criteria. Exclusion criteria included major organ dysfunction, endocrine disease, infection or long-term hormone or psychotropic drug use. Primary outcomes included total skeletal muscle mass, fat mass, FMR measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis and bone mineral density measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Secondary outcomes included RA disease activity scores (clinical disease activity index (CDAI), simplified disease activity index, disease activity score in 28 joints (DAS28)) and glucocorticoid use. Logistic regression and four additional machine learning algorithms were used to build predictive models for OP. The RA group (age, 58.00; duration, 8.00; DAS28, 5.03; rheumatoid factor, 104.75; C-reactive protein, 25.65; erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), 59.00) exhibited reduced total skeletal muscle mass (19.49 vs 25.38, p<0.001), hip bone mineral density (0.90 vs 1.15, p<0.001) and L1-4 bone mineral density (0.86 vs 1.08, p<0.001), alongside increased total fat mass (18.33 vs 16.37, p=0.020) and FMR (0.98 vs 0.68, p<0.001). Total fat mass was positively correlated with simplified and CDAI (p<0.001). Total skeletal muscle mass was negatively correlated with ESR (p=0.001) and positively correlated with both L1-4 and hip bone mineral density (p<0.001). FMR showed a positive correlation with clinical disease activity index (p<0.001). There were significant differences in total fat mass and FMR among RA patients with varying disease activity levels (p<0.001). RA patients with concomitant OP or using glucocorticoids had a higher total fat mass and FMR than their respective control groups, with only total skeletal muscle mass levels being lower (p<0.01). We developed predictive models using multiple machine learning algorithms, which identified that both age and FMR were key factors associated with secondary OP in RA patients. Subgroup analysis identified an interaction effect between FMR and gender and restricted cubic spline fitted the dose-response relationship between FMR and OP. FMR may serve as a useful clinical indicator of secondary OP in RA patients. A model based on FMR and associated risk factors can predict the possibility of secondary OP.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial bioenergetic competency in cells is frequently assessed by the Mito Stress Test protocol, which includes uncoupler addition for evaluating respiratory capacity. The uncoupled oxygen consumption rate (OCR) is usually defined as maximal respiration, with little consideration of whether the measured rate is restricted by substrate supply. In this study, we show that the uncoupled OCR is substrate-limited in rat primary cortical neurons and isolated mouse forebrain synaptosomes. We use a different respirometry protocol we name CRABS-ROC (Complex Respirometry Assay Bypassing Substrate-Restricted Oxygen Consumption) that enables evaluation of individual electron transport chain (ETC) complex capacities using saturating levels of substrates to bypass this restriction. Optimization of the cytochrome c concentration was critical for ETC complex capacity assessment. Applying CRABS-ROC to primary cortical neurons reveals >2-fold excess Complex I capacity beyond the uncoupled OCR of cells metabolizing glucose and pyruvate. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CRABS-ROC can expose a Complex I deficit in isolated harlequin mutant brain mitochondria that display wild-type levels of Complex I-substrate-linked respiration despite having about half the normal level of Complex I. Thus, CRABS-ROC should be broadly useful for studies on mitochondrial function because it can both reveal excess ETC capacity and unmask ETC alterations that may be missed by the most widely used methods.",

    "title": "Targeting glucose transporters in parkinson's disease: a novel metabolic approach for disease modification.",
    "abstract": "Glucose metabolism is vital for maintaining the effective functioning of the central nervous system (CNS). This energy supports synaptic activity, ion balance, and neurotransmitter synthesis, processes that depend on the GLUTs (glucose transporters), particularly GLUT1(Glucose transporter 1), GLUT2(Glucose transporter 2), and GLUT3 (Glucose transporter 3). There is growing evidence associating GLUT deficiency and metabolic disorders with neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease (PD). PD is a progressive neurodegenerative disease linked with the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the SNpc, resulting in impaired motor and non-motor functions. More than 60% of patients with PD show glucose intolerance and insulin resistance, emphasizing the relation between metabolic disturbances and disease progression. The reduced expression of these GLUTs further restricts the neuronal glucose uptake, impairing ATP production and increasing liability to oxidative damage, leading to disease progression. Emerging finding suggests that targeting GLUT offers a therapeutic strategy for PD. Restoring GLUT function may help to reduce energy deficits and have neuroprotective effects. Several antidiabetic drugs have shown promise in reducing the symptoms and development of PD in both human and animal models. This narrative review addresses the current understanding of the connection between GLUT dysfunction and PD, highlighting the potential of targeting GLUT dysregulation as a novel therapeutic strategy. Additionally, repurposing antidiabetic drugs shows promise in improving insulin sensitivity and reducing neuroinflammation in PD. Addressing challenges like GLUT isoform specificity and BBB penetration provides a way for disease-modifying therapies that target GLUT dysfunction in PD, offering hope for effective management or reducing the rate of PD's progression.",

    "abstract": "The health benefits of metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) are associated with improvements in comorbidities and reduction in their incidence and mortality rates. Food restriction and anatomical changes result in a higher risk of nutritional complications and must be considered. This study aimed to evaluate the difference in adherence and daily protein intake between a protein liquid supplementation (PLS) versus a conventional protein powder (PPS) in patients undergoing (MBS). A 2-month parallel, randomized, controlled trial including 50 patients (PLS n = 15; PPS n = 35) undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (GBP) was conducted. Body composition (bioimpedance analysis), resting energy expenditure (indirect calorimetry), and nutritional status (serum levels of macronutrients and micronutrients) were evaluated before pre- and post-operatively. Dietary protein intake and supplementation adherence were monitored every 15 days. Weight loss and changes in fat-free mass were comparable between the two groups after GBP (PLS: - 12.9 ± 4.8 vs. PPS: - 14.5 ± 6.3) (p > 0.05), (PLS: - 12.5 ± 3.7 vs. PPS: - 11.2 ± 3.3) (p > 0.05), respectively. The PLS group showed a higher basal metabolic rate at 2 months (PLS: 1843.4 ± 278.3 vs. PPS: 1642.2 ± 249.8) (p < 0.05). Adherence to the PLS group (102.7 ± 77.2%) was higher than the PPS group (42.0 ± 23.7%) (p = 0.012). Prevalence of 25OH-vitamin D deficiency and abnormal transferrin saturation were (PLS: 28.6% vs. PPS: 90% p < 0.001), (PLS: 8.3% vs. PPS: 57.1% p = 0.037), respectively. A protein liquid supplementation appears to be an alternative in achieving the protein recommendations after GBP and may facilitate dietary adherence while reducing the incidence of nutritional deficiencies.

    "title": "Effects of Acute Time-Restricted Eating on Inflammation in Individuals With Psoriasis: Protocol for a Case-Control, Prospective Study.",
    "abstract": "Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory disease associated with multiple comorbidities, including metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease. Although specific dietary interventions, such as intermittent fasting and caloric restriction, have been shown to ameliorate inflammation and promote weight loss, the effect of these interventions independent of weight loss remains unclear. Time-restricted eating (TRE), a type of intermittent fasting, limits the daily eating window to a fixed number of hours. Recent studies suggest TRE may improve immune function in individuals with metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular risk factors. A crucial advantage of TRE over other investigated dietary restriction strategies is its reported high adherence rate, making it a more feasible intervention for long-term use. Therefore, exploring the effects of TRE on metabolic and immunological parameters in psoriasis is warranted. This study was designed to evaluate the effects of short-term, isocaloric TRE, independent of weight loss, on immune cell function and serum metabolite profiles of volunteers with mild-to-moderate psoriasis compared to healthy individuals. This case-control, prospective study was performed on 10 healthy male participants and 10 age-, BMI-, and sex-matched individuals with mild-to-moderate psoriasis. All individuals with psoriasis had stable disease and were being treated with topical therapies without any exposure to immunomodulatory biologics. This study was conducted at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center. Immune profiles, glucose handling, energy expenditure, and participants' weights were assessed at baseline and after 3 days of TRE following a daily 6-hour eating window and 18-hour fast. The trial commenced in June 2021 and was completed in February 2023. A total of 20 participants were enrolled-10 with mild-to-moderate psoriasis and 10 age-, BMI-, and sex-matched healthy individuals. As of the time of manuscript submission, data processing is ongoing. Multiomic datasets, including gene expression, surface and intracellular protein levels, and metabolite profiles, are being generated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, CD4 This clinical protocol was designed to characterize the effects of short term (3-day) TRE on psoriasis, independent of weight loss, by comparing immune cell regulatory responses between healthy individuals and those with psoriasis. More specifically, we aim to map the molecular pathways activated by TRE and assess how they affect immune cell composition, activation, and metabolism. Additionally, components of the metabolic response to isocaloric TRE are being explored. Insights into how dietary interventions impact metabolism and the immune system will enhance our understanding of the pathogenesis of psoriasis and may reveal new therapeutic avenues for managing this inflammatory condition.

    "title": "Impact of intermittent fasting on sleep physiology: A prospective observational study using smartwatch technology.",
    "abstract": "Time-restricted eating (TRE) following a 16:8 pattern is a popular form of intermittent fasting with established metabolic benefits. However, its impact on sleep and physical activity remains unclear, particularly when assessed using wearable technologies. This study investigated the short-term effects of TRE on sleep physiology and activity levels by using a commercially available smartwatch. In this prospective observational study, 35 healthy adults (mean age, 30 years; 66% female) completed a 3-day baseline phase, followed by 7 days of a 16:8 TRE regimen. Objective data on sleep, heart rate, and activity were continuously recorded using Withings ScanWatch. Subjective sleep quality, including the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, was assessed pre- and postintervention. Statistical analyses were performed using paired t tests. No significant changes were observed in total sleep duration, light or deep sleep, sleep latency, or nocturnal awakenings between baseline and fasting periods. The daily step count, energy expenditure, and heart rate parameters remained stable. A nonsignificant trend towards slightly reduced deep sleep was noted, which is consistent with the results of previous studies. Subjective sleep assessments reflected objective data, with most participants reporting no perceived changes in sleep quality during intermittent fasting. Short-term 16:8 intermittent fasting did not significantly affect the sleep physiology, physical activity, or heart rate in healthy adults. The subjective and objective measures were closely aligned. These findings support those of previous reviews suggesting that TRE does not influence sleep architecture in healthy populations. Further studies are needed in metabolically at-risk cohorts over longer durations.",

    "abstract": "Nuchal humps are morphological traits that occur among vertebrate species and have multiple functions. The emergence of nuchal humps in Xiphophorus multilineatus males maintained in the laboratory, a species that does not develop humps in the wild, provided a unique opportunity to explore the development and function of this trait. The current study investigated the tissue composition of the hump and analyzed the influence of rearing temperature and diet restriction on hump development. Through histological examination and gene expression profiling, our findings show that the hump is composed primarily of adipose tissue, which suggests a role in energy storage via fat deposition. Nuchal humps grew to a larger size in the cold environment (20 °C) than in the warm (25 °C), and the differential gene expression pattern between temperature treatments suggests increased fat deposition in the cold versus the warm environment. For example, the G0S2 gene, which inhibits lipid catabolism, is upregulated in the cold environment, and the WARS-1 gene, which leads to increased fat stores when under-expressed, is upregulated in the warm environment. The hypothesis that temperature influences hump development by stimulating shifts in fat metabolism is further supported by the finding that males from the warm environment used fat stores in the nuchal hump at a faster rate when placed on a restricted diet than males from the cold. The influence of temperature, diet, and potentially activity levels on fat deposition suggests X. multilineatus as an evolutionary animal model for gaining insights into the mechanisms involved in human obesity.",

    "title": "From plateau to plains: unraveling the diet-exercise paradox in uric acid homeostasis through a comprehensive comparative study.",
    "abstract": "To examine differences in serum uric acid (SUA) concentrations and hyperuricemia prevalence between residents of high- versus low-altitude regions, and determine the major contributing factors to such variations, we conducted a comparative study to investigate the prevalence and influencing factors of individuals living in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and low-altitude areas from two time periods. In this comparative cross-sectional study, individuals living in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (101 individuals) and low-altitude areas (502 individuals) from two periods (March to August 2021 and March to August 2022) were recruited to participate and complete questionnaires assessing anthropometric measurements (BMI), physical activity levels, smoking and alcohol consumption habits, and dietary preferences. Individuals living in high-altitude areas had significantly higher rate of high uric acid levels, accounting for 56.43%, comparing to those living in low-altitude areas alone (5.38%). Our results demonstrated that excessive intake of urate-producing foods, which may lead to overweight and obesity, and inability to eliminate the uric acid produced through exercise may be one of the important reasons for the higher proportion of mechanically ventilated patients in plateau areas. Factors of body mass index, night snacks, beans, and smoking have significant effects on uric acid levels when comparing individuals living in high- and low-altitude areas. This study identifies significant altitude-dependent variations in SUA regulation, primarily mediated through dietary patterns and energy metabolism. The protective factors observed at high altitudes, such as restricted purine intake and increased physical activity, offer valuable epidemiological evidence for developing targeted prevention strategies against hyperuricemia in low-altitude populations. Key Points • High-altitude residents exhibited 10.5-fold higher hyperuricemia prevalence than low-altitude counterparts (56.43% vs. 5.38%, p < 0.001), revealing profound environmental modulation of uric acid metabolism. Excessive intake of high-purine foods coupled with insufficient energy metabolism due to physical inactivity may contribute significantly to the high prevalence of hyperuricemia in low-altitude regions. • The findings offer robust epidemiological evidence to support the development of targeted prevention strategies for hyperuricemia in low-altitude region.",

    "abstract": "Bamboo is an excellent raw material for papermaking, offering advantages such as a simple papermaking process, abundant availability, short growth cycle, and significant ecological effect. However, the lignin content in bamboo greatly restricts its effective utilization of bamboo pulp. In this study, a strain of SF-6, an efficient ligninolytic bacterium, was screened from bamboo rat feces under restrictive culture conditions and identified as Enterobacter sichuanensis by 16S rDNA. The main factors affecting the fermentation of SF-6 was determined by a one-way test, and the optimal culture temperature of the strain was 36.8 °C. The inoculum amount and pH value were determined by response surface analysis. The optimum culture temperature was 36.8 °C, the inoculum amount was 7.5%, and the initial pH was 5.2. Under these conditions, the decomposition rate of lignin was 38.59%, which was 55.42% higher than that before optimization, the paper tear resistance was improved by 73.2%, the breakage strength was improved by 62.41%, and the amount of alkali used was only 1.5 times that of the traditional chemical method. In conclusion, bamboo pulping with SF-6 resulted in a good pulping performance, less energy consumption, and no harm to the environment. Therefore, this is a feasible preparation method. This study provides a new microbial source for lignin degradation.",

A high-rate activated sludge (HRAS) process coupled a single-stage partial nitritation/anammox-hydroxyapatite (PN/A-HAP) process was developed to treat swine manure digestate. The coupled processes achieved stable removal efficiencies of 92 % (N), 63 % (P), and 66 % (chemical oxygen demand, COD), respectively. The HRAS process reduced the five-day biological oxygen demand/COD ratio to 0.31, effectively mitigating the organic stress of anammox process. The synergistic effect of HAP crystallization and external forces induced structural fragmentation of PN/A-HAP granules. The HAP microcrystals in fragmented sludge (<100 μm) function as nucleation cores, driving PN/A-HAP granules reformation. Ca.

    "abstract": "Overweight and obesity are increasing global challenges associated with severe health risks. Lifestyle factors like easy access to high-caloric foods and a decrease in physical activity contribute to weight gain. The increase in fat mass (FM) and decrease in lean body mass (LBM) are supported by age-related changes in body composition by the age of 30. Two dietary strategies, the volumetrics diet (VD) and time-restricted eating (TRE), have shown promise in achieving sustainable loss of body weight (BW) and FM without requiring food group exclusions or portion reductions. This study aimed to compare the impact of VD and TRE on body composition parameters and their adherence rate in middle-aged normal-weight to overweight physically active people over 12 weeks. In this randomized controlled trial, 37 physically active participants were allocated to either VD or TRE (VD: n = 21, age: 39.48 ± 8.83 years, body mass index (BMI): 25,38 ± 4.37 kg/m Both VD and TRE groups showed significant reductions in BW (p = 0.0002; d = 0.61), absolute FM (p < 0.0001; d = 0.85), relative FM (p < 0.0001; d = 0.84), BMI (p = 0.0001; d = 0.60), WC (p < 0.0001; d = 0.92), HC (p = 0.003; d = 0.51) and WHR (p < 0.0001; d = 0.90) after 12 weeks. No significant differences were observed between groups or in interaction effects for these parameters. Both groups maintained LBM throughout the intervention. Adherence rates were significantly higher in TRE (5.78 ± 1.13 days/week) compared to VD (5.29 ± 1.49 days/week; p = 0.0002). Adherence declined over time in both groups but not significantly. Dietary analysis showed no significant differences in energy and macronutrient intake. VD led to the same results as TRE but with a significantly lower adherence rate in the 12-week intervention period. Both dietary approaches reduced BW and FM and maintained LBM in middle-aged, physically active individuals without changing physical activity levels. Therefore, VD and TRE may counteract age-related body composition changes as long-term measures. Further studies with larger samples and a longer study duration are needed to confirm these findings.

Identifying safe and effective nonpharmacologic and nonsurgical interventions to achieve a healthier body weight is essential. Scoping review of observational studies and randomized control trials. Adults aged ≥18 years with a body mass index (BMI) ≥30 kg/m Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR), we systematically searched 2 electronic databases (MEDLINE and Embase) for studies that examined the effect of nonpharmacologic and nonsurgical interventions for weight loss between January 2010-July 2024. Outcomes included weight loss and BMI. We also examined adherence, whether participants were involved in the design of the study, and adverse events. Two reviewers screened relevant citations and extracted study characteristics and outcomes. Discrepancies were resolved by a third reviewer. Study data were summarized descriptively following guidance from the PRISMA-ScR.

Interventions included exercise programs, dietary therapy, and/or cognitive behavioral therapy with follow-up ranging from 3-12 months. It appeared that dietary intervention that promoted significant caloric restriction over the short term led to the most weight loss (average, 7 kg). Interventions with monitored coaching appeared helpful. No adverse events were reported. None of the studies involved participants as partners. Not all studies included participants' estimated glomerular filtration rate or BMI category, and we may have included some without severe CKD or BMI ≥30 kg/m Programs encouraging very low-energy diets along with monitored coaching, may result in modest short-term weight loss. Patient views on these programs and their longer term success remain unclear.",

    "abstract": "The in vivo continuous evolution system OrthoRep (orthogonal replication) is a powerful strategy for rapid enzyme evolution in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that diversifies genes at a rate exceeding the endogenous genome mutagenesis rate by several orders of magnitude. However, it is difficult to neofunctionalize genes using OrthoRep partly because of the way selection pressures are applied. Here we combine OrthoRep with optogenetics in a selection strategy we call OptoRep, which allows fine-tuning of selection pressure with light. With this capability, we evolved a truncated form of the endogenous monocarboxylate transporter JEN1 (JEN1t) into a de novo mevalonate importer. We demonstrate the functionality of the evolved JEN1t (JEN1t",

    "abstract": "Deficiency in the short-chain enoyl-CoA hydratase 1 (ECHS1) gene causes Leigh syndrome (LS), a rare inherited metabolic disorder. Despite LS that arises as a result of inborn errors of energy metabolism, the specific contributions of ECHS1 deficiency to energy metabolism processes, developmental delay, and its mediated signaling mechanism remain unclear. Here, we identify a novel compound heterozygous variant [c.724G > A (p.Glu242Lys) and c.865G > A (Asp289Asn)] in the ECHS1 gene from a family of Han Chinese descent, with the affected individual displaying typical LS symptoms. The ECHS1 variants exhibit reduced 2-enoyl-CoA hydratase activity, resulting in a restricted ATP production rate, but the cellular ATP levels remains unchanged. ECHS1 deficiency also decreases cell viability and proliferation. Mechanistically, ECHS1 interacts with ADRB2, and its variants suppress the ADRB2/protein kinase A (PKA) signaling. Treatment with PKA signaling agonists or overexpression of PKA subunits in ECHS1-deficient cells can rescue the ATP production rate and restore cell viability. Additionally, the mitochondrial E3 ligase MUL1 mediates the ubiquitylation and degradation of ECHS1 protein variants. In conclusion, our study suggests that ECHS1 deficiency impairs mitochondrial respiratory efficiency, thereby lowering the ATP production rate, and reveals a promising therapeutic approach by targeting ADRB2/PKA signaling to combat ECHS1 deficiency-induced LS.",

    "abstract": "Compensated cirrhosis due to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (CC-MASLD) increases morbidity and mortality risk but has no aetiology-specific treatment. We investigated the safety and efficacy signals of severe energy restriction. In this randomised controlled trial, adults with CC-MASLD and obesity in a tertiary hepatology centre were randomised 2:1 to receive one-to-one remote dietetic support with a low-energy (880 kcal/day, 80 g protein/day) total diet replacement programme for 12 weeks and stepped food reintroduction for another 12 weeks or standard of care (SoC). Given the exploratory nature of the study, three pre-defined co-primary outcomes were used to assess safety and efficacy signals: severe increases in liver biochemistry, changes in iron-corrected T1, and changes in liver stiffness on magnetic resonance elastography. Changes in liver steatosis on magnetic resonance imaging, physical performance based on the physical performance test and liver frailty index, and changes in fat-free mass were secondary outcomes. Magnetic resonance outcomes were assessed blind. Between February 2022 and September 2023, 17 participants (36% female, median [IQR] age 58 [7.5] years) were randomised to SoC (n = 6) or intervention (n = 11). The trial stopped earlier than planned due to slow recruitment rate. 91% and 94% of participants completed the intervention and attended the 24-week follow-up, respectively. Compared with the SoC, the between-group weight change in the intervention was -11.9 kg (95% CI: -17.2, -6.6, p < 0.001) at 24 weeks. Liver biochemistry markers (alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, and total bilirubin) were stable in everyone throughout the trial. Iron-corrected T1 and steatosis significantly reduced (-149.9 ms [95% CI -258.1, -41.7, p = 0.01] and -6% [95% CI -11.3, -0.6, p = 0.03], respectively). There were no between-group differences in changes in liver stiffness (0.2 kPa [95% CI -1.1, 1.6]), the physical performance test (1.5 points [95% CI -1.9 to 4.9], p = 0.70) or the liver frailty index (0 [95% CI -0.6 to 0.6], p = 0.97). Compared with SoC, absolute fat-free mass reduced (-3.2 kg [95% CI -6 to -0.3], p = 0.04) but relative fat-free mass as percentage of total body weight increased (5.4% [95% CI 0.5 to 10.3], p = 0.046). No participant met the pre-defined safety criteria for enhanced observation or intervention discontinuation. There was no between-group differences in changes in cardiovascular markers and no evidence of hepatic decompensation or serious adverse events. Severe energy restriction appears a safe option to achieve significant weight loss and reduce liver fat without adverse effects in people with CC-MASLD. A larger study is needed to confirm these findings. ISRCTN13053035, prospectively registered, overall study status: closed.",

    "title": "Sustained metabolic reduction and hypothermia in humans.",
    "abstract": "Metabolic reduction is an adaptation employed by animals encountering environmental stressors or scarce resources. Lowering metabolism in humans may be useful to reduce consumables, oxygen utilization and carbon dioxide excretion. This is relevant for payload optimization or resource-restricted scenarios such as long-duration spaceflight or austere terrestrial environments (e.g., Arctic/Antarctic, submarine, cave or mine extraction). We previously demonstrated intravenous and single oral or sublingual doses of dexmedetomidine reduce oxygen consumption, wakefulness, and core body temperature in healthy humans. However, longer-acting dosing strategies are required to achieve greater levels of metabolic reduction. We explored whether a sublingual loading dose followed by subcutaneous infusion (SQI) of dexmedetomidine with and without surface cooling can decrease metabolic rate for 6 hours. We recruited 11 healthy volunteers, 4 male, median age 23 (IQR 21-25), who completed one-day laboratory studies measuring core body temperature via telemetry and metabolic rate via indirect calorimetry. Participants consumed an oral loading bolus of dexmedetomidine (2 μg/kg) followed by a six-hour SQI of dexmedetomidine (1 μg/kg/hr). Surface cooling pads were placed on the backs of 7 participants to promote heat loss. We collected vital signs continuously and monitored participants until they could be safely discharged. Energy expenditure (EE; kcals per day) dropped from baseline regardless of surface cooling. With surface cooling, median temperature decreased from 36.9°C (IQR 36.7-37.0°C) at baseline to 35.4°C (IQR 35.3-35.5°C) at 6 hours. Sublingual loading dose followed by 6-hour SQI of dexmedetomidine safely and effectively reduces metabolic rate. Future studies should be evaluating the effectiveness of SQI dexmedetomidine without a sublingual loading bolus, evaluating novel administration methods, and determining if tolerance develops with long-term use.",

    "abstract": "Time-restricted eating (TRE) has attracted increasing attention from researchers and the public. Recent studies suggest that the combination of TRE with energy restriction (ER) may have more favourable effects on both physical and biochemical aspects compared to ER alone. The aim of the present 3-month intervention study was to determine the effects of an 8-h early time-restricted eating and an 8-h late time-restricted eating with ER (eTRE + ER and lTRE + ER) compared to 12-h ER alone on body mass and other anthropometric and cardiometabolic risk factors in participants with overweight and obesity. Participants (n = 108) were allocated to three different groups according to their personal chronotype: eTRE + ER (37 participants), lTRE + ER (37 participants) and ER (34 participants). Ninety-three participants completed the entire 3-month intervention (34 in eTRE + ER, 28 in lTRE + ER and 31 in ER). Anthropometric and cardiometabolic risk factors were measured at baseline and after 1, 2 and 3 months of the intervention. Sleep quality and quality of life were assessed at baseline and after 3 months of the intervention. ER was determined based on the individual's resting metabolic rate. Effects were analyzed using the per-protocol approach. Results showed a significant time main effect (p < 0.001), suggesting a decrease in body mass at the end of the 3-month intervention with a mean loss of -5.0 kg (95 % CI, -5.7, -4.3) for the eTRE + ER group, -4.4 kg (95 % CI, -5.2, -3.6) for the lTRE + ER group and -4.3 kg (95 % CI, -5.0, -3.6) for the ER group, with no significant difference between the groups (p = 0.319). eTRE + ER had greater improvements in fat mass (-1.2 % (95 % CI, -2.1, -0.2), p = 0.013) and fasting glucose (-0.35 mmol/L (95 % CI, -0.63, -0.06), p = 0.012) than participants in the lTRE + ER group and greater improvements in fat mass (-1.1 % (95 % CI, -2.0, -0.1), p = 0.022), metabolic age (-3 years (95 % CI, -5, -0), p = 0.028) and diastolic blood pressure (-4 mmHg (95 % CI, -8, -0), p = 0.033) than the participants in the ER group. No significant changes were found between the groups for the other parameters measured. There was no difference in body mass between the eTRE + ER, lTRE + ER and ER groups after 3 months of intervention. However, eTRE + ER showed a greater benefit for fasting blood glucose, certain anthropometric parameters and diastolic blood pressure compared to lTRE + ER and/or ER alone. Other anthropometric, biochemical and health-related parameters were not affected by eating window. https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05730231.",

The results demonstrated that FeBC could significantly improve the denitrification performance, the nitrate removal rate was significantly increased by 30 % at C/N ratio of 3 (W/W) with little nitrite and nitrous oxide accumulation, attributing to the enhanced activities of the ETS and denitrifying reductases and complex microbial interactions via increased abundance of microorganisms involved in carbon and nitrogen transformations. Biochemical quantification and electrochemical analysis, revealed that FeBC activated the acceleration of the ETS process. Comparative metagenome analyses indicated that upregulating key enzymes in the tricarboxylic acid cycle was the potential respiratory enzyme associated with FeBC-mediated ETS. NADH/NAD",

In calorie-restricted, obese mice, chronic treatment with tirzepatide reduced the drop in energy expenditure that occurred in vehicle-treated and pair-fed mice, indicating that tirzepatide attenuated metabolic adaptation. Respiratory exchange ratio also decreased in tirzepatide-treated mice, indicating increased fat oxidation. In the clinical trial, tirzepatide appeared to have no impact on metabolic adaptation but led to increased fat oxidation and reductions in appetite and calorie intake during an ad libitum test meal (vs. placebo).

Currently, calorimetry is the most widely used method to measure those costs in laboratory studies, whereas field studies use the doubly labeled water method, heart rate and dynamic body acceleration (DBA). However, these methods are limited or even biased because of restricted space for movement, low temporal resolution and/or the need for logger attachment or implantation. Measuring energy costs of behaviors is difficult, especially in small, highly mobile animals. Here, using a damselfish, Chromis viridis, we demonstrate that DBA, obtained from marker-less, automatic video tracking and 3D reconstruction, can effectively estimate oxygen consumption rate. We show that our video-based DBA method can be used to estimate metabolic costs of various activities, such as locomotion and feeding, on an individual basis.",

This prospective outpatient study included 17 women with obesity (mean age 41.6 years; body mass index 37.5 kg/m2) who followed a 1-month VLCKD (700-800 kcal/day, carbohydrate 11%, fat 46%, protein 43%) at the University Hospital of Pisa. Measurements of 24-hour energy expenditure (24hEE) and substrate oxidation were conducted in a metabolic chamber at day 1 (V1), day 8 (V2), and day 29 (V3). Body composition was assessed by Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Twenty-two women with obesity fed a balanced isocaloric diet served as controls. Compared with controls, carbohydrate oxidation (CarbOx) was lower, whereas fat oxidation (FatOx) and protein oxidation (ProtOx) were higher in the VLCKD group at V1. CarbOx decreased by 65%, while FatOx increased by 11% at V3. The rate of ProtOx was already higher than in controls at V1 and remained stable throughout the study. After 1 month, body weight decreased by 7%, reflecting an 8.8% reduction in fat mass and a 5.6% reduction in lean soft tissue (LST). A 10% decrease in 24hEE and 24-hour sleeping metabolic rate was observed at V3 compared with V1. VLCKD promotes weight loss in women with obesity. Our findings highlight the shift in energy metabolism towards increased FatOx accompanied by a modest increase in protein oxidation, a decrease in LST and a reduction in EE.",

    "abstract": "Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) severely restricts the healthy development of global animal husbandry, and the unclear pathogenic mechanism of FMD virus (FMDV) leads to difficulty in preventing and purifying FMD. Glycolytic remodelling is considered one of the hallmarks of viral infection, providing energy and precursors for viral assembly and replication. In this work, the interaction and mechanism between FMDV and glycolysis were explored from the perspective of immune metabolism. We found that FMDV infection increased the extracellular acidification rate, lactic acid accumulation, and HK2 level. In addition, during FMDV infection, HK2 enhances glycolytic activity and mediates autophagic degradation of IRF3/7 to antagonize the innate immune response, thereby promoting viral replication. Our findings provide evidence that FMDV is closely correlated with host metabolism, increasing the understanding that glycolysis and HK2 facilitate virus infection, and provide new ideas for further elucidating the pathogenic mechanism of FMDV.",

    "abstract": "Worldwide, nearly 40% of adults are overweight and 13% are obese. Health consequences of excess weight include cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, and increased mortality. Treating obesity is challenging and calorie restriction often leads to rebound weight gain. Treatments such as bariatric surgery create hesitancy among patients due to their invasiveness. GLP-1 medications have revolutionized weight loss and can reduce body weight in obese patients by between 15% and 25% on average after about 1 year. Their mode of action is to mimic the endogenous GLP-1, an intestinal hormone that regulates glucose metabolism and satiety. However, GLP-1 drugs carry known risks and, since their use for weight loss is recent, may carry unforeseen risks as well. They carry a boxed warning for people with a personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma or multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2. Gastrointestinal adverse events (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) are fairly common while pancreatitis and intestinal obstruction are rarer. There may be a loss of lean body mass as well as premature facial aging. A significant disadvantage of using these medications is the high rate of weight regain when they are discontinued. Achieving success with pharmacologic treatment and then weaning to avoid future negative effects would be ideal.",

    "abstract": "The recurrence rate of spontaneous pneumothorax (collapsed lung) is 30 % after basic conservative treatments, and it can reach up to 20 % after surgery due to the limited effectiveness of current surgical techniques. This highlights the need for the development of new, effective treatment approaches supported by biomaterials. Therefore, we aimed to develop a biomaterial that does not restrict the aerodynamic movements of the lungs, is resistant to lung pressure, and can withstand the movements during inhalation and exhalation,to prevent and treat pneumothorax recurrence. For this purpose, biodegradable matrices were prepared using polycaprolactone (PCL), gelatin (GEL), and amoxicillin (AMX), which is a broad-spectrum antibiotic. The matrices were designed with a nanofiber/net (NFN) structure, targeting appropriate degradation rates and mechanical strength. NFN matrices with randomly arranged and bead-free fibers were produced by electrospinning PCL/GEL and PCL/GEL-AMX solutions in different ratios. The incorporation of AMX reduced the fiber diameter, while the addition of GEL increased the fiber diameters, resulting in fibrous matrices with diameters ranging from 194 nm to 1,100 nm. Additionally, adding GEL and/or AMX to the structure caused the fiber surfaces to resemble tree bark, and spider web-like nano networks formed between the fibers. These formations were particularly homogeneous and dense in the (7:3) PCL/GEL-5AMX group. Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis showed that the elemental composition of the fibers and the nano-networks was similar. The elastic moduli of the matrix groups ranged from 3.97 ± 0.74 MPa to 19.02 ± 1.91 MPa, which was found to be suitable for the target range for lung tissue. Hydrolytic degradation studies indicated that nano-networks remained present in the structure after 5 weeks, and 55-68 % of the loaded AMX was released within 14 days. In the AMX-loaded groups, both Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Streptococcus aureus (S. aureus) growth were inhibited, with the most effective inhibition observed in the (7:3) PCL/GEL-5AMX group. In conclusion, it was assessed that the spider web-like nano-networks, which increased with the GEL and AMX ratio in the solution, mimicked the structure of lung alveoli at the nanoscale due to their large surface area and small pore size between the fibers. Particularly, the (7:3) PCL/GEL-5AMX NFN matrix could be used as a new and effective alternative material in pneumothorax therapy.",

Time-restricted eating (TRE) may aid in facilitating weight loss to prevent diabetes. Here, we investigated if TRE in individuals with overweight and prediabetes or obesity affects mitochondrial bioenergetics of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and platelets using the Seahorse extracellular flux technology. In a 3-month randomized controlled trial, PBMCs/platelets were analyzed from 52 participants before and after a TRE intervention with a 10-h eating window or habitual living. PBMC and platelet respiratory function was evaluated through sequential addition of substrates, uncouplers, and inhibitors in living cells. After 3 months, there were no statistically significant differences in mitochondrial respiration within or between the TRE and control groups. Association analyses between PBMC/platelet respiration and clinical parameters including body mass index and fat mass showed no significant effects. In conclusion, 3 months of 10-h TRE does not alter the mitochondrial bioenergetics of PBMCs and platelets in individuals with high risk of type 2 diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Inflorescence architecture is established during the early stages of reproductive development and depends on the activity and identity of meristems. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the floral meristems (FMs), which will develop into flowers, arise with precise spatiotemporal regulation from the inflorescence meristem (IM). The outcome of this process is a geometrically organized structure characterized by a reiterated pattern called phyllotaxis, in which successive organs arise at specific divergence angles of 137.5°. Here we show that REM34 and REM35 transcription factors control phyllotactic patterning through cooperative interaction with ARF7 and ARF19, influencing the cell cycle rate and thus the IM dimension. Our proposed model suggests that ARF7 and ARF19, whose activity is triggered by auxin accumulation, interact with REM34 and REM35 to regulate two auxin-induced genes, LBD18 and PUCHI, whose mutants phenocopy the permutated phyllotactic pattern of rem34 rem35 and arf7 arf19. This complex also restricts cell cycling activity to specific areas of the meristem, indirectly determining its dimension and ultimately establishing FM positioning and phyllotaxis. Reiterative patterns are found in morphogenetic processes of complex organisms, and phyllotaxis has been employed to understand the mechanisms behind this regularity. Our research broadens the knowledge on this mechanism which is also strictly correlated with yield.",

    "title": "Low-Carbohydrate Diet Exacerbates Denervation-Induced Atrophy of Rat Skeletal Muscle Under the Condition of Identical Protein Intake.",
    "abstract": "While decreased protein intake is associated with muscle mass loss, it is unclear whether a decrease in carbohydrate intake adversely affects muscle atrophy independently of protein intake. Herein, we examined whether a low-carbohydrate (low-CHO) diet exacerbates denervation-induced muscle atrophy under conditions of identical protein intake. On day one of the experiment, male Wistar rats underwent unilateral denervation. The contralateral leg was used as the control. After denervation, rats were divided into two dietary groups: high-carbohydrate (high-CHO) and low-CHO. Each group was fed a high-CHO (70% carbohydrate) or low-CHO (20% carbohydrate) diet over 7 days. Total protein and energy intakes in both groups were matched by pair feeding. Rats were provided with deuterium oxide (D Denervation reduced wet weight of the gastrocnemius muscle compared to the contralateral control (p < 0.05). Reductions in gastrocnemius muscle weight were greater in the low-CHO group (-34%) than the high-CHO group (-28%) (p < 0.05). Although denervation decreased MPS compared to the contralateral control (p < 0.05), no dietary effect on MPS was observed. Denervation resulted in increased mRNA and protein expression of Atrogin-1, a ubiquitin E3 ligase, compared to that in the contralateral control (p < 0.05). Increases in Atrogin-1 gene and protein expression due to denervation were greater in the low-CHO group than in the high-CHO group (p < 0.05). We conclude that a low-CHO diet may exacerbate denervation-induced atrophy in fast-twitch-dominant muscles compared to a high-CHO diet, even when the same protein intake is maintained. Although blunted MPS contributed to muscle atrophy due to denervation, exacerbation of muscle atrophy by the low-CHO diet was not accompanied by explanatory changes in MPS. The effect of the low-CHO diet might be related to promotion of muscle-specific ubiquitin E3 ligase gene expression.",

    "abstract": "While a significant number of normal-weight individuals are engaged in dieting practices, there is a need to better characterize the composition of weight change during and after weight loss (WL) intervention in this population. The study aimed to examine body composition in response to diet-induced WL and 4-month follow-up in normal-weight adults. Thirty-five participants (23 ± 4 y, 24 females) joined the laboratory to measure body weight (BW) and body composition using Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry on 5 occasions: baseline (T0), 3 % WL (T1, n = 32), 6 % WL (T2, n = 18), 1-month follow-up (T3, n = 18), 4-month follow-up (T4, n = 16). BW, fat mass ([FM], kg and %), and lean body mass (LBM) decreased at T1 and T2 compared to T0 (p < 0.01). While the participants with lower initial adiposity lost a lower proportion of FM at T1 and T2 (rho < -0.45, p < 0.05), the rate of WL and WL duration were not associated with changes in body composition. Participants declaring to stop the diet after the intervention significantly regained more BW and LBM, but not FM, from the end of the intervention to T3 (p < 0.01) and T4 (p ≤ 0.01) compared to those who wanted to continue. To conclude, while both FM and LBM tissues were reduced in response to a diet-induced WL, only a major LBM regain was observed after 4 months of follow-up in participants who declared to not continue the diet at the end of the intervention.",

    "abstract": "Caloric restriction and excessive exercise create an energy imbalance with medical sequelae in restrictive eating disorders. We examined the effect of acute and chronic energy imbalance on admission illness severity and refeeding outcomes in adolescents and young adults with anorexia nervosa (AN) and atypical AN. Secondary data analysis from the Study of Refeeding to Optimize Inpatient Gains, a multicenter randomized trial comparing higher- versus lower-calorie refeeding in 120 youth with AN or atypical AN hospitalized with medical instability. Vital signs were measured daily. Acute energy balance was calculated as caloric output (exercise recall plus estimated resting energy expenditure) subtracted from caloric input (dietary recall) before admission. Chronic energy imbalance variables included magnitude, rate, and duration of weight loss before admission. Regression analyses examined associations among energy balance, illness severity, and refeeding outcomes; dominance analyses examined the relative importance of energy balance. Among 82 participants (91% female), admission mean (SD) age was 16.5 (2.5) years, %median body mass index was 85 (10) and acute energy balance was -898 (678) kilocalories. Those with more negative acute energy balance before admission required more days (-0.18, [95% CI, -0.35, -0.02] p = .03) and kilocalories to restore medical stability (-431.10, [95% CI, -857.06, -5.13] p = .047). Acute energy balance was a more important predictor than weight suppression in determining these outcomes. More acute negative energy balance was associated with a need for more intensive refeeding, which supports the inclusion of preadmission dietary recall and exercise assessments, alongside weight history, to inform individualized refeeding protocols.",

BMR and body composition indices were measured through bioelectrical impedance analysis. The associations and predictions related to CI were explored using multivariable-adjusted logistic regression, restricted cubic spline (RCS) models, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses. Mediation analysis explored the role of BMR adjusted by body surface area (BMR/BSA) in CI risk. Patients with CI showed significantly lower BMR, BMR adjusted for height squared (BMR/Height²), BMR/BSA, appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM), and fat-free mass (FFM), alongside higher waist circumference (WC) and percentage of body fat. Logistic regression showed that participants in the fourth quartile of BMR, BMR/Height Low energy expenditure assessed by BMR/BSA is an independent risk factor for increased CI risk in middle-aged and elderly T2DM patients.

    "abstract": "Physiological adaptations to fasting enable humans to survive for prolonged periods without food and involve molecular pathways that may drive life-prolonging effects of dietary restriction in model organisms. Mobilization of fatty acids and glycerol from adipocyte lipid stores by canonical neutral lipases, including the rate limiting adipose triglyceride lipase (Pnpla2/ATGL), is critical to the adaptive fasting response. Here we discovered an alternative mechanism of lipolysis in adipocytes involving a lysosomal program. We functionally tested lysosomal lipolysis with pharmacological and genetic approaches in mice and in murine and human adipocyte and adipose tissue explant culture, establishing dependency on lysosomal acid lipase (LIPA/LAL) and the microphthalmia/transcription factor E (MiT/TFE) family. Our study establishes a model whereby the canonical pathway is critical for rapid lipolytic responses to adrenergic stimuli operative in the acute stage of fasting, while the alternative lysosomal pathway dominates with prolonged fasting.",

The purpose of this study was to investigate adaptions of body composition, blood status, resting metabolic rate, and endurance performance to gain more comprehensive insights into the symptoms of LEA and the adaptive effects in the athlete population (active women (n = 11) and men (n = 11)). Three treatments were defined as 45 (EA45, control), 30 (EA30), and 10 (EA10) kcal/kg FFM/day and randomly assigned. Pre- and post-intervention measurements were performed through blood sampling, bioelectrical impedance analysis, resting metabolic rate measurement, the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), and the incremental endurance test to exhaustion. There was a significant reduction in body weight and fat mass in EA10 compared to EA45 ( In conclusion, this short-term study indicates that energy restriction can lead to several metabolic-related adaptations, which suggests that the availability and regulation of glucose and fats are significantly influenced after only five days of LEA in physically active women and men. Future research should focus on longer exposures of LEA and sex-specific comparisons (including the menstrual cycle) on LEA symptoms.",

    "abstract": "In China, the crude oil supply is highly dependent on overseas countries, and thus strengthening crude oil self-sufficiency has become an important issue of the national energy security. Tertiary oil recovery, especially polymer flooding, has been widely applied in large oil fields in China, which can increase the recovery rate by 15%-20% compared with water flooding. However, the widely used oil flooding polymers show poor thermal stability and salinity tolerance, complicated synthesis ways of monomers, and environmental unfriendliness. Moreover, the polymer flooding induces problems including pore plugging, heterogeneity intensification, high dispersion of remaining oil resources, pressure rise in injection wells, and low efficiency circulation of injection medium, which restrict the subsequent recovery of old oil fields. Here, we systematically review the developing and current situations of polymer flooding, introduce the innovative biomanufacturing of oil flooding polymers and their monomers or precursors as well as low-cost bio-based chemical raw materials for multiple compound flooding. The comprehensive study of the relationships between microbial fermentation metabolites and polymer flooding will reveal the green and low-carbon paths for polymer flooding. Such study will enable the application of enzymes produced by microorganisms in polymer production and polymer plugging removal after polymer flooding as well as the application of microbial metabolites such as biosurfactants, organic acids, alcohols, biogas, and amino acids in enhancing oil recovery. This review suggests that incorporating biomanufacturing into polymer flooding will ensure the high productivity and stability for crude oil production in China.",

    "abstract": "While there are numerous benefits to tea consumption, its long-term impact on patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) remains unclear. Our analysis included 17,575 individuals with CKD from an initial 45,019 participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) (1999-2018). Individuals with extreme dietary habits, pregnancy, or non-CKD conditions were excluded. Key cohort demographics revealed a mean age of 62.3 years, with 52.1% female participants, and 57.3% identified as non-Hispanic White. A total of 5,835 deaths were recorded during follow-up, including 1,823 cardiovascular-related deaths. Cox and restricted cubic spline regression was used to examine the linear or nonlinear association of tea consumption with mortality. The substitution analysis explored the effects of replacing a specific type of tea with another type of tea.

    "title": "Degradation of naphthalene in aqueous solution using a microbial symbiotic system founded by degrading and ureolytic bacteria.",
    "abstract": "Although single bacteria have been applied to the Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) remediation, its efficacy is severely restricted by long degradation periods and low efficacy. A microbial symbiotic system founded by two or more bacterial strains may be an alternative to traditional remediation approaches. Its construction is, however, hampered by antagonistic interactions and remains challenging. The present work proposed a microbial symbiotic system consisting of the naphthalene degrading bacteria and the non-PAHs degrading bacteria and improved their interspecies interactions by using sequential inoculation. The non-PAHs degrading bacteria were inoculated after the inoculation of the naphthalene degrading bacteria. The sequential inoculation not only promoted the non-PAHs degrading bacteria to use the metabolites of the naphthalene degrading bacteria as an energy source but developed a resistance of the two bacterial strains to naphthalene. Vaterite and aragonite were identified following urea hydrolysis by the non-PAHs degrading bacteria. The faster precipitation rate in naphthalene degradation by the symbiotic system elevated the proportion of vaterite, allowing more naphthalene and its metabolites to be wrapped in or attached to minerals with the bacteria through the physisorption (van der Waals force) and chemisorption (Ca-π interaction with aromatic rings) and promoting the formation of aggregates. The formation of aggregates further reduced the mobility of naphthalene. Results indicate that 40% of naphthalene in the non-inoculated sterile control group was quickly released into the atmosphere, causing serious public concerns regarding health safety. According to the thermogravimetry-gas chromatography mass spectrometry (TG-GC/MS) analysis, no trace of naphthalene was found in the samples, indicating that the degrading bacteria fully degraded naphthalene after its adsorption. As a result, the degradation efficiency of 100% was attained using the symbiotic system even at 200 mg/L naphthalene. The findings underscore the relative merits of the symbiotic system applied to the remediation of naphthalene in an aqueous solution.",

    "abstract": "The global rise in obesity underscores the need for effective weight management strategies that address individual metabolic and hormonal variability, moving beyond the simplistic \"calories in, calories out\" model. Body types-ectomorph, mesomorph, and endomorph-provide a framework for understanding the differences in fat storage, muscle development, and energy expenditure, as each type responds uniquely to caloric intake and exercise. Variability in weight outcomes is influenced by factors such as genetic polymorphisms and epigenetic changes in hormonal signaling pathways and metabolic processes, as well as lifestyle factors, including nutrition, exercise, sleep, and stress. These factors impact the magnitude of lipogenesis and myofibrillar protein synthesis during overfeeding, as well as the extent of lipolysis and muscle proteolysis during caloric restriction, through complex mechanisms that involve changes in the resting metabolic rate, metabolic pathways, and hormonal profiles. Precision approaches, such as nutrigenomics, indirect calorimetry, and artificial-intelligence-based strategies, can potentially leverage these insights to create individualized weight management strategies aligned with each person's unique metabolic profile. By addressing these personalized factors, precision nutrition offers a promising pathway to sustainable and effective weight management outcomes. The main objective of this review is to examine the metabolic and hormonal adaptations driving variability in weight management outcomes and explore how precision nutrition can address these challenges through individualized strategies.",

    "abstract": "Currently, a variety of anticancer agents are used in the treatment of cancer. Since anticancer agents are used continuously over a long time, they carry the risk of side effects. One of the major side effects is cardiac dysfunction. For example, doxorubicin, an anthracycline-type anticancer agent, is clinically restricted because of its dose-dependent cardiotoxicity. Cardiotoxicity includes decreased ejection fraction, arrhythmias, and congestive heart failure, all of which are associated with high mortality rates. Therefore, it is important to assess the risk of cardiotoxicity of anticancer agents in advance. Cardiomyocytes require energy to beat and retain an abundance of mitochondria. We established quantitative measurements of mitochondrial length and respiratory activities using cardiomyocytes. We found that exposure of human iPS cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) to anticancer agents with reported cardiotoxicity enhanced mitochondrial hyperfission and the oxygen consumption rate was significantly reduced. Knockdown of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), mitochondrial fission-accelerating GTP-binding protein, suppressed mitochondrial hyperfission in hiPSC-CMs. This indicates that visualizing mitochondrial functions in hiPSC-CMs will be helpful in assessing the risk of cardiotoxicity caused by anticancer agents and that maintaining mitochondrial quality will become a new strategy to reduce anticancer agents-induced cardiotoxicity. In this review, we present the evaluation of cardiotoxicity targeting mitochondrial quality in anticancer agents, using osimertinib, a non-small cell lung cancer drug, as an example.",

This prospective study compares the effects of caloric restriction and isocaloric diets with different macronutrient distributions on body composition and anthropometric parameters in obese women during a 12-week weight loss program, aiming to identify the most effective dietary strategies for managing obesity-related health outcomes. A certified clinical nutritionist assigned specific diets over a 12-week period to 150 participants, distributed as follows: hypocaloric diets-low-energy diet (LED, 31 subjects) and very low-energy diet (VLED, 13 subjects); isocaloric diets with macronutrient distribution-low-carbohydrate diet (LCD, 48 subjects), ketogenic diet (KD, 23 subjects), and high-protein diet (HPD, 24 subjects); and isocaloric diet without macronutrient distribution-time-restricted eating (TRE, 11 subjects). Participants were dynamically monitored using anthropometric parameters: body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), waist to hip ratio (WHR) and bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) using the TANITA Body Composition Analyzer BC-418 MA III (T5896, Tokyo, Japan) at three key intervals-baseline, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks. The following parameters were evaluated: body weight, basal metabolic rate (BMR), percentage of total body fat, trunk fat, muscle mass, fat-free mass, and hydration status. All diets led to weight loss, but differences emerged over time. The TRE model resulted in significantly less weight loss compared to LED at the final follow-up (6.30 kg,  This study highlights the superior long-term benefits of isocaloric diets with macronutrients distribution over calorie-restrictive diets in optimizing weight, BMI, body composition, and central adiposity.",

Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to an intensive weight loss lifestyle intervention (intervention group [IG]) consisting of an energy-restricted Mediterranean diet (MedDiet), physical activity promotion and behavioral support, or a control group (CG) receiving ad libitum MedDiet recommendations. The primary outcome was between-group differences in cystatin C-based kidney function (cystatin C-based estimated glomerular filtration rate-eGFRcys-and combined cystatin C-creatinine-based eGFR-eGFRcr-cys) change from baseline to 12 and 36 months. Secondary outcomes included between-group differences in creatinine-based eGFR (eGFRcr) and urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) change and the predictive capacity of these formulas at baseline for new-onset chronic kidney disease (CKD). A total of 1909 participants (65 ± 5 years, 54% men) were included. Twelve-month decline in eGFRcys, eGFRcr-cys, and eGFRcr was greater in the CG compared to the IG, with between-group differences of -1.77 mL/min/1.73 m In older adults with overweight/obesity and metabolic syndrome, the PREDIMED-Plus intervention may be an optimal approach to preserve kidney function.",

    "title": "Maternal Low-Protein Diet Leads to Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Impaired Energy Metabolism in the Skeletal Muscle of Male Rats.",
    "abstract": "A prenatal low-protein (LP) diet disrupts glucose homeostasis in adult offspring. Skeletal muscles are one of the main sites of glucose clearance, and mitochondria residing in the muscle fibers are central to glucose homeostasis. Our previous studies indicated that impaired mitochondrial health is central to dysregulated glucose metabolism in the gastrocnemius muscle of the LP-programmed female rats. In addition, dysfunctional mitochondria are often an indicator of underlying irregularities in energy metabolism and metabolic inflexibility. Therefore, this study examined the mitochondrial function and metabolic flexibility in the skeletal muscles of prenatal LP-programmed adult male rats. Pregnant Wistar rats were randomly allotted to a control diet (20% protein) or an isocaloric LP diet (6% protein). Standard laboratory rat chow was given to the dams and the pups after delivery and weaning. Gene and protein expressions, mtDNA copy number, and electron microscopy were assessed in gastrocnemius (GS) muscle, and the mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate was determined using isolated flexor digitorum brevis muscle fibers. The genes associated with mitochondrial outer membrane fusion, mitofusin1 and 2 (Mfn1 and Mfn2), fission (Fis1), and biogenesis (Pgc1B, Nrf1, and Esrra) were lower in the LP group. Further, our functional studies showed that the ATP-linked oxygen consumption rate (OCR), maximal, spare respiratory, and non-mitochondrial respiration-associated OCRs were lower in the LP rats. Further, the mRNA and protein expressions of Ndufb8, a key factor involved in the complex-I catalytic activity, were downregulated in the LP group. In addition, the expression of genes linked to mitochondrial pyruvate transport (Mpc1) and metabolism (Pdha1) was lower in the LP group. In contrast, the expression of mitochondrial fatty acid transporters (Cpt1a and Cpt2) was higher in the LP when compared to the control group. However, electron microscopic analysis exhibited no difference in the mitochondrial ultrastructure in the LP muscle compared to the control. Altogether, our results indicate that the LP diet affects the mitochondrial complex-I integrity and dynamics and leads to altered expression of genes associated with substrate oxidation and mitochondrial dysfunction in the skeletal muscle of the male LP offspring.",

    "abstract": "High-fat diet (HFD) intake is a potent inducer of oxidative stress, promoting metabolic dysfunction and accelerated ageing. Identifying interventions capable of mitigating this persistent redox burden is therefore essential. This study investigated the combined efficacy of α-lipoic acid (LA) supplementation and a daily climbing regimen in counteracting HFD-induced oxidative stress across different life stages and mating statuses in Drosophila melanogaster. Flies were maintained on an HFD and subjected to LA (2 mM or 2.5 mM), climbing exercise, or their combination during early, mid, or late life. Oxidative stress resistance was evaluated using hydrogen peroxide challenge assays, and peroxide accumulation was quantified via the FOX method. Combined LA and climbing treatment significantly enhanced stress resistance and reduced peroxide levels in early- and mid-life flies, outperforming either intervention alone. This benefit was most pronounced in unmated flies, indicating that physiological costs associated with mating diminish adaptive responsiveness. Notably, while LA alone reduced fecundity, its combination with climbing restored reproductive output, suggesting exercise-mediated alleviation of resource-allocation trade-offs. In late-life groups, the interventions produced only modest biochemical improvements without corresponding lifespan extension, highlighting age-related loss of physiological plasticity and the limited reversibility of cumulative oxidative damage. Overall, the findings demonstrated that integrating antioxidant supplementation with hormetic exercise elicited superior protection against HFD-induced oxidative stress, but the magnitude of benefit depended strongly on age and reproductive status. These results underscore the importance of early, multifaceted interventions to maintain redox balance and physiological resilience.",

    "abstract": "The extent to which these exercise strategies alter metabolomic signatures of macronutrient metabolism in T1D is unknown. The current study evaluated glycemic variability and metabolomic responses around energy matched HIIT and MICT in individuals with T1D. Fourteen adults with T1D (7 females, 7 males) completed three conditions in a randomized crossover design: HIIT (10 one-minute intervals at 90% VO2peak), MICT (15-20 mins steady-state cycling at 65% VO2peak), and no exercise (control, CON). 24-hr glycemic responses via continuous glucose monitor (CGM) and metabolomics assessed by blood samples before, after, and 1-hour after exercise by targeted mass spectrometry and non-targeted gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Average whole-day glucose levels were higher on the day of HIIT (167.48±66.96mg/dL; group×time p=0.021) and MICT (166.46±61.35mg/dL; group×time p=0.039) compared to CON (150.43±61.69mg/dL) with no difference between HIIT and MICT (group×time p=0.999). Area under the curve for glucose was not different between HIIT, MICT, and CON on the day of exercise (group×time p=0.961). After MICT, long-chain acylcarnitine C14:2 (0.06±0.04µmol/L) was higher than after HIIT (0.04±0.02µmol/L; group×time p=0.008), with C16:1 (group×time p=0.046) and C16:2 (group×time p=0.021) higher than CON. In adults with T1D, HIIT and MICT elevated average glucose on the day of exercise, with greater fatty acid oxidation after MICT. These data support the metabolic safety and distinct fuel utilization of both exercise modalities in T1D.",

    "title": "Multi-Omics Revealed the Effects of Intrauterine Hyperglycemia Exposure on the Development of Skeletal Muscle in Offspring.",
    "abstract": "Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), a common pregnancy complication characterized by maternal hyperglycemia, negatively impacts offspring health. Skeletal muscle, a critical tissue for glucose and lipid metabolism, is especially vulnerable to prenatal environmental insults. However, the effects of intrauterine hyperglycemia (IUHG) on offspring skeletal muscle development remain poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate the effects of IUHG on skeletal muscle development in offspring and evaluate whether postnatal exercise could mitigate these effects. Pregnant mice were assigned to GDM and control groups. Offspring were further divided into control and exercise subgroups. Body weight, glucose tolerance test (GTT), insulin tolerance test (ITT), body composition, muscle strength and exercise capacity were assessed. At 20 weeks of age, skeletal muscle morphology was evaluated via various staining and Transmission Electron Microscope. Transcriptomic changes were analysed by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and chromatin accessibility was assessed using ATAC-seq to identify molecular mechanisms underlying IUHG-induced alterations. Additionally, primary fetal myoblasts were cultured under normal and high-glucose conditions to investigate metabolic changes and lipid accumulation in vitro. Offspring exposed to IUHG exhibited increased body weight, impaired glucose and insulin tolerance, altered body composition, reduced muscle strength and diminished exercise capacity at adulthood. Exercise intervention in diabetic offspring improved the muscle ratio (p < 0.05), fat ratio (p < 0.05), lipid profiles (p < 0.005) and muscle structure and strength (p < 0.005). Transcriptomic and epigenomic profiling identified significant changes in genes and regulatory elements associated with immune regulation, myogenesis, lipid metabolism and inflammation in GDM-exposed offspring. In vitro, high-glucose exposure of E14.5d fetal myoblasts led to significant metabolic reprogramming, including lipid accumulation and disruptions in glycolysis and oxidative metabolism. Furthermore, the expression of AP-1 family members Fos and Junb was up-regulated in myoblasts under high-glucose conditions, which aligns with the findings in the in vivo models. IUHG disrupts skeletal muscle development and metabolic function in offspring through structural, transcriptional and epigenetic alterations. Postnatal exercise partially reversed these impairments, highlighting its potential as a non-pharmacological intervention. These findings provide new insights into the developmental origins of skeletal muscle dysfunction in GDM-exposed offspring and underscore the importance of early prevention strategies.",

    "abstract": "To synthesize current evidence on sexual dimorphism in maximal fat oxidation (MFO) and its corresponding exercise intensity (FATmax), exploring key moderators influencing these parameters across populations. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis, registered in PROSPERO (CRD42024563620), following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 2020 guidelines. PubMed, Scopus, and EBSCOhost databases were searched from January 2001 to April 2024 for English- and Spanish-language studies examining MFO and FATmax during graded exercise tests. Studies were included if they reported sex-specific MFO and/or FATmax values derived from indirect calorimetry. Both cross-sectional and longitudinal designs were considered. Exclusion criteria included pooled-sex data, inaccessible full texts, and nonexercise-based MFO assessments. Thirty-six studies (n = 8,990; 5,133 females, 3,857 males) were included. Absolute MFO was significantly lower in females (MD: -0.06 g/min), but no significant differences were observed in relative MFO (standardized mean difference: 0.202, p = .096) or FATmax (mean difference: 1.29% VO2max, p = .254). Cardiorespiratory fitness, body mass index, and exercise modality were key moderators in both sexes. Treadmill exercise was associated with higher MFO, irrespective of sex. Notably, body mass index and age influenced sexual dimorphism in fat oxidation, with age showing a curvilinear (quadratic) relationship with FATmax, suggesting complex age-related adaptations (p = .008). This review questions the assumption that women consistently oxidize more fat than men during exercise. The influence of sex on fat metabolism appears context-dependent, emphasizing the need for individualized interpretation. Longitudinal studies are required to evaluate whether these differences confer cardiometabolic protection.",

    "abstract": "Fully hydrogenated vegetable oil-based non-dairy creamer (FHVO-NDC) is produced through complete hydrogenation of vegetable oil, resulting in a trans fat-free product commonly incorporated into sports foods and performance-oriented beverages. Because diet plays a crucial role in shaping athletic performance, understanding the potential physiological effects of FHVO-NDC is essential for athletes and fitness enthusiasts. However, the combined impact of FHVO-NDC on muscle physiology, serum metabolomic alterations, and gut microbiota has not been evaluated. Therefore, the objective of this study was to address this knowledge gap using a controlled mouse model. Experimental animals were assigned to two groups: a control group receiving regular water and a treatment group receiving water supplemented with FHVO-NDC. Multiple physiological and biochemical parameters were monitored, including body condition ( FHVO-NDC intake did not alter body condition or feeding behavior. However, it resulted in a measurable decline in athletic performance. This reduction was accompanied by decreased myofiber diameter ( Collectively, these findings suggest that FHVO-NDC consumption may exert detrimental effects on muscle physiology and athletic performance in the mouse model. The observed alterations in muscle traits, serum metabolites, and gut microbiota highlight potential biological mechanisms through which FHVO-NDC could negatively influence exercise capacity, warranting further investigation regarding its implications for athletes and physically active individuals.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is the most prevalent liver disease worldwide, particularly among individuals with overweight and obesity. Non-pharmacological strategies such as time-restricted feeding (TRF) and exercise training can effectively mitigate obesity and metabolic disorders associated with MASLD. However, the specific effects of TRF combined with aerobic training (AT), resistance training (RT), or combined training (CT) on weight loss and MASLD remain unclear. This study investigated the effects of 12 h-TRF and exercise training (AT, RT, and CT), applied alone or in combination with TRF, for 10 weeks in diet-induced obese male Swiss mice. Individually, TRF and all exercise protocols reduced weight gain and adiposity, improved glycemic homeostasis, and decreased hepatic fat accumulation. Combining TRF with exercise resulted in more pronounced improvements, suggesting complementary mechanisms. Among the interventions, TRF + AT was the most effective in reducing body weight, fat mass, and hepatic saturated fatty acid accumulation. TRF + CT induced similar effects but with a less marked reduction in hepatic steatosis. Moreover, TRF + AT downregulated lipogenic and inflammatory genes while upregulating genes related to hepatic fatty acid oxidation. TRF + RT was particularly effective in improving glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity. In conclusion, combining TRF with AT, RT, or CT significantly improved metabolic and hepatic parameters compared to TRF or training alone in obese mice. These findings highlight the synergistic potential of TRF and exercise and emphasize their specific outcomes, providing new perspectives for personalized interventions against obesity and MASLD.

    "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the systemic metabolic and functional consequences of short-term hindlimb immobilization and to determine the role of rehabilitative exercise in facilitating recovery of muscle mass, function and whole-body energy metabolism. Male ICR mice (n = 20) underwent 2 weeks of unilateral hindlimb immobilization, followed by 2 weeks of recovery with (n = 10) or without (n = 10) treadmill-based rehabilitative exercise. Whole-body energy metabolism (oxygen uptake, carbon dioxide production, respiratory exchange ratio, carbohydrate oxidation, fat oxidation, energy expenditure) was measured with body composition, grip strength, and gait analysis at three points: pre-immobilization, post-immobilization, and recovery. Immobilization induced significant reductions in body weight, lean mass, grip strength, and stride length, confirming rapid onset of immobilization-induced muscle atrophy. Paradoxically, despite the reduction in muscle mass and function, immobilization increased oxygen uptake, carbon dioxide production, fat oxidation, and energy expenditure, while reducing the respiratory exchange ratio. During recovery, exercise promoted lean mass restoration, increased grip strength and improved gait performance compared with passive recovery. Exercise also maintained carbohydrate utilization and energy expenditure, counteracting the decline observed in the passive recovery group. Short-term immobilization induces both structural and functional impairments and maladaptive systemic metabolic alteration such as enhanced fat oxidation and increased energy cost due to potential inefficiency. In contrast, rehabilitative exercise effectively restores muscle mass and function and supports metabolic flexibility. These findings underscore the importance of early low-intensity exercise as a strategy to preserve muscular and metabolic health during recovery from muscle immobilization.",

    "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) is associated with cardiac dysfunction caused by oxidative stress, inflammation, and fibrosis. Exercise has shown cardioprotective effects in T2D. However, the impact on the Advanced Glycation End Products (AGE) and its receptors remains unclear. In this study, we investigated whether aerobic exercise modulates the AGE signaling pathway in the hearts of diabetic mice and whether it is associated with oxidative and inflammatory damage. Male C57BL/6 mice were fed a control (CTL) diet or a high-fat, high-carbohydrate (HFHC) diet to induce T2D. A subset of the T2D mice underwent aerobic training for 12 weeks (T2D EX), whereas the other mice remained sedentary (T2D). Cardiac tissues were analyzed for AGE deposition, AGE receptors expression, oxidative stress markers, cytokine profiles, and histological changes, including fibrosis and inflammation. Aerobic exercise in T2D mice reduced the cardiac deposition of fluorescent AGEs and CML, decreased RAGE protein and gene expression, downregulated CD36 and galectin-3 receptors, while not affecting GLO-1 detoxification system. Exercise in T2D mice suppressed cardiac inflammation and fibrosis. Improvements in inflammatory profiles included reduced expression of IL-6, TNF-α, and NF-kB. However, markers of oxidative stress, such as malondialdehyde, remained largely unaffected by exercise. Pearson's correlation analysis showed strong associations between AGE signaling pathway components and cardiac fibrosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress parameters. Aerobic exercise mitigates cardiac changes in T2D by downregulating the AGE signaling pathway and reducing fibrosis and inflammation. These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of exercise in interfering with AGE-mediated mechanisms to alleviate T2D-associated cardiovascular complications.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the effects of 4-week and 8-week moderate-intensity aerobic exercise on body composition and markers of inflammation and oxidative stress in middle-aged obese Hispanic females, with a particular focus on assessing these changes independently of fat mass reduction. A total of 35 participants were randomly assigned to either an exercise group or a control group for an eight-week intervention. The exercise group performed treadmill-based aerobic training at 55% of maximal oxygen consumption, with a fixed workload adjusted for body mass and a progression from three to four weekly sessions. Body composition was assessed using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, and blood samples were collected at baseline, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks to analyze tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), C-reactive protein, adiponectin, total antioxidant status (TAS), and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG). After 8 weeks, the exercise group showed significant reductions in body fat percentage, TNF-α, and 8-OHdG, alongside an increase in TAS. Notably, by week 4, significant decreases in TNF-α and increases in TAS were observed despite no measurable changes in body weight or fat mass, indicating an early anti-inflammatory and antioxidative response to exercise independent of adiposity reduction. The findings at 4 weeks suggest that moderate aerobic exercise can independently reduce inflammation and oxidative stress, even before measurable fat loss occurs. These improvements were further enhanced by fat loss after 8 weeks, indicating that moderate aerobic exercise may reduce the risk of obesity-related disorders in middle-aged obese females, both through direct anti-inflammatory effects and by promoting fat loss.",

    "abstract": "Bariatric surgery (BS) is an effective intervention for morbid obesity; however, it is often accompanied by undesirable muscle mass loss, which can negatively affect metabolic function and physical performance. Probiotics and resistance training have been studied discretely to address this complication. The present randomized controlled trial investigated the independent and combined effects of probiotic-enriched yogurt and resistance training on muscle preservation and related health outcomes in post-BS patients. In this parallel, randomized controlled trial, 52 participants who had recently undergone BS and met the eligibility criteria were randomly assigned to one of four groups: group A (probiotic-enriched yogurt plus resistance training [FY+RT]), group B (probiotic-enriched yogurt [FY]), group C (resistance training [RT]), and group D (control), with 13 participants in each group. Anthropometric indices, body composition, functional performance, inflammatory and oxidative stress markers, lipid profile, and liver enzymes were measured at baseline and after a 12-week intervention. All participants completed the intervention. The FY+RT group showed the greatest preservation of muscle mass, with the smallest reductions in fat-free mass percentage (-2.32%,  The combination of probiotic-enriched yogurt and resistance training was the most effective strategy for preserving muscle mass and improving strength following BS. Further research is warranted to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and validate these findings.",

    "abstract": "Given the growing evidence of the importance of durability in endurance performance, this study aimed to investigate the reliability of a triathlon-specific test protocol for assessing physiological determinants of fatigued running performance, that is, after strenuous cycling in well-trained triathletes of both sexes. On 2 occasions, 10 triathletes (5 females; maximal oxygen uptake [V˙O2peak] 60.4 [6.0] mL·min-1·kg-1) completed an incremental cycling test (∼2 W·kg-1, +20 W, 3 min) to exhaustion followed by a constant-workload segment at 85% of power at lactate threshold 2 (LT2) to reach 20 kJ·kg-1 (males) or 15 kJ·kg-1 (females) of total mechanical work. Subsequently, they performed an incremental running test to exhaustion (2.8 m·s-1, +0.4 m·s-1, 5 min + 30-s rest) to assess fatigued V˙O2peak, oxygen cost, and lactate thresholds. Energy expenditure and carbohydrate/fat oxidation were calculated during all submaximal work rates. All diagnostic determinants of fatigued running performance showed good to excellent reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] ≥ .845), except for fractional utilization of V˙O2peak at LT2 (ICC = .193), along with small measurement errors (typical error ≤ 3.6%) for all determinants. In contrast to the excellent reliability of energy expenditure during constant-workload cycling (ICC = .940, typical error = 3.4%), substrate oxidation demonstrated limited reliability during constant cycling and submaximal fatigued running (ICC = .560-.928, typical error = 6.3%-19.6%). The triathlon-specific test protocol demonstrated high reliability for measures of fatigued running performance, comparable to fresh measurements in previous reliability studies, making it suitable for regular evaluation of triathletes.",

    "abstract": "Objective: This study examined the effects of different carbohydrate ingestion patterns on endurance cycling performance and gastrointestinal comfort. It was hypothesized that increasing carbohydrate availability in alignment with decreasing endogenous stores would optimize performance while minimizing gastrointestinal discomfort. Methods: Twelve trained male cyclists completed three randomized trials involving a 180-min intermittent cycling preload, a 15-min all-out performance test, and a maximal sprint to exhaustion. Participants ingested 90 g/hr of carbohydrates in an increasing (INC), decreasing (DEC), or constant (CON) pattern. Performance, substrate oxidation, rate of perceived exertion, and gastrointestinal comfort were assessed. Results: Carbohydrate distribution during exercise had no effect on 15-min all-out performance test (mean [95% confidence limits]: INC-CON -0.1% [-9.9, 11]; INC-DEC 5.9% [-8.6, 23]; DEC-CON -5.4 [-17, 7.8]) or time to exhaustion (INC-CON -0.6 [-3.8, 2.7]; INC-DEC 0.1 [-4.0, 4.4]; DEC-CON -0.7 [-4.0, 2.6]) performance. Carbohydrate oxidation was higher in DEC versus CON (7.1%; 2.7, 11.7) and versus INC (5.8%; -4.1, 15). Conversely, fat oxidation was lower in DEC versus CON (13%; -23, -1.8), while other contrasts were unclear. RPE was lower, but increased more over time in INC than CON. Nausea (standardized difference 1.2; 0.04, 2.3), stomach fullness (0.55; -0.15, 1.27), and abdominal cramping (0.84; -0.03, 1.7) increased over time in INC versus DEC. Conclusion: Carbohydrate intake distribution had little clear effect on performance, though a decreasing pattern may support oxidation and gut comfort later in exercise. Even intake remains advisable, but uneven patterns may be acceptable when needed.",

As such, a fully plant-based, i.e. vegan, diet may be suboptimal for the maintenance of skeletal muscle mass later in life.

Seventy-two community-dwelling individuals aged ≥ 65 years with a BMI between 23 and 32 kg/m The results will provide valuable insights regarding the implications of consuming a vegan diet later in life for skeletal muscle and other health outcomes, and may contribute to the substantiation of the envisaged more plant-based dietary guidelines.

    "abstract": "High-intensity exercise promotes visceral adipose tissue (VAT) breakdown in females via the hypothalamic ERα pathway, and exogenous lactate infusion combined with aerobic training (AT) mimics this effect. However, whether lactate administration can independently mediate hypothalamic plasticity and VAT catabolism as a standalone nutritional strategy remains unexplored. Firstly, using a two-factor design (Lactate × AT) in female SD rats, we showed that long-term exogenous lactate infusion independently induced co-expression of Estrogen receptor α (ERα) and Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) and elevated local field potential spectral power in specific bands. These neural adaptations were accompanied by increased resting metabolic rate, enhanced fat oxidation, and enhanced lipolysis, thereby preventing excessive VAT accumulation induced by a high-fat diet. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition confirmed that Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Gamma Coactivator 1-α (PGC-1α) acts as a co-upstream signal of ERα and BDNF mediating this process. Our findings reveal that standalone lactate administration induces functional plasticity and metabolic reprogramming through the VMH PGC-1α-ERα pathway, independent of exercise, and effectively suppresses pathological VAT accumulation in female rats. This study identifies potential nutritional interventions and mechanistic targets for preventing female-centered obesity.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is a global health concern affecting multiple organs and is influenced by genetics, diet, and physical activity. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) regulates lipid and glucose metabolism, while gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) is a marker of liver function.The combined effect of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and livergol, a liver-protective supplement, on these markers in obesity remains unclear. The primary aim of this study was to specifically examine the effects of 8 weeks of HIIT and livergolsupplementation, administered individually and in combination, on the gene expression levels of PPARγ and the enzymatic activity of GGT in the liver and adipose tissues of obese male Wistar rats. In this experimental study, forty male Wistar rats (8 weeks old, weighing 246 ± 15 g) were fed a high-fat diet to induce obesity, then randomly divided into four groups (n = 10): control, HIIT, livergol, and HIIT + livergol. The interventions lasted for 8 weeks. The study setting was laboratory-based. Adipose tissue and liver samples were collected one day after the last session in a fasting state and analyzed in the reference laboratory. The primary outcome measures were PPARγ gene expression (RT-PCR) in adipose tissues and GGT enzymatic activity (biochemical assay) in liver samples. Data were analyzed using Shapiro-Wilk, Levene, two-way ANOVA, and Bonferroni post hoc (P ≤ 0.05) tests. Results are presented as mean ± standard deviation with 95% confidence interval (CI). Among 40 obese male Wistar rats, HIIT combined with Livergolsupplementation markedly improved metabolic health by substantially upregulating PPARγ expression in the HIIT and HIIT + Livergolgroups (P < 0.05) while reducing GGT activity compared to controls (where GGT was significantly higher(P < 0.05). PPARγ expression increased by 317% in the HIIT group, 267% in the livergolgroup, and 435% in the HIIT + livergolgroup compared with controls. GGT activity decreased by 27.4%, 32.3%, and 23.9% in HIIT, livergol, and HIIT + livergolgroups, respectively, compared with the control group. Enhanced expression of PPARγ likely drives improved adipocyte differentiation, fatty acid oxidation, and insulin signaling in adipose and liver tissues, thereby attenuating dyslipidemia and hyperglycemia; these effects are amplified in the combined group. Simultaneously, the observed reductions in GGT activity indicate diminished hepatic oxidative stress and inflammation. Livergol's silymarin content appears to potentiate this hepatoprotection by scavenging reactive oxygen species, and High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) emerges as a promising adjunctive strategy for obesity management.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of acute exposure to severe normobaric hypoxia vs. normoxia on whole-body fat oxidation and muscle desaturation kinetics over a wide range of identical relative and absolute intensities. Thirteen active men performed i) two maximal incremental tests to determine maximal oxygen uptake (V̇O2peak) in normobaric hypoxia [FiO2=13.2%, 3740 m] and normoxia [FiO2=20.7%, 375 m], and ii) two submaximal graded tests, after overnight fasting, to assess fat oxidation and muscle desaturation kinetics as a function of exercise intensity in each condition. Fat oxidation kinetics were measured using indirect calorimetry and characterized using a sinusoidal model. Vastus lateralis desaturation kinetics were measured using near-infrared spectroscopy and the tissue saturation index (TSI), and modeled through a double linear model. Compared with the relative (%V̇O2peak) or absolute (%V̇O2peak,nomoxia) exercise intensity, absolute fat oxidation rates (g·min-1) were significantly higher in hypoxia than in normoxia, ranging from 55 to 85 %V̇O2peak (p≤0.023) and from 35 to 60 %V̇O2peak,normoxia (p≤0.027), respectively. The TSI was lower in hypoxia than in normoxia when compared at relative or absolute exercise intensity (p≤0.004), and muscle desaturation reached a maximal level only in hypoxia at high exercise intensity (p≤0.014). Compared with normoxia, acute exposure to severe normobaric hypoxia enhanced fat oxidation pathways during moderate-to-high relative and low-to-moderate absolute exercise intensities while allowing greater and maximal muscle desaturation. These findings highlight the relevance of considering both relative and absolute intensities when comparing fat oxidation during exercise in hypoxia and normoxia and suggest that maximal muscle desaturation is not a limiting factor for fat oxidation during exercise.",

Exercise and intermittent fasting (IF) are non-pharmacological strategies known to improve glucose homeostasis, yet their renal protective roles remain underexplored. To explore how exercise and IF with glibenclamide therapy can have a therapeutic potential in diabetic nephropathy as adjuncts or alternatives to conventional pharmacological treatment by focusing on the polyol pathway as a mechanistic target. Type 2 diabetes was induced in rats using an 8-week high-fat diet followed by a single low dose of streptozotocin (STZ). Animals were treated for 4 weeks with glibenclamide (1 mg/kg/day), exercise, IF, or combined triple therapy. Biochemical, molecular, and histopathological analyses were performed to evaluate renal function, oxidative stress, inflammatory mediators, polyol pathway activity, apoptotic markers, and tissue architecture. Untreated diabetic rats developed hyperglycemia, renal impairment, oxidative stress, and inflammation with marked polyol pathway activation. Triple therapy significantly improved glycemic control, restored antioxidant defenses, reduced pro-inflammatory and apoptotic markers, downregulated transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) expression, and preserved renal histology. The combination of glibenclamide, exercise, and IF provides synergistic protection against diabetes-induced nephropathy, primarily through modulation of the polyol pathway, antioxidant enhancement, and suppression of inflammation and fibrosis.",

    "abstract": "While acute exercise has been shown to alter subsequent energy intake in adolescents with obesity, the role of the exercise-induced energy expenditure and substrate oxidation remains unknown. The present study investigates the effect of energy expenditure and substrate oxidation rates during an acute walking exercise on subsequent appetitive responses in adolescents with obesity. Body composition and maximal aerobic capacities were assessed in 25 adolescents [8 males, 12-16 years] with obesity. They then realized a control condition without exercise [CON] and an exercise session [EX, 40-min walking at 4 km h Post-exercise energy intake was reduced on EX compared with CON [1083 ± 253 vs. 950 ± 226 kcal; p = 0.041], with reduced absolute protein intake [p = 0.011]. None of the appetite sensations differed between conditions. Pre-lunch explicit liking for fat decreased on EX compared with CON [p = 0.045], the implicit and explicit wanting for fat [p = 0.047 and p = 0.025 respectively] and explicit wanting for taste [p = 0.012] decreased from pre to post lunch after exercise. Energy Expenditure, fat and carbohydrate oxidation rates during exercise were not associated with subsequent appetitive measurements. Exercise-induced energy expenditure and substrate might not be associated with the short-term control of appetite and energy intake in adolescents with obesity, which remains to be confirmed by further studies evaluating the effect of various exercises inducing specific predominant fuel sources.",

    "abstract": "Lipid metabolism and lipid-derived signaling together ensure cellular and systemic homeostasis. Their dysregulation causes obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, NAFLD/MASH, and neurodegeneration throughout life. This review integrates central pathways, such as ACC-FASN-mediated de novo lipogenesis, lipid-droplet lipolysis, and mitochondrial and peroxisomal β-oxidation, and their regulation by insulin-PI3K-Akt, glucagon-cAMP-PKA, SREBPs, PPARs, and AMPK. We emphasize the mechanisms by which bioactive lipids like diacylglycerols, ceramides, eicosanoids, and endocannabinoids serve as second messengers linking nutrient state to insulin signaling, inflammation, and stress response; pathologic accumulation of these species enhances insulin resistance and lipotoxicity. Aging disrupts these axes via diminished catecholamine-stimulated lipolysis, defective fatty-acid oxidation, mitochondrial failure, and adipose depot redistribution, facilitating ectopic fat and postprandial dyslipidemia. We suggest a pathway-to-phenotype paradigm that connects lipid species and tissue environment to clinical phenotypes, allowing for mechanism-to-intervention alignment. Therapeutic avenues range from lipid lowering for atherogenic risk to novel agents targeting ACLY, ACC, FASN, CPT1, and nuclear receptors, with precision lifestyle intervention in diet and exercise. Translation is still heterogeneous because of isoform-dependent effects, safety trade-offs, and inconsistent adherence. We prioritize harmonization of lipidomics with multi-omics for stratifying patients, enriching responders, and bridging gaps between mechanistic understanding and clinical outcome, with focus on age-sensitive prevention and treatment for lipid-mediated metabolic disease.",

    "title": "Unlocking the benefits of aerobic exercise for MAFLD: a comprehensive mechanistic analysis.",
    "abstract": "Metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), characterized by abnormal accumulation of triglycerides (TG) and cholesterol in hepatocytes, is a globally prevalent chronic liver disease with a rising incidence that poses a severe threat to human health. In the absence of effective targeted drugs and long-term prognostic interventions for MAFLD, aerobic exercise, as a safe and accessible non-pharmacological strategy, is widely recognized to slow MAFLD progression. However, a systematic summary of its mechanisms in ameliorating MAFLD remains insufficient. This review integrates recent high-quality PubMed studies and classic models (e.g., high-fat diet-induced C57BL/6J mice, HepG2 cells) to analyze aerobic exercise's therapeutic effects on MAFLD and underlying molecular mechanisms. Aerobic exercise regulates MAFLD via a multi-dimensional network. SESN family signaling regulates hepatic lipid metabolism, improves insulin resistance, enhances antioxidant capacity, and promotes lipophagy. miRNA-mediated regulation modulates lipogenic gene expression, insulin signaling, and fatty acid oxidation via exercise-induced changes in key miRNAs and their upstream regulators or downstream targets. AMPK-centered energy metabolism orchestrates fatty acid β-oxidation promotion and de-novo lipogenesis suppression through its related pathways. Other key pathways include inhibiting lipogenesis via exercise-induced IL-6, blocking hepatic inflammation through brown adipose-derived Nrg4, optimizing lipid droplet-mitochondria interaction by regulating PLIN5 and Mfn-2, and suppressing ferroptosis via activating antioxidant pathways. Notably, mechanisms initially validated in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are equally applicable to MAFLD, as both are characterized by core metabolic dysfunction. Aerobic exercise alleviates MAFLD progression by orchestrating a complex regulatory network involving energy metabolism, stress response, post-transcriptional modification, and inter-organ crosstalk. This review clarifies the key molecular targets and signaling pathways underlying aerobic exercise's therapeutic effects, providing a theoretical basis for exploring potential targeted interventions and guiding future drug development for MAFLD.",

Evaluation of acute metabolic and physiologic responses obtained from sprint interval trainings performed by low cadence/high resistance and high cadence/low resistance. J Strength Cond Res 40(2): e117-e124, 2026-This study aimed to compare the acute metabolic and physiologic responses obtained from different sprint interval training (SIT) protocols performed by low cadence/high resistance and high cadence/low resistance. Ten moderately trained men completed two 6 × 30-second all-out SIT protocols with 4 minutes recovery periods as follows: (a) traditional fixed-load protocol, that is, using 7.5% of body mass (BM), (traditional SIT [SIT TRAD ]) and (b) adjusted-load protocol, that is, using an initial load of 5% of BM and then adjusting load for subsequent bouts based on the criterion of ≥120 rpm mean cadence for the last 5 seconds of each 30-second bout, (modified SIT [SIT MOD ]). Gas exchange variables and blood lactate concentration ([La]) were measured before, during, and after both protocols. Total net O 2 consumption and 3-hour postexercise recovery fat oxidation values were similar between SIT TRAD and SIT MOD ( p > 0.05). However, SIT MOD demonstrated a greater anaerobic contribution than SIT TRAD ( p < 0.001), despite similar aerobic contributions ( p = 0.32). The mean cadence was significantly higher in SIT MOD (139 ± 3) than that in SIT TRAD (98 ± 5 rpm; p < 0.001). SIT MOD elicited both the highest peak delta [La] (∆[La]) at the end of the session (19.6 ± 1.4 vs. 17.8 ± 1.8 mmol·L -1 , respectively; p = 0.003) and higher ∆[La] values at the 30th, 60th, 90th, and 120th minute of recovery compared with SIT TRAD (11.1 ± 1.4 vs. 8.3 ± 2.2, 4.5 ± 0.6 vs. 3.1 ± 1.1, 3.2 ± 0.8 vs. 1.9 ± 0.8, and 2.1 ± 0.9 vs. 0.7 ± 0.6 mmol·L -1 , respectively; p < 0.05). In conclusion, the high-cadence/low-resistance protocol (i.e., SIT MOD ) resulted in a greater anaerobic contribution than the traditional fixed-load protocol that leaded low cadence/high resistance (i.e., SIT TRAD ).",

    "title": "Effects of Sex and Obesity on Lipid Metabolism During Low Intensity Exercise and Post-Exercise Period.",
    "abstract": "Whether there are sex- and obesity-differences in fat oxidation and free fatty acid (FFA) mobilization during low intensity exercise is unclear. We studied 21 (9 females) participants without and 24 (16 females) with obesity during 5 hours of treadmill walking (~2 mph). We measured energy expenditure (EE) and substrate oxidation (indirect calorimetry) and FFA-palmitate kinetics and oxidation with isotopic palmitate infusions ([U- 13 C]palmitate, and [1- 14 C]palmitate or [9,10- 3 H]palmitate). Skeletal muscle samples were collected at 1.5 and 5 hours of exercise and 24 hours after exercise. We calculated fatty acid (FA) oxidation, palmitate rate of disappearance (Rd), and intramyocellular triglyceride (imTG)-derived palmitate fractions during exercise. At rest, EE was 1.24 ± 0.23 kcal/min, with FA oxidation contributing 49 ± 13% of total EE. During exercise, FA oxidation accounted for 73 ± 8% of EE, and was not different between males and females (p = 0.34). Plasma FFA-palmitate concentrations were greater in females than males (p = 0.003), mean palmitate Rd and plasma palmitate clearance were not different (p = 0.32 and 0.14, respectively). Plasma FFA-palmitate Rd was correlated with EE (r = 0.49, p = 0.001), with a proportionally greater Rd response in females (p < 0.001). Although absolute plasma FFA-palmitate oxidation rates were comparable between sexes, the percent contribution of FFA-palmitate oxidation to EE was greater in females (p = 0.001). During exercise, imTG-palmitate fraction amounts remained stable. Lipid oxidation during low-intensity exercise is similar in males and females, independent of obesity, although next-day values were greater in participants with normal weight. Energy expenditure correlates with plasma palmitate disappearance rates, but is proportionally greater in females. Contribution of plasma palmitate oxidation is greater in females than in males during low intensity exercise.",

    "abstract": "Exercise provides multisystemic and multidimensional benefits to health and human performance. Still, the optimal parameters required to improve pain and function across various settings and populations continue to be debated. Although researchers have attempted to alter various exercise-specific kinematics to optimize principles associated with successful training, such as adaptation, overload, continuity, volume, intensity, and specificity, emerging evidence suggests that the additive effects of AC, DC, and microcurrent may accelerate performance and rehabilitation. Microcurrent elicits cellular adaptations to attenuate pain and soreness while driving tissue growth, cellular remodeling, and fat reduction associated with tissue repair and recovery. At the same time, TENS and IFC facilitate central and peripheral pain reduction associated with acute, subacute, and chronic neuromusculoskeletal conditions. In contrast, NMES and FES stimulate alpha motor neurons and the muscle fibers they innervate, improving muscle mass, strength, and composition in neurologically impaired and orthopedic patients. Often considered exercise emulators, FES and NMES induce myokines to manage oxidation, hypertrophy, angiogenesis, inflammation, and extracellular matrix, allowing muscles to perform longer, fatigue less, and recover faster, which are key parameters related to athletic performance. Electric modalities are valuable strategies to drive the peripheral and central changes necessary to make training more efficient, mainly when presented in conjunction with exercise. Given that no single electric modality has been shown to optimize pain, inflammation, repair, performance, and recovery, technologies that offer multiple waveforms may be particularly advantageous. Future clinical trials should consider this possibility further.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic Associated Fatty Liver Disease (MAFLD) is a prevalent chronic condition with limited therapeutic options, making lifestyle interventions a primary strategy. This study investigated whether exercise, alone or with dietary modifications, mitigates HFD-induced alterations in rats of both sexes. The motor coordination, plasma glucose and irisin levels, oxidative stress and inflammatory biomarkers (catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, malondialdehyde and myeloperoxidase) in liver and muscle, and hepatic Nrf2, NF-κB, and UCP-2 expression were evaluated. Rats were fed a HFD for 3 months, followed by 2 months of interventions consisting of exercise and a shift to a standard diet (SD) or antioxidant-rich diet. Control and HFD groups received pellet and HFD, respectively, for the full 5 months. The results showed improvements in weight gain, motor performance, and antioxidant profiles in tissues when exercise was combined with dietary changes in both sexes. Exercise alone was enough to improve motor coordination in males. Plasma glucose and irisin recovered control values, especially when exercise was combined with a healthier diet in both sexes. Nrf2, NF-κB and UCP-2 expression, altered by the HFD, were also restored after interventions. Overall, the combination of exercise and an antioxidant-rich diet produced the most pronounced improvements across all parameters. In conclusion, combining exercise and a healthier diet, especially rich in antioxidants, led to marked improvements in motor function and plasma and tissue biomarkers with slight differences between females and males.",

    "abstract": "Follistatin is a potent regulator of various TGF-β superfamily members, including myostatin (MSTN) and activin A. Previous studies have shown that follistatin is crucial in enhancing myogenesis during acute muscle injury. The mechanism by which fibro-adipogenic progenitors (FAPs)-specific follistatin influences muscle homeostasis in obese mice remains unknown. Therefore, we investigated the physiological role of follistatin in PDGFRα-positive FAPs in the regulation of muscle homeostasis and exercise in obese mice. A PDGFRα-specific follistatin knockout (follistatin KO) mouse model was generated using PDGFRα-GFP-CreER We showed that follistatin KO mice had reduced expression of Fst in skeletal muscle and white adipose tissue. We also showed that follistatin KO mice exhibited decreased exercise performance and altered skeletal homeostasis during obesity. Deletion of follistatin in FAPs activated the MSTN: Activin A/SMADs signaling pathways, which negatively impacted muscle homeostasis. Furthermore, follistatin KO mice showed reduced muscle mass, increased muscle degradation, and atrophic myofibers. Mitochondrial biogenesis, oxidative phosphorylation, and fatty acid oxidation were also altered in the skeletal muscles of follistatin KO mice. Follistatin plays a protective role in mice by maintaining the metabolic health of skeletal muscles; it restores muscle function during HFD challenge, thereby reducing diet-induced obesity-related complications.",

Physical exercise is a key strategy to counteract these effects by improving insulin sensitivity and modulating inflammatory and metabolic pathways. This study investigated the effects of resistance training in obese Swiss mice divided into Control (CTRL), Sedentary Obese (SOB), and Trained Obese (TOB) groups. Obesity was induced by a high-fat diet (HFD), and TOB animals underwent an 8-week resistance training protocol. Exercise restored hepatic insulin signaling by increasing AKT phosphorylation and reduced the expression of CDK4 and CDK6, proteins linked to cell proliferation, while decreasing Metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) activity. Moreover, training enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative capacity, increasing ATP5 protein expression. Importantly, resistance training epigenetically modulated the MTCH2 promoter region, reversing the obesity-induced upregulation of MTCH2 expression. These adaptations suggest that exercise mitigates hepatic metabolic dysfunction through molecular and epigenetic mechanisms. Collectively, our findings provide novel evidence that resistance exercise promotes mitochondrial and insulin signaling remodeling, reinforcing its therapeutic potential in obesity management.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the role and mechanism of long noncoding RNA nuclear-enriched abundant transcript 1 (NEAT1) in macrophage ferroptosis during atherosclerosis (AS). The clinical characteristics and disease severity were assessed in 84 patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). The role of NEAT1 in high-fat diet-induced AS and the impact of exercise were examined in APOE NEAT1 expression and iron levels were correlated with disease severity in CHD patients. In THP-1 cells, oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) induced NEAT1 expression, ferroptosis marker ACSL4, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and mitochondrial abnormalities. Knockdown of NEAT1 reversed these effects. NEAT1 overexpression increased pSTAT3, ACSL4, and ROS production, reversed by STAT3 inhibitor. NEAT1 physically interacted with STAT3 via FBXW11. Knockdown of NEAT1 promoted pSTAT3 ubiquitination, reduced ACSL4 expression, and reversed ox-LDL effects. NEAT1 deletion attenuated macrophage ferroptosis and AS in APOE NEAT1 plays a crucial role in macrophage ferroptosis during AS. Targeting NEAT1 or exercising may provide therapeutic interventions against AS.",

    "abstract": "Skeletal muscle plays various roles in physiological stress, such as movement, hormone secretion and oxidative metabolism. MicroRNA (miRNA) is involved in skeletal muscle development and fiber type transformation. Our previous studies have shown that miR-130a-3p is an important regulator of glycolipid metabolism and participates in the aerobic oxidation process. However, its potential impact on skeletal muscle development and muscle fiber type transformation by enhancement of aerobic metabolism of nutrients remains unexplored. Mice with knockout and overexpression of miR-130a-3p were utilized to investigate its impact on mouse muscle development via assessments of body composition, metabolic activity in cages, and running performance. The influence of miR-130a-3p on muscle cell proliferation, differentiation, and fiber type was assessed following transfection of C2C12 cells. In this study, we found that miR-130a-3p overexpression significantly inhibited weight gain and fat content in mice, while promoting oxidative metabolism and improving exercise tolerance. Upregulation of miR-130a-3p in gastrocnemius (GAS) increased the expression of genes controlling cell proliferation, such as proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), cyclin D, and cyclin E, and decreased the protein expression of myosin heavy chain (MyHC), myogenic differentiation 1 (MyoD) and myopoietin (MyoG). In addition, miR-130a-3p overexpression significantly increased the proportion of type I fibers and decreased the proportion of type IIB fibers in GAS. These phenotype were also observed when miR-130a-3p was overexpressed in differentiated C2C12 myoblasts. Mechanistically, miR-130a-3p can promote the proliferation of myoblasts and inhibit the differentiation of myoblasts. Importantly, miR-130a-3p was proved to target the transforming growth factor beta receptor 2 (TGFβR2). Taken together, miR-130a-3p could be a potential therapeutic target that regulates fiber type conversion during skeletal muscle development and improves skeletal muscle energy metabolism during exercise through regulating TGFβR2 signalling pathway.",

    "title": "Muscle Insulin Resistance Elicits Muscle Atrophy in Obesity.",
    "abstract": "This review comprehensively highlights the molecular and cellular pathways that link insulin resistance (IR) to muscle atrophy. Skeletal muscle IR is a key driver of muscle atrophy in obesity. It disrupts metabolic homeostasis, leading to impaired glucose uptake and utilization. Crucially, IR shifts the balance in skeletal muscle from anabolic to catabolic processes by simultaneously inhibiting protein synthesis and promoting proteolysis, resulting in a progressive decline of muscle mass and function. This review summarizes how defective insulin signaling activates a cascade of intracellular events that accelerate muscle wasting in obese individuals. The nexus between IR and muscle atrophy in obesity involves multiple interconnected mechanisms, including mitochondrial dysfunction, elevated inflammation and oxidative stress, and compromised satellite cell function-essential for muscle repair and regeneration. The prevalence of IR, which rises with age and is exacerbated by sedentary behavior and poor nutrition, underscores the importance of understanding these signaling pathways. Elucidating these mechanisms is critical for developing effective interventions to combat muscle loss and enhance metabolic health in the obese population.",

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular complications are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), which is recognized as a major independent risk factor for coronary artery disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, and heart failure. The interrelationship between metabolic dysfunction and cardiovascular disease is complex and multifactorial, involving hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, inflammation, and oxidative stress. Evidence indicates that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and induction of the unfolded protein response (UPR) contribute to metabolic dysregulation and vascular dysfunction. However, the specific role of beta cell-derived UPR mediators, particularly C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), in coordinating this interorgan axis between the endocrine pancreas and the cardiovascular system remains poorly understood. To determine the role of beta cell CHOP in mediating the link between T2D and cardiovascular complications, we specifically deleted CHOP in beta cells. Thus, male and female β-cell β-cell This study elucidates CHOP in pancreatic beta cells as a key mechanism linking T2D to cardiovascular complications. Deleting CHOP in beta cells reduces metabolic and cardiovascular issues, underscoring the role of beta cell stress in the connection between T2D and cardiovascular disease. These findings suggest that CHOP may be a potential target for preventing T2D-related cardiovascular complications.",

Increasing attention has been paid to modifiable lifestyle factors that influence its onset and progression. Among these, chronic high‑fat diet (HFD) consumption has emerged as a significant and potentially reversible risk factor for cognitive decline. Both epidemiological and experimental studies have consistently linked HFD‑particularly diets rich in saturated fatty acids‑to impairments in memory, attention and executive functions. Mechanistically, HFD induces neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, insulin resistance and gut microbiota dysbiosis, which collectively disrupt synaptic plasticity and neuronal survival. Individual susceptibility factors such as age, sex and the presence of the apolipoprotein E ε4 allele may further exacerbate these pathological effects. This review also highlights promising intervention strategies, including adherence to Mediterranean or Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension dietary patterns, regular physical exercise, pharmacological approaches and gut microbiota modulation. A comprehensive understanding of these multifactorial pathways is essential for developing targeted preventive and therapeutic interventions to mitigate HFD‑associated neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "Metformin is the first-line pharmacotherapy for treating hyperglycemia, and it lowers cardiovascular disease risk. Prior work suggests that metformin can, however, interfere with metabolic adaptations to exercise. To date, no work has tested if metformin (Met) alters exercise training mediated vascular insulin sensitivity, and whether this is exercise intensity dependent. This work aimed to test the hypothesis that Met blunts vascular insulin sensitivity in an intensity-based manner among adults at risk for metabolic syndrome. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, participants were randomly assigned to low-intensity exercise plus placebo (∼55% VO2max 5d/wk, LoEx + PL, n = 22) or metformin (2000 mg/d, LoEx + Met, n = 21) and high-intensity exercise plus placebo (∼85% VO2max 5d/wk, HiEx + PL, n = 24) or metformin (HiEx + Met, n = 24) for 16 weeks. A 120-minute euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp (40 mU/m2/min, 90 mg/dL) was conducted pre and post treatment to assess macrovascular insulin sensitivity via brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (%FMD, conduit artery) as well as microvascular insulin sensitivity using contrast-enhanced ultrasound (eg, microvascular blood volume [MBV, perfusion] and microvascular blood flow [MBF]). Fasting and clamp-derived glucose, insulin, inflammatory measures (eg, endothelin-1 [ET-1], tumor necrosis factor α [TNF-α], soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products [sRAGE]), and nitric oxide (nitrite/nitrate) were assessed. Aerobic fitness (maximal oxygen consumption [VO2max]) and body composition (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry [DXA]) were also analyzed. LoEx + PL and HiEx + PL increased VO2max (both P < .05), while there was no change after LoEx + Met or HiEx + Met. Body fat was reduced following HiEx + PL and HiEx + Met only (both P < .05). Met blunted the increase in insulin-stimulated FMDallometric and MBF seen with LoEx + PL and HiEx + PL (P < .05). Met also attenuated the reductions in fasting glucose, ET-1, and TNF-α compared with LoEx + PL and HiEx + PL (P < .05). Met blunts exercise training-mediated increases in vascular insulin sensitivity at the levels of conduit arteries and capillaries, in parallel with altered inflammation and glycemic benefits.",

Oxidative stress, apoptosis, and fibrosis are central to its pathophysiology. This study aimed to investigate the synergistic cardioprotective effects of thymoquinone (TQ) and aerobic exercise, with a particular focus on the Apaf1/Cycs-mediated apoptotic pathway. Male C57BL/6J mice were randomly assigned to five groups: Control, HFpEF, HFpEF + TQ, HFpEF + exercise, and HFpEF + TQ + exercise. HFpEF was induced by a high-fat diet combined with Nω-Nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) administration for 10 weeks. TQ (50 mg/kg/day) and aerobic exercise (60% of maximal velocity, 5 days/week for 12 weeks) were applied as interventions.  The combined treatment of TQ and aerobic exercise significantly reduced myocardial fibrosis, apoptosis, and oxidative stress compared with either intervention alone. Mechanistically, the combination downregulated the interaction between Apaf1 and Cycs, thereby suppressing cardiomyocyte apoptosis. These findings demonstrate that TQ and aerobic exercise exert synergistic cardioprotective effects in HFpEF by attenuating oxidative stress, fibrosis, and apoptosis through inhibition of the Apaf1/Cycs apoptotic pathway. The results provide new insights into adjunctive therapeutic strategies for HFpEF management.",

    "abstract": "Liver diseases, particularly non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), have grown to be significant global health issues. These conditions are strongly associated with metabolic syndrome, obesity, and diabetes. The management of chronic illnesses still necessitates lifestyle changes, such as improved diet and increased physical activity, despite advances in pharmaceutical therapies. With their numerous bioactive constituents, natural products have shown significant hepatoprotective effects through lipid metabolism, oxidative stress, and inflammatory modulation. Key natural substances, including resveratrol, curcumin, and silymarin, have demonstrated potential in clinical and experimental settings by influencing molecular pathways essential to liver health. Simultaneously, exercise interventions, specifically resistance and aerobic training, have successfully improved insulin sensitivity, decreased intrahepatic fat, and enhanced metabolic performance. Recent research suggests that the combined use of natural products and exercise represents a novel therapeutic approach. This approach may offer a therapeutic synergy that targets underlying biological mechanisms and circumvents some of the limitations of existing therapies. Furthermore, probiotic-induced microbiota modification and the gut-liver axis provide new perspectives on the holistic treatment of liver disease. This review underscores the urgent need for more studies to maximize integrative therapy approaches, identifies current research gaps, and summarizes recent developments on the combined effects of exercise and natural products in preventing and treating liver disease. These revelations open the door to creative treatments that enhance liver health and lessen the prevalence of liver illnesses worldwide, highlighting the crucial role of further research in this field.",

    "abstract": "AMPK (5'-AMP-activated protein kinase) is an energetic sensor for metabolic regulation and integration. Here, we employed CRISPR/Cas9 to generate non-activatable Ampkα knock-in (KI) mice with mutation of threonine 172 phosphorylation site to alanine, circumventing the limitations of previous genetic interventions that disrupt the protein stoichiometry. KI mice of Ampkα2, but not Ampkα1, demonstrated phenotypic changes with increased fat-to-lean mass, impaired endurance exercise capacity, and diminished mitochondrial maximal respiration and conductance in skeletal muscle. Integrated temporal multi-omic analysis (proteomics/phosphoproteomics/metabolomics) in skeletal muscle at rest and during exercise establishes a pleiotropic yet imperative role of Ampkα2 T172 activation for glycolytic and oxidative metabolism, mitochondrial respiration, and contractile function. Importantly, there is a significant overlap of skeletal muscle proteomic changes in Ampkα2 T172A KI mice with that of type 2 diabetic patients. Our findings suggest that Ampkα2 T172 activation is critical for exercise performance and energy transduction in skeletal muscle and may serve as a therapeutic target for type 2 diabetes.",

    "title": "Exercise-mediated amelioration of high-fat diet-induced kidney injury: implications of microRNA regulation.",
    "abstract": "Obesity-related kidney injury has become a critical health concern, driven by metabolic disturbances, chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, and structural remodeling. While exercise is widely recognized for its broad health benefits, including its ability to mitigate obesity-related complications by improving metabolic homeostasis, reducing inflammation, and enhancing antioxidative capacity, its specific role in protecting renal function - particularly through the modulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) - remains insufficiently understood. This study investigated the effects of an 8-week moderate-intensity treadmill exercise intervention on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced kidney injury in a murine model. Chronic HFD feeding resulted in significant renal dysfunction, evidenced by elevated filtration markers (urinary total protein, urinary microalbumin, urinary creatinine, and serum creatinine) and injury biomarkers (neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, cystatin C, and kidney injury molecule 1), alongside structural abnormalities, such as glomerular hypertrophy, mesangial expansion, and fibrosis. These changes were accompanied by increased pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β), heightened oxidative stress (elevated malondialdehyde, reduced glutathione, glutathione s-transferase, and superoxide dismutase), and dysregulation of several miRNAs, such as miR-150-5p and miR-182-5p, which are known to exacerbate renal injury. Exercise significantly alleviated the adverse effects of HFD by improving renal function, reducing structural damage, suppressing inflammation, enhancing antioxidative capacity, and downregulating miR-150-5p and miR-182-5p. These findings underscore the therapeutic potential of exercise in mitigating obesity-related kidney injury and provide novel insights into its renoprotective effects mediated by miRNA regulation.",

    "title": "Increased Skeletal Muscle Oxidative Capacity Augments the Myokine Response to Whole Body Vibration.",
    "abstract": "The role of skeletal muscle health in preventing and ameliorating chronic disease is emerging. The improvements in skeletal muscle metabolism are likely mediated by myokines, such as myostatin, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and decorin. Whether basal skeletal muscle health contributes to the myokine response to whole body vibration (WBV), an exercise mimetic, has yet to be elucidated. Data from 63 young adults (32.5 ± 0.7 years, 57.1% female, 42.9% non-Hispanic Black) were included from a longitudinal twin cohort study. Skeletal muscle oxidative capacity (SMOC) was determined using near-infrared spectroscopy by measuring the rate of skeletal muscle oxygen consumption after stimulation and was represented as a rate constant averaged over three trials (avgRC). The acute WBV protocol consisted of 10 cycles of 1 min of vibration exercise followed by 30 s of standing rest. Blood was collected at baseline (PRE), immediately post, and 1, 3, and 24 h post-WBV and myokine concentrations of IL-6, myostatin, and decorin were measured at each of these timepoints. Participants were divided into two groups by SMOC: low SMOC (avgRC < 1.82) and high SMOC (avgRC > 2.13). Participant characteristics including age, body mass index, body fat percentage, handgrip, and skeletal muscle index were similar between groups. SMOC was positively associated with myostatin at baseline (ß = 564.6, SE = 232.4, P = 0.045) and 24 h following WBV (ß = 661.0, SE = 189.4, P = 0.029). In addition, a significantly higher overall myostatin ( P = 0.026) and IL-6 response ( P = 0.001) to WBV was observed in the high SMOC group compared with the low SMOC group. Higher SMOC is associated with a greater myostatin and IL-6 response to acute WBV. These data suggest that a higher SMOC at baseline may positively impact the myokine response to WBV, independent of adiposity, and demonstrate the importance of skeletal muscle health on preventing and ameliorating chronic disease.",

Participants were categorized into four groups based on their self-reported training regimens: dietary-only (Group C), aerobic fat oxidation (Group F), high-intensity interval training (Group H), and resistance training (Group R). Subjects followed their specialized routines through online and offline sources for at least 12 weeks. Groups F, H, and R demonstrated statistically lower body weight as well as waist-to-hip ratio and body fat percent levels, when assessed against Group C (P < 0.01). The combination of resistance training with specific benefits produced larger reductions in waist-to-hip ratio, together with android fat mass, primarily observed among male participants (P < 0.01). The participants in Group H demonstrated the greatest decrease in body fat percentage among female subjects (P < 0.01), even though Group R participants achieved beneficial results, although their adherence level was less than ideal. Participants from all experimental groups maintained similar levels of muscle mass. The hybrid online and offline approach effectively enhanced adherence and engagement, demonstrating its scalability and potential for managing obesity.",

    "abstract": "Studies showed that metabolic imbalances during pregnancy in obesity impair the maternal-fetal axis, resulting in fetal growth disturbances with higher risk later in life. Since research has linked many of maternal and fetal sequelae to placental dysfunction, we tested if treatment with an anti-diabetic drug (metformin) or lifestyle interventions improve maternal body weight, placental status or fetal growth. Mice were either fed a control or high-fat diet. After mating, high-fat diet mice were split into 4 subgroups, 1 received no intervention while the other 3 received either metformin treatment, a nutritional intervention (NI) or an exercise intervention (RUN). At gestational day 15.5, mice were sacrificed. All interventions improved body weight of high-fat diet dams, but only NI and RUN maintained fetal growth compared to HFD. Investigation of the placenta showed that (i) NI reduced lipid accumulation in the labyrinth zone (LZ) but neither NI nor RUN attenuated calcification and oxidative stress. Endothelial gammaH2AX staining was decreased in the LZ by both NI and RUN. (ii) Metformin did not attenuate lipid accumulation in the LZ, placental calcification and oxidative stress, however, protein levels of the endothelial cell marker CD31 were restored in whole placenta lysates. No changes were detected for fetal vessel capillary surface or length of the LZ under any intervention group. Although all tested interventions had beneficial effects on the mother and the placental-fetal unit, NI seems to be most promising. Our findings highlight that preventive strategies for women with obesity should aim for pre-counseling advisory service. In particular, NI and RUN protected from endothelial stress response and metformin was vasculo-protective, offering strategies to preserve the physiological placental-fetal unit and materno-fetal nutrient supply.",

    "title": "Physiological Conditions, Bioactive Ingredients, and Drugs Stimulating Non-Shivering Thermogenesis as a Promising Treatment Against Diabesity.",
    "abstract": "Obesity (lipotoxicity) results from a chronic imbalance between energy intake and expenditure. It is strongly associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM, glucotoxicity) and considered a major risk factor for the development of metabolic complications. Their convergence constitutes \"diabesity\", representing a major challenge for public health worldwide. Limited treatment efficacy highlights the need for novel, multi-targeted therapies. Non-shivering thermogenesis (NST), mediated by brown and beige adipose tissue and skeletal muscle, has emerged as a promising therapy due to its capacity to increase energy expenditure and improve metabolic health. Also, skeletal muscle plays a central role in glucose uptake and lipid oxidation, further highlighting its relevance in diabesity. This review explores current and emerging knowledge on physiological stimuli, including cold exposure, physical activity, and fasting, as well as bioactive ingredients and drugs that stimulate NST in thermogenic tissues. Special emphasis is placed on melatonin as a potential regulator of mitochondrial function and energy balance. The literature search was conducted using MEDLINE and Web of Science. Studies were selected based on scientific relevance, novelty, and mechanistic insight; prioritizing human and high-quality rodent research published in peer-reviewed journals. Evidence shows that multiple interventions enhance NST, leading to improved glucose metabolism, reduced fat accumulation, and increased energy expenditure in humans and/or rodents. Melatonin, in particular, shows promise in modulating thermogenesis through organelle-molecular pathways and mitochondrial protective effects. In conclusion, a multi-target approach through the activation of NST by physiological, nutritional, and pharmacological agents offers an effective and safe treatment for diabesity. Further research is needed to confirm these effects in clinical practice and support their use as effective therapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) is a progressive liver disease linked to type 2 diabetes (T2D), obesity, and dyslipidaemia, which are all parts of the metabolic syndrome. In 2024, for non-cirrhotic MASH with mild to advanced fibrosis, resmetirom, a selective thyroid hormone receptor-β agonist, became the first FDA-approved treatment for this condition. By increasing β-oxidation and lipid metabolism, it minimises systemic thyroid or cardiac effects while reducing hepatic fat, inflammation, and fibrosis. Resmetirom is being developed for use in combination with lifestyle interventions, such as diet and exercise, to maximize patient benefit. Nevertheless, the lack of congruence between clinical trial populations and real-world payer criteria underscores access obstacles that necessitate policy reform. The successful delivery of screening programs depends on the education of providers from various disciplines and the establishment of uniform screening standards. Future studies should investigate the clinical application of resmetirom in combination with agents that may provide additional benefits, such as GLP-1 receptor agonists, SGLT2 inhibitors, and statins. These results are significant in light of recent long-term safety monitoring of these agents, particularly regarding the thyroid axis. Ensuring equitable uptake will be crucial, as it involves defining fair access through payer endpoints, conducting cost-effectiveness analysis, and considering patient-reported outcomes. Resmetirom represents a breakthrough in MASH management, offering potential metabolic benefits in conjunction with comprehensive clinical and lifestyle approaches.",

    "abstract": "G protein-coupled receptor 81 (GPR81) is a hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor that has been identified in recent years to be widely expressed in cells of a variety of tissues. It has been demonstrated that lactate (LA) is the sole endogenous, natural ligand for GPR81 under physiological conditions. However, the precise function of GPR81 in the regulation of arterial function remains to be elucidated. The present study constructed a mouse model of impaired arterial function by subjecting C57/BL6J female mice to a high-fat diet (HFD) and ovariectomy (OVX). The results demonstrated that mice with OVX and obesity exhibited increased arterial stiffness, accompanied by lipid metabolism disorder. Furthermore, a substantial quantity of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) was observed in the aortic sinus region, which is a critical factor in the development of atherosclerosis. However, the 8-week aerobic exercise intervention was found to be capable of effectively reversing these adverse effects. Concurrently, in ovariectomized obese mice, serum LA levels exhibited a significant increase following exercise, as did the expression levels of aortic GPR81. Furthermore, an increase in cAMP-response element-binding protein 1 (CREB) phosphorylation was observed, which resulted in an enhancement of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression. Finally, the study confirmed that exercise did not restore arterial function-related indices in ovariectomized obese Gpr81 knockout mice. Thus, it was determined that exercise may enhance arterial function through the LA/GPR81/p-CREB/CREB/eNOS signaling pathway.",

    "abstract": "Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) arises from intersecting comorbidities involving inflammation, metabolic stress, and sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activation. To mirror this complexity, we established a clinically oriented 3-hit mouse model combining advanced age, a high-fat diet, and chronic NOS inhibition with NG-Nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME). We tested whether renal denervation (RDN) mitigates HFpEF by blunting SNS outflow and the ATP-P2X7-NLRP3 inflammasome axis, and in parallel probed the contribution of this pathway using pharmacologic and cellular approaches. 3-hit mice developed preserved ejection fraction with diastolic dysfunction, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, interstitial fibrosis, impaired exercise capacity, and elevated inflammatory cytokines, accompanied by increased myocardial ATP, activation of P2X7/NLRP3 signaling, oxidative stress, and pyroptosis.RDN lowered systemic and myocardial norepinephrine, suppressed P2X7-NLRP3 inflammasome activation, reduced fibrosis and cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area, improved E/e' and exercise capacity, and reduced oxidative stress and myocardial injury. In pharmacological intervention experiments, selective blockade with the P2X7 antagonist A438079 or the NLRP3 inhibitor MCC950 improved diastolic function and exercise capacity and attenuated myocardial fibrosis and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Complementary mechanistic studies in cardiomyocytes (H9c2 and primary neonatal rat cardiomyocytes) showed that ATP induced mitochondrial ROS accumulation, inflammasome activation, cytokine release, and cell injury, which were partially reversed by P2X7 knockdown or pharmacological antagonism. Together, these data validate a multi-hit HFpEF model and implicate an SNS-driven ATP-P2X7-NLRP3 axis as a potential therapeutic target. Both RDN and selective pathway inhibition improved diastolic function and attenuated ventricular remodeling, and inform future therapeutic strategies for HFpEF characterized by heightened sympathetic tone.",

    "abstract": "Ultrasound therapy has emerged as a promising non-invasive approach for fat reduction with the potential to improve metabolic health with both high-frequency (1-3 MHz) and low-frequency (35-300 kHz) ultrasound receiving FDA approval for waist circumference reduction between 2010 and 2014. This literature review aims to investigate the current state of research regarding the physiological mechanisms underlying ultrasound-induced lipolysis and lipid mobilization. While many studies focus on the esthetic benefits of lipolytic ultrasound, less attention has been given to the metabolic fate of liberated lipids and whether therapeutic ultrasound can influence systemic health. A literature search was conducted using PubMed to identify clinical trials and mechanistic studies on ultrasound-based fat reduction, with emphasis on peer-reviewed articles published within the past five years. Reported results show average waist circumference reductions of 0.5-3.12 inches and modest weight loss of 0.47-2.5 pounds following three treatment sessions. Existing literature suggests that lipid byproducts may enter systemic circulation, and adjunctive therapies such as lymphatic drainage and aerobic exercise may support their clearance or oxidation. However, studies directly investigating post-lipolytic metabolism are limited. This review synthesizes current findings and proposed mechanisms; and highlights the need for further investigation into the metabolic consequences of ultrasound-induced lipolysis.",

    "title": "The Metabolic Adaptation to Exercise Following Intensity-Specific Aerobic Training in Female Rats.",
    "abstract": "Limited research has examined the impact of training intensity on substrate utilization during acute exercise. Despite sex differences in the metabolic response to exercise, few studies have examined females. This study compared the utilization of substrate during acute exercise following 8 wk of low-intensity (LoT) and high-intensity (HiT) aerobic training (AT) in female rats. It was hypothesized that both training programs would result in increased fat oxidation during acute exercise, with HiT demonstrating a higher shift toward fat oxidation. Thirty-six female rodents were divided into four groups: sedentary control (Control), acute exercise only (AC), LoT, and HiT. The LoT and HiT groups performed progressive exercise up to an intensity of 21 and 36 m·min -1 , respectively. After training, the trained and AC groups performed an acute bout of 60-min exercise (30 m·min -1 ) and were sacrificed 30 min later. Levels of epinephrine and protein kinase A activity were significantly higher ( P < 0.05) in both the trained and control groups. Both LoT and HiT exhibited higher muscle glycogen content in comparison to AC ( P < 0.05), suggesting muscle glycogen sparing in the trained animals. Moreover, hepatic glycogen in the HiT animals was significantly higher than LoT, suggesting that hepatic glycogenolysis was reduced. An increase in HSL activation in the HiT indicates a shift toward fat utilization during exercise and a directed role of protein kinase A to a preferable activation and utilization of fat. These findings increase our understanding of various metabolic adaptations in response to different AT intensities in females.",

    "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with increased oxidative stress, which contributes to systemic dysfunction and respiratory muscle impairment. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of respiratory muscle training (RMT) on oxidative stress and antioxidant activity in diabetic rats induced by a high-fat diet and low-dose streptozotocin. Male Wistar rats (n = 30) were divided into four groups: sedentary-sham (Sed-Sham, n = 8), respiratory muscle trained-sham (RMT-Sham, n = 8), sedentary-DM (Sed-DM, n = 7), and respiratory muscle trained-DM (RMT-DM, n = 7). DM was induced using a high-energy diet followed by a low-dose streptozotocin injection. The RMT protocol consisted of 30 min/day, 5 days/week, for 6 weeks, whereas the sedentary animals did not exercise. Oxidative stress was assessed by measuring thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and dichlorofluorescein (DCF) levels, while antioxidant capacity was evaluated through superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and non-protein thiol (NPSH) levels in plasma and selected tissues. In DM rats, RMT significantly reduced TBARS levels in plasma and gastrocnemius muscle, indicating a decrease in lipid peroxidation. Furthermore, RMT partially restored antioxidant capacity, as evidenced by increased SOD activity in the lungs and elevated NPSH levels in the liver. In Sham rats, RMT also demonstrated beneficial effects, reducing TBARS levels in the gastrocnemius muscle and enhancing SOD activity in the kidneys. RMT attenuated oxidative stress in DM rats by reducing lipid peroxidation and enhancing antioxidant defenses. These findings suggest RMT as a potential non-pharmacological strategy to improve oxidative balance in rats with diabetes.",

This study validated measures from IB770 against the deuterium oxide dilution technique (D2O) and DXA and compared a four-compartment (4C) model using total body water (TBW) derived from IB770 compared with D2O. A total of 55 adult females (mean ± SD, age: 21.1 ± 2.6 years) completed IB770 and DXA scans and the D2O protocol. Lin's concordance correlation coefficients (CCCs), Bland-Altman analyses, and other equivalence tests evaluated agreement between IB770 and the criterion for measures of fat mass (FM), fat-free mass (FFM), and TBW individually and as part of 4C models. There was substantial agreement between IB770 and D2O for TBW (MD = Mean Difference) (MD = 0.34 L, CCC = 0.98) and between the IB770 and DXA for FM (MD = -0.22 kg, CCC = 0.99). IB770 overestimated FFM compared with DXA (MD = 3.15 kg, CCC = 0.91). Both 4C models had almost perfect agreement for FM (CCC = 0.99), FFM (CCC = 0.99), and body fat percentage (CCC = 0.99). IB770 is valid for assessing TBW and can be used within the context of a 4C model in females.",

    "title": "Modulating Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia Through Physical Activity-The Emerging Role of Myokines: A Narrative Review.",
    "abstract": "Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a multifactorial condition that is highly prevalent and affects aging males. It frequently results in lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and a reduced quality of life. While hormonal dysregulation and chronic inflammation have long been implicated in BPH pathogenesis, recent evidence highlights the role of physical activity in modulating prostate health. In this narrative review, evidence from quantitative studies examining the effect of exercise on BPH risk and symptom severity was first synthesized. Collectively, these studies suggest that regular physical activity is associated with a lower incidence and reduced progression of BPH. The potential mechanisms through which exercise may exert protective effects on the prostate were then explored. These include modulation of sympathetic nervous system activity, alterations in hormonal profiles (e.g., testosterone and insulin), suppression of chronic inflammation and oxidative stress, and the promotion of autophagy within prostatic tissue. Central to these mechanisms is the role of myokines-signaling molecules secreted by skeletal muscle during exercise. Key myokines, such as irisin, interleukin-6 (IL-6), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and myostatin, are reviewed in the context of prostate health. These molecules regulate inflammatory pathways, metabolic processes, and tissue remodeling. For instance, exercise-induced reductions in myostatin are linked to improved insulin sensitivity and decreased fat accumulation, while elevated irisin and BDNF levels may exert anti-inflammatory and metabolic benefits relevant to BPH pathophysiology. Although direct causal evidence linking myokines to BPH is still emerging, their biological plausibility and observed systemic effects suggest a promising avenue for non-pharmacological intervention. Future research should focus on identifying the specific myokines involved, elucidating their molecular mechanisms within the prostate, and evaluating their therapeutic potential in clinical trials.",

    "title": "Exercise-Induced Muscle-Fat Crosstalk: Molecular Mediators and Their Pharmacological Modulation for the Maintenance of Metabolic Flexibility in Aging.",
    "abstract": "Regular physical activity induces a dynamic crosstalk between skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, modulating the key molecular pathways that underlie metabolic flexibility, mitochondrial function, and inflammation. This review highlights the role of myokines and adipokines-particularly IL-6, irisin, leptin, and adiponectin-in orchestrating muscle-adipose tissue communication during exercise. Exercise stimulates AMPK, PGC-1α, and SIRT1 signaling, promoting mitochondrial biogenesis, fatty acid oxidation, and autophagy, while also regulating muscle hypertrophy through the PI3K/Akt/mTOR and Wnt/β-catenin pathways. Simultaneously, adipose-derived factors like leptin and adiponectin modulate skeletal muscle metabolism via JAK/STAT3 and AdipoR1-mediated AMPK activation. Additionally, emerging exercise mimetics such as the mitochondrial-derived peptide MOTS-c and myostatin inhibitors are highlighted for their roles in increasing muscle mass, the browning of white adipose tissue, and improving systemic metabolic function. The review also addresses the role of anti-inflammatory compounds, including omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and low-dose aspirin, in mitigating NF-κB and IL-6 signaling to protect mitochondrial health. The resulting metabolic flexibility, defined as the ability to efficiently switch between lipid and glucose oxidation, is enhanced through repeated exercise, counteracting age- and disease-related mitochondrial and functional decline. Together, these adaptations demonstrate the importance of inter-tissue signaling in maintaining energy homeostasis and preventing sarcopenia, obesity, and insulin resistance. Finally, here we propose a stratified treatment algorithm based on common age-related comorbidities, offering a framework for precision-based interventions that may offer a promising strategy to preserve metabolic plasticity and delay the age-associated decline in cardiometabolic health.",

    "title": "p38α MAPK Regulation of Energy Metabolism in Skeletal Muscle Offers a Therapeutic Path for Type 2 Diabetes.",
    "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes (T2D), a growing global health concern, is closely linked to obesity and sedentary behavior. Central to its development are insulin resistance and impaired glucose metabolism in peripheral tissues, particularly skeletal muscle, which plays a key role in energy expenditure, glucose uptake, and insulin sensitivity. Notably, increased accumulation of lipid metabolites in skeletal muscle is observed both in endurance exercise-associated with improved insulin sensitivity-and in high-fat diets that induce insulin resistance. The review examines the contrasting metabolic adaptations of skeletal muscle to these opposing conditions and highlights the key signaling molecules involved. The focus then shifts to the role of the stress kinase p38α mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in skeletal muscle adaptation to overnutrition and endurance exercise. p38α enhances mitochondrial oxidative capacity and regulates nutrient utilization, both critical for maintaining metabolic homeostasis. During exercise, it cooperates with AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) to boost glucose uptake and fatty acid oxidation, key mechanisms for improving insulin sensitivity. The co-activation of p38α and AMPK in skeletal muscle emerges as a promising therapeutic avenue to combat insulin resistance and T2D. The review explores strategies for selectively enhancing p38α activity in skeletal muscle. In conclusion, it advocates a comprehensive approach to T2D prevention and treatment, combining established caloric intake-reducing therapies, such as GLP-1 receptor agonists, with interventions aimed at increasing energy expenditure via activation of p38α and AMPK signaling pathways.",

In humans, these lifestyle interventions can also modulate autophagy and apoptosis in lymphocytes, especially natural killer (NK) cells, T cells, and B cells, which play an important role in fighting cancer and virus-infected cells. Fasting and exercise increase the concentration of autophagic monocytes, enhance killer T lymphocytes, strengthen the immune system, and delay cancer progression.

    "abstract": "Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is essential for thermoregulation and energy metabolism, converting fatty acids into thermal energy in response to cold exposure and dietary intake, thereby contributing to both cold-induced thermogenesis and diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT). Our previous research suggests that boysenberry anthocyanins (BoyACs) may activate BAT under cold conditions, and we hypothesized that BoyACs could also influence DIT through the activation of BAT. This pilot randomized, double-blind crossover trial aimed to evaluate the effects of daily intake of BoyACs on DIT in healthy adults (registration number: UMIN000047413). Twenty-two participants consumed either a boysenberry juice (BoyJ) beverage containing 61.0 mg of BoyACs or a placebo beverage daily for four weeks, with a four-week washout period separating the two interventions. Three participants withdrew during the trial, resulting in data from 19 participants being analyzed. Results showed no significant changes in DIT, defined as increase in postprandial energy expenditure, or skin temperature of BAT regions. However, a significant increase in postprandial fat oxidation was observed. No significant differences were observed in other outcomes. These results suggest that BoyJ intake does not significantly affect postprandial energy expenditure but may influence substrate utilization to promote fat oxidation. Further studies focusing on substrate utilization, particularly fat oxidation, as the primary outcome are necessary to confirm these results and fully understand the implications of BoyJ intake on energy metabolism.",

    "abstract": "Aging is associated with declines in muscle mass, strength, aerobic capacity, and metabolic health, accompanied by increased low-grade inflammation. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of 12 weeks of resistance training (RT) combined with minimal high-intensity interval training (HIIT), with or without polyphenol supplementation, on muscular, cardiovascular, metabolic, and inflammatory adaptations in healthy older adults. Forty-one men and women aged 55-70 years ingested either polyphenol supplementation or placebo for 30 days, then underwent 12 weeks of supervised RT combined with once-weekly HIIT, continuing polyphenol supplementation or placebo throughout. The training intervention increased whole-body and thigh lean mass, vastus lateralis cross-sectional area, type II fiber size, and muscle and functional strength (all p < 0.001). Maximal oxygen uptake significantly increased (p = 0.0001), accompanied by reductions in heart rate and plasma lactate during submaximal exercise, as well as increases in total blood volume and hemoglobin mass (p < 0.05). Training led to reductions in respiratory exchange ratio and plasma cortisol during exercise, which, together with decreased cholesterol levels and trends toward increased peak fat oxidation, may suggest enhanced substrate utilization. Polyphenols alone lowered cholesterol levels but had no other effects. Although no changes were observed in basal systemic or muscle inflammation, the exercise intervention attenuated the acute exercise-induced inflammatory responses of IL-10, IFN-γ, and TNF-α (p < 0.05). These results indicate that a combined RT and minimal HIIT program improves muscular, aerobic, and metabolic health, and may improve inflammatory regulation in aging adults.",

    "abstract": "Lipedema is a chronic, estrogen-sensitive adipose tissue disorder characterized by disproportionate subcutaneous fat accumulation, fibrosis, inflammation, and resistance to fat mobilization. Despite its high prevalence, lipedema remains poorly understood and frequently misdiagnosed. This narrative review proposes a novel pathophysiological model in which menopause acts as a critical turning point in the progression of lipedema, driven by estrogen receptor imbalance (ERβ predominance over ERα), intracrine estrogen excess, and adipose tissue dysfunction. We demonstrate how menopause amplifies adipose tissue dysfunction by suppressing ERα signaling; enhancing ERβ activity; and disrupting mitochondrial function, insulin sensitivity, and lipid oxidation. Concurrently, the upregulation of aromatase and 17β-HSD1, combined with the suppression of 17β-HSD2, sustains localized estradiol excess, perpetuating inflammation, fibrosis, and immune dysregulation. The molecular signature observed in lipedema closely mirrors that of other estrogen-driven gynecological disorders, such as endometriosis, adenomyosis, and uterine fibroids. Understanding these molecular mechanisms highlights the pivotal role of menopause as a catalyst for disease progression and provides a rationale for targeted therapeutic strategies, including hormonal modulation and metabolic interventions. This review reframes lipedema as an estrogen receptor-driven gynecological disorder, offering a new perspective to improve clinical recognition, diagnosis, and management of this neglected condition.",

    "title": "Successfully Reducing Sitting Time Can Improve Metabolic Flexibility.",
    "abstract": "Impaired metabolic flexibility (MetFlex; the ability to regulate substrate oxidation) and sedentary behavior are both linked to cardiometabolic diseases, but the relationship between the two is not fully elucidated. This study investigated the effects of reduced sedentary time on MetFlex. Sixty-four sedentary adults with metabolic syndrome were randomized into intervention (INT, n = 33) and control (CON, n = 31) groups. INT aimed to reduce sedentary time by 1 h/day by increasing standing and non-exercise physical activity (PA) for 6 months, with continuous accelerometry. Substrate oxidation and MetFlex [ΔRER (respiratory exchange ratio)] from fasting to hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp and low- to maximal-intensity exercise were assessed with indirect calorimetry. Intervention effects between INT and CON were analyzed with mixed models, and secondary analyses examined the effects based on accelerometer-derived behavior changes. INT reduced sedentary time by 41 min/day. Neither insulin- nor exercise-stimulated MetFlex changed in INT or CON, but carbohydrate oxidation during maximal exercise changed differently, favoring INT [INT +2.6 (95% CI: -6.1, 0.8), CON -1.4 (-2.1, 4.9) mg/kg/min; group * time p = 0.03]. In secondary analyses, those who successfully reduced sedentary time by at least 30 min/day (n = 34) improved insulin-stimulated MetFlex and low-intensity exercise fat oxidation compared to the continuously sedentary (n = 30) [ΔRER +0.03 (-0.01, 0.07) vs. -0.02 (-0.06, 0.03); and FATox +0.2 (-0.3, 0.7) vs. -0.4 (-1.0, 1.0) mg/kg/min, group * time p < 0.05]. Changes in insulin-stimulated MetFlex correlated with changes in standing and insulin sensitivity. Thus, successfully reducing daily sitting by at least half an hour can improve MetFlex, with parallel insulin sensitivity enhancements, and aid in cardiometabolic disease prevention in risk populations.

    "abstract": "Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) dysfunction contributes to vascular impairment in obesity, primarily through altered lipid accumulation, inflammatory cytokine imbalance, and disrupted endothelial signaling. This study aimed to investigate whether aerobic exercise can ameliorate PVAT-induced vascular dysfunction in mice with obesity induced by a high-fat diet. Male C57BL/6J mice were fed either a chow or a high-fat diet for 12 weeks, followed by 8 weeks of aerobic treadmill training or sedentary control. Body weight, PVAT morphology, and levels of inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 1β, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, and intercellular adhesion molecule 1), adipokines (leptin and adiponectin), and phosphorylation of endothelial signaling proteins (Akt, AMP-activated protein kinase [AMPK], and endothelial nitric oxide synthase [eNOS]) were evaluated in the thoracic aorta and PVAT. Endothelium-dependent relaxation (EDR) was assessed using acetylcholine-induced vasodilation in aortic rings with or without PVAT. High-fat diet-induced obesity led to increased adipocyte size in PVAT, while it also impaired vascular relaxation, elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines, and reduced phosphorylation of Akt, AMPK, and eNOS in both PVAT and the aorta. Aerobic exercise training significantly reduced PVAT adipocyte size, restored EDR, suppressed inflammatory cytokine levels, increased adiponectin expression, and promoted phosphorylation of vascular signaling molecules in both PVAT and the aorta. Aerobic exercise training restores PVAT homeostasis and endothelial function in obese mice by modulating inflammation, adipokines, and vascular signaling. These findings suggest aerobic exercise as a nonpharmacological approach to improve vascular function in obesity by targeting PVAT dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "Oxamate is a well-known inhibitor of glycolysis. However, its broad inhibitory effects on whole-body energy metabolism in vivo have not been identified. Therefore, we aimed to investigate its effects on wholebody energy metabolism in mice. Ten-week-old male ICR mice were used in this study. The resting metabolic rate was measured for 3 h immediately after the intraperitoneal injection of oxamate (750 mg/kg) using a metabolic chamber system. In addition, resting blood glucose and lactate concentrations were measured. Next, the metabolism during exercise (10-25 m/min) was measured for 30 min immediately after oxamate injection using a metabolic treadmill chamber system. Post-exercise blood lactate concentrations were measured immediately after exercise sessions. The resting respiratory exchange rate remained unchanged, but fat and carbohydrate oxidation and energy expenditure (p = 0.003, 0.049, and 0.002, respectively) were significantly suppressed following oxamate injection. While the resting blood glucose levels were significantly reduced (p = 0.002), the lactate levels were significantly elevated (p = 0.005). The respiratory exchange rate during exercise significantly increased by oxamate injection (p = 0.02). Although fat oxidation during exercise significantly reduced (p = 0.009), carbohydrate oxidation remained unchanged. Consequently, energy expenditure during exercise was significantly reduced (p = 0.024) and post-exercise blood lactate levels were significantly elevated (p = 0.005) by oxamate injection. Oxamate suppressed whole-body energy metabolism by inhibiting fat oxidation and altering lactate dynamics in vivo. These results provide novel insights into the systemic metabolic effects of oxamate and highlight the need for further investigation of its impact under different physiological conditions.",

    "abstract": "Established guidelines recommend carbohydrate-rich diets to optimize performance in endurance sports. However, alternative dietary strategies, such as the low-arbohydrate and high-fat (LCHF) diet, have gained increasing attention due to their potential to influence metabolic flexibility and endurance performance outcomes. In this study, we aim to investigate the combined effects of a LCHF diet, along with low glycemic index (LOW-GI) and high glycemic index (HIGH-GI) diets, in conjunction with regular endurance exercise, on the metabolomic profiles of recreational runners. The classification into LOW-GI and HIGH-GI groups is based on the premise that metabolic regulation, particularly insulin response and glucose metabolism, differs significantly between the consumption of high-glycemic and low-glycemic foods. The participants ( The LCHF diet had a considerable impact on plasma lipids, whereas the respective effects in the LOW-GI and HIGH-GI groups were less pronounced. Specifically, 179 up- or down-regulated metabolites were identified in the LCHF group, 111 in the LOW-GI group, and 139 in the HIGH-GI group. Phospholipids and sphingolipids were found to be the most prominent metabolites in the samples. Furthermore, the regulation of glycerolipids, carnitine, amino acids, and carbon acids exhibited differential patterns across the groups. There is evidence to suggest that the LCHF diet enhances fat metabolism, as indicated by increased levels of carnitine and ketone bodies, as well as a downregulation of amino acids. Conversely, the presence of specific carbon acids might diminish carbohydrate metabolism and impair endurance performance. In contrast, the LOW-GI group may have demonstrated augmented metabolic flexibility due to the upregulations of both carnitines and carbon acids in the samples. The elevated glycerolipids content in the HIGH-GI group suggests a potential reduction in fatty acid oxidation due to hyperinsulinemia.",

Herein, we evaluate the effects of TRF on common bile duct ligation (BDL)-induced cirrhotic rats. A 14-day TRF treatment was conducted from the 15th to 28th day post BDL operation. Then the body weight, muscular change, hemodynamics, biochemistry data, hepatic and muscular histology and protein expressions of various molecules were examined in BDL rats. On the other hand, the effects of TRF treatment on the portal-systemic collaterals, motor activities, and muscular strength and endurance were measured. TRF treatment significantly decreased body weight without adverse effects in BDL rats. Meanwhile, TRF treatment reduced cardiac index and portal venous flow, attenuated hepatic inflammation and decreased insulin resistance, reduced oxidized low-density lipoprotein and decreased intrahepatic fat accumulation. The circumference of gastrocnemius muscle did not change despite a significant body weight reduction after TRF. Furthermore, rats' endurance of exercise enhanced after TRF. A 14-day TRF treatment neither ameliorated liver fibrosis nor improved motor activities of BDL rats. In addition, the severity of portal-systemic shunts was not influenced by TRF. In BDL-induced cirrhotic rats, a 14-day TRF treatment alters hemodynamics, attenuates hepatic inflammation and improves metabolic derangement. Additionally, TRF treatment increases muscular endurance without influencing the circumference of gastrocnemius muscle.

    "title": "Oral apigenin prevents obesity-related muscular atrophy, but not obesity itself, in middle-aged rats fed a high-calorie diet.",
    "abstract": "Obesity constitutes a growing global health concern, affecting individuals during the aging process. Flavonoids that increase tissue NAD+ levels, such as apigenin (Api), are proposed for the treatment of obesity and age-related diseases. Thus, this study aimed to provide initial preclinical evidence of Api in this setting using middle-aged rats induced to obesity by a high-calorie diet (HCD). Forty-seven 15-month-old male Wistar rats were assigned to five groups: standard diet (SD) or HCD, each with (Api at 50 mg/kg) or without treatment (vehicle), plus vehicle control group. Obesity induction and therapeutic intervention were conducted concurrently for 88 days. Biometric, cardiac, adiposity, muscular, and blood biochemical parameters were analyzed. Eighty-eight days post HCD rats had hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, increased visceral and subcutaneous fat, and heart hypertrophy, indicating obesity and related disorders (p < 0.05 for all). The gastrocnemius of these rats exhibits reduced mass, smaller myocytes, and fibrosis (p < 0.05), indicating sarcopenia, likely caused or worsened by obesity. In parallel, preemptive Api treatment failed to prevent obesity and did not affect key adipose tissue browning genes, cardiac oxidative stress markers, or sirtuin and CD38 levels. However, it mitigated muscle loss and hypotrophy, in addition to elevating p70S6K levels in HCD-fed rats (p < 0.05 for both). These preclinical results suggest that although Api may not prevent some HCD-induced disturbances, it may attenuate age- and obesity-related atrophy via p70S6K anabolic signaling in middle-aged rats. To support clinical translation, particularly in sarcopenia subtypes, further mechanistic and therapeutic investigations on Api are required to elucidate its effects on skeletal muscle.",

    "abstract": "Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare but debilitating condition that causes exercise intolerance and ultimately death. Skeletal muscle derangements contribute to depressed exercise capacity in PAH, but the mechanisms underlying muscle dysfunction, including the changes in muscle biology based on fiber type, are understudied. We evaluated exercise capacity, muscle histopathology, mitochondrial density, mitochondrial proteomics, and metabolomics/lipidomics of quadriceps (predominately fast fibers) and soleus (predominately slow fibers) muscles in the monocrotaline (MCT) rat model of PAH. MCT rats exhibited impaired exercise capacity. Surprisingly, there were divergent atrophic and metabolic remodeling in the quadriceps and soleus muscles of MCT rats. In the quadriceps, there was a mild atrophic response only in type II fibers. In contrast, both type I and II fibers atrophied in the soleus. Both muscles exhibited fibrotic infiltration, but mitochondrial density was reduced in the quadriceps only. Mitochondrial proteomics and tissue metabolomics/lipidomics profiling demonstrated that the 2 muscles exhibited distinct responses, as the quadriceps had impairments in oxidative phosphorylation/fat metabolism and storage of triacylglycerides. However, the soleus showed signs of proteasome deficiencies and alterations in phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylethanolamine homeostasis. Finally, profiling of metabolites/lipids in the serum identified potential novel biomarkers of exercise intolerance in PAH, including the dimethylarginine pathway, cysteine, and triacylglycerides. Our data suggest differential cachectic and metabolic responses occur in PAH-induced myopathy. We nominate mitochondrial biogenesis and proteasome activation as potential druggable targets for PAH myopathy.",

    "abstract": "Diets high in simple carbohydrates and saturated fats, commonly consumed in Westernized countries, have been linked to a greater predisposition to metabolic disorders, which are partly attributed to oxidative stress. This study aimed to investigate the impact of an obesogenic diet consumed during the pregnancy and lactation periods on hepatic metabolism and REDOX balance in rats. Sixteen pregnant Wistar rats were divided into two groups: control (CD), which received a vivarium diet, and obesogenic (OD), which received an obesogenic diet (high-fat diet plus condensed milk), from early pregnancy to late lactation. Thirty-six hours after weaning, the rats were euthanized, and blood, adipose tissue, and liver samples were collected for analysis. These results demonstrate that exposure to an obesogenic diet during pregnancy and lactation in rats leads to adverse changes in hepatic metabolic, inflammatory, and REDOX balance. This experimental animal model serves as a valuable tool for investigating the mechanisms of metabolic dysfunction associated with diets that mimic human eating habits. However, it is essential to note that these findings pertain to an experimental model and therefore require validation in clinical studies to confirm their relevance and applicability in human health. The consumption of an obesogenic diet during pregnancy and lactation in rats induces adverse alterations in hepatic metabolic, inflammatory, and redox homeostasis. This animal model helps investigate the mechanisms of metabolic dysfunctions associated with human dietary habits. However, these findings still need to be confirmed in clinical studies to verify their relevance in humans.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is associated with impaired physical fitness, including physical functional performance and cardiorespiratory fitness, which affect health-related quality of life and mortality. We aimed to investigate the efficacy of a moderate-to-vigorous intensity exercise program and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist treatment alone or in combination during weight maintenance for physical fitness. This is secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial involving 193 adults with obesity (age 18-65 years, body mass index 32-43 kg/m Participants randomized to exercise performed a median 2.65 session/week (116 min/week at 79% of maximum heart rate) with no significant difference between those who received placebo or liraglutide. Compared with liraglutide alone, the combined treatment decreased time to complete a stair climb test by 1.2 s [95% confidence interval 0.6-1.9] (corresponding to 8.6%) and improved peak oxygen consumption by 3.0 mL/min/kg fat-free mass [95% confidence interval 0.5-5.5]. Exercise alone led to similar benefits, whereas liraglutide alone did not improve physical fitness. Compared with placebo (- 7.8%), relative muscle strength (strength normalized to body weight) was higher with exercise (- 0.4%), liraglutide (+ 1.0%), and the combined treatment (+ 3.3%) because of lower weight and preserved absolute strength. Structured exercise combined with glucagon-like peptide-1-based obesity pharmacotherapy led to clinically meaningful improvements in physical functional performance and cardiorespiratory fitness, in contrast to pharmacotherapy alone.

Here, a personalised version of the SLIMMER CLI was evaluated for effects on lifestyle advice adherence as primary outcome and effects on weight loss, metabolism and inflammation as secondary outcomes. In this cluster-allocated controlled open-label parallel intervention study with 4 different health care sites per cluster, 61 participants in the personalised and 60 participants in the regular SLIMMER CLI (control) were included. Adults at risk for cardiometabolic disease were followed for 6 months. Adherence to lifestyle advice, Dutch Healthy Diet Index (DHDI), self-efficacy, lifestyle maintenance and quality of life (QoL) was assessed by questionnaires. Body composition and blood samples were measured at baseline and end of study. At 6 months the dropout rate was lower in the intervention group (11%) than in the control group (23%, p < 0.001). Self-reported adherence to lifestyle advice and DHDI improved in both groups at 3 and 6 months, whereas self-efficacy and lifestyle maintenance did not change as a result of the intervention. At 6 months self-reported adherence to physical activity guidelines and QoL was higher in favour of control. At 6 months, body weight (-4.5 kg, p = 0.006), BMI (-1.5 kg/m",

    "title": "Optimizing GLP-1 therapies for obesity and diabetes management.",
    "abstract": "Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) therapies are highly effective for weight loss and metabolic improvement in obesity and type 2 diabetes management. However, their use poses clinical challenges, including loss of lean muscle mass and gastrointestinal side effects, both of which may affect adherence and long-term outcomes. This commentary synthesizes current evidence and expert perspectives, drawing on presentations from the 42nd International Symposium on Diabetes and Nutrition by the Diabetes and Nutrition Study Group, to develop practical recommendations for integrating nutrition and physical activity with GLP-1 therapies for obesity and diabetes management. We summarize consensus recommendations from a global working group, organized into seven thematic modules, to guide alignment of GLP-1 therapies with dietary and lifestyle interventions across the key stages of the weight management journey. Evidence from several clinical trials demonstrate that the combination of GLP-1 therapies with structured dietary and exercise interventions results in additive weight loss effects compared with either strategy alone. Strategies to preserve lean mass with GLP-1 therapies include achieving protein intakes >1.2 g/kg/day, evenly distributed across meals, combined with aerobic activity and structured resistance training. Specific recommendations are provided to minimize nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation associated with GLP-1 therapies, as well as to prevent and manage complications such as, cholelithiasis and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Future research priorities include examining the impact of GLP-1 therapies on dietary habits and physical activity levels, improving muscle health assessment, and testing pharmacologic adjuncts to limit lean mass loss. Maximizing the benefits of GLP-1 therapies require a multidisciplinary approach that integrates evidence-based nutrition, physical activity, and proactive management of gastrointestinal side effects. Such an approach can enhance adherence, preserve functional capacity, and sustain the long-term benefits of these therapies.",

    "title": "Development, Challenges, and Evolution of the Log2Lose Intervention for Weight Management: Randomized Controlled Digital Health Trial.",
    "abstract": "Long-term adherence to weight loss behaviors is challenging, as most individuals who achieve significant weight loss regain 1-2 kg per year. Financial incentives can reinforce weight-loss initiation and maintenance behaviors, but optimal strategies remain unclear. This paper describes the design, technical architecture, and operational workflow of Log2Lose, a 5-year, multisite randomized controlled trial testing different financial incentive strategies to promote weight loss and maintenance. We detail the platform's integration with external devices, automated data collection, and adaptations to maintain intervention fidelity in the context of evolving technology and regulatory requirements. The Log2Lose platform collects daily weight and dietary data from cellular scales and fitness tracking applications, calculates weekly incentive eligibility, and sends automated feedback and motivational text messages. We summarize the technical adaptations, message delivery performance, data completeness, and the balance between automation and manual support required to ensure data integrity. By the end of the study, 706 participants recorded 181,285 weights and 114,144 daily calorie entries. The platform sent 126,283 text messages and calculated 35,187 incentive payments, with 99.4% (34,976/35,187) processed automatically. Adaptations addressed device integration changes, application programming interface discontinuations, and new text messaging regulations. Despite automation, ongoing technical support was essential for resolving delivery errors, device issues, and data anomalies. Log2Lose demonstrated that large-scale, fully remote weight loss interventions can be implemented using consumer technology paired with a robust, adaptable platform. Success depended on flexible software design, continuous monitoring, and responsive technical support to navigate regulatory and technological changes. Log2Lose offers a practical model for processing remotely collected longitudinal dietary and weight data, providing valuable guidance for researchers, health care providers, and employers developing similar digital health interventions.

    "abstract": "Obesity has become a global health crisis and is in urgent need of effective, sustainable interventions. Although conventional approaches such as dietary modification and aerobic exercise demonstrate efficacy, long-term maintenance of weight loss is still challenging. Dance movement therapy (DMT) is emerging as a promising intervention, combining physical activity with psychological and social engagement to potentially enhance compliance and holistic health outcomes. However, existing studies on DMT for weight management are limited, with inconsistent results. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies comparing DMT and standard lifestyle interventions (e.g., diet/exercise counseling) in overweight or obese adults will be included. Literature searches will be conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang, and Cochrane Library. Two reviewers independently perform the processes of literature retrieval, screening, data extraction, and assessment of risk of bias. Risk of bias in included studies is evaluated using the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool (ROB 2) for RCTs and the Risk Of Bias In Non-randomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-1) for non-RCTs. Review Manager (RevMan) was used for data pooling. Subgroup analysis, meta-regression, trial sequential analysis (TSA), and sensitivity analysis are conducted. Ethical approval is not required because this study is a secondary analysis of existing data. We will disseminate the findings through peer-reviewed publications. PROSPERO CRD42024614884 STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY: • This systematic review and meta-analysis employs a rigorous methodology and strict adherence to inclusion criteria. • The use of ROB 2 and ROBINS-1 ensures a robust evaluation of study quality. • The certainty of evidence may be limited by inconsistent study quality and small sample sizes of enrolled trials.",

    "abstract": "Over 70% of adults in the United States are overweight or obese. Weight loss is often recommended to improve overall health and risk of disease. However, weight regain is common and diminishes initial health improvements. Mindfulness-based interventions are a novel approach to mitigating weight regain. In this study, we aimed to investigate the feasibility of a mindfulness intervention to prevent weight regain in weight-reduced adults. Women (age: 40.2±10.8; BMI: 28.3±4.3) who achieved 7% reduction in body mass within the previous 2 months were enrolled in an 8-week mindfulness intervention (N=10). Body mass, body composition, and appetite traits (via the Three-Factor Eating Inventory) were assessed at baseline and 8-weeks. Satisfaction was assessed at the conclusion of the intervention. Retention, adherence, and satisfaction with content, meetings, and weight loss maintenance (measured via Likert Scale) were favorable (70% retention; 89.3±13.4% attendance; satisfaction: 9.25±1.5; 9.25±1.5; 9.5±1, respectively). Additionally, weight loss was maintained following the 8-week mindfulness intervention (-0.04 ± 3.3% weight change). Lastly, dietary restraint (pre: 11.7±4.1; post: 12.7±4.5), disinhibition (pre: 6.3±4.4; post: 6.6±4.8), and hedonic hunger (pre: 3.7±2.6; post: 2.9±3.8) were stable. Mindfulness interventions are feasible and potentially efficacious approaches for short-term weight loss maintenance. Future trials that include matched controls and longer-term follow-up are needed.",

    "abstract": "Obesity has emerged as a significant global public health challenge. Sleeve gastrectomy (SG), currently the most widely performed bariatric procedure worldwide, has demonstrated substantial efficacy in achieving significant weight loss and improving metabolic health. However, notable postoperative complications-particularly malnutrition and weight regain-require heightened clinical attention and the implementation of effective long-term management strategies. These adverse outcomes result from a variety of factors, including anatomical changes that trigger complex hormonal, metabolic, and immune adaptations. These issues are often compounded by suboptimal lifestyle behaviors and poor adherence to postoperative recommendations. Emerging evidence highlights that sustained dietary counseling provides significant long-term benefits for the majority of patients undergoing SG. Therefore, this review aimed to synthesize the current understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms that drive digestive adaptations, malnutrition, and weight regain following SG. Further, it evaluates the efficacy, feasibility, and tolerability of targeted dietary management strategies aimed at mitigating these complications.",

    "abstract": "The hypothesis that dietary restrictions may trigger the development of binge eating episodes has existed for some time; however, it is unclear whether this association is due to the individual's developmental environment. To identify, through a scoping review, the leading scientific findings on this topic and outline the existing evidence regarding the relationship between dietary restriction and the development or aggravation of compulsion. This scoping review was conducted following the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for scoping reviews through a systematic literature search to identify eligible articles in the PubMed, Scopus, Lilacs, and Web of Science databases, published between 1980 and June 2024, using the (P-, C-, C-) criteria. The study adhered to the guidelines proposed by the \"Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews.\" The screening process resulted in the inclusion of 80 articles, 76 of which were analyzed in detail, and were predominantly observational studies conducted in the United States focusing on adult women. A total of 53 (69.74%) studies found evidence that restrictive diets increase binge eating, especially under conditions of high impulsivity and negative emotions, although 23 (30.26%) studies reported opposite results. Among the rigid diets analyzed, nutrient-control approaches such as low-carb diets and severe calorie restrictions were frequently associated with loss of eating control, whereas flexible approaches showed less adverse impact and better emotional and weight management outcomes. This review highlights that restrictive diets are associated with increased binge eating when combined with negative emotional factors. However, it remains unclear whether dietary restriction alone in healthy individuals is directly associated with binge eating.",

    "abstract": "Although behavioral weight-loss programs are efficacious for achieving clinically significant weight loss, adherence to such programs is variable. Positive reinforcement through small financial incentives has shown promise for increasing adherence to behaviors and clinical outcomes in some domains. Yet, for weight management, it is unknown whether to incent the behavior (calorie logging), the outcome (weight loss), or both. We report the rationale and design for a two-site clinical trial employing a three-phase, 2 × 2 factorial design to evaluate the impact of financial incentives for calorie logging and/or weekly weight loss. Phase I involved a 26-week incentivized weight-loss period with virtual group sessions every two weeks; Phase II involved a 26-week incentivized weight-loss maintenance period with three monthly group sessions and five individual counseling telephone calls; and Phase III involved a 26-week weight-loss maintenance period without incentives with three bimonthly calls. Participants were asked to record their caloric intake on a smartphone application and to weigh themselves regularly on a cellular scale. These data were processed each week to determine if participants qualified for a financial incentive ranging from $0 to $10. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants achieving clinically significant weight loss of at least 5 % at 26 weeks. Secondary outcomes were the same proportions measured at 52 and 78 weeks, and blood pressure and cardiovascular medication use at 78 weeks. Motivation for weight loss will be examined as a potential mediator of the treatment effect. Intervention cost and cost-effectiveness will be calculated to inform implementation.

    "title": "Lifestyle Medicine for Obesity in the Era of Highly Effective Anti-Obesity Treatment.",
    "abstract": "Despite recent advances in the treatment of obesity, lifestyle medicine remains foundational to the treatment of individuals with obesity, regardless of the modality chosen by the patient with the guidance of the clinician they are working with, including in conjunction with, as appropriate, anti-obesity medications and metabolic surgery. Lifestyle medicine involves the use of diet, exercise, sleep, stress, and other lifestyle modalities in the treatment of disease. Clinicians and health systems should, after a patient-centered discussion with the patient, do their best to ensure access to lifestyle treatments. Gold standard guidelines recommend intensive, multicomponent lifestyle change programs for obesity treatments with evidence-based diet and exercise counseling and established, theoretically driven behavior change components. Clinicians treating obesity should be aware of their own biases, make efforts to reduce stigmatizing experiences in their practice, and address weight stigma in their treatment plans as needed. A variety of dietary patterns can be used to support patients with obesity, and clinicians should make evidence-based but patient-centered recommendations that aim to maximize adherence. Diet and exercise can play an important role in reducing the side effects of treatment and optimizing outcomes in weight loss, attenuating the effects of metabolic adaptation, and weight maintenance. Exercise should be increased gradually to reduce injury with a goal of 200-300 min (approximately 3.3-5 h) of moderate to vigorous intensity exercise per week to maximize weight maintenance effects with exercise prescriptions customized to patients risks. A variety of practice models can be leveraged along with the use of an interdisciplinary team to provide lifestyle medicine care for those with obesity.",

    "title": "Nutritional priorities to support GLP-1 therapy for obesity: A joint advisory from the American College of Lifestyle Medicine, the American Society for Nutrition, the Obesity Medicine Association, and the Obesity Society.",
    "abstract": "Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists and combination medications (GLP-1s) are shifting the treatment landscape for obesity. However, real-world challenges and limited clinician and public knowledge on nutritional and lifestyle interventions can limit GLP-1 efficacy, equitable results, and cost-effectiveness. We aimed to identify pragmatic priorities for nutrition and other lifestyle interventions relevant to GLP-1 treatment of obesity for the practicing clinician. An expert group comprising multiple clinical and research disciplines appraised the scientific literature, informed by expert knowledge and clinical experience, to identify and summarize relevant topics, priorities, and emerging directions. GLP-1s reduce body weight by 5-18 % in trials, with modestly lower effects in real-world analyses, with multiple demonstrated clinical benefits. Challenges include side effects, especially gastrointestinal; nutritional deficiencies due to calorie reduction; muscle and bone loss; low long-term adherence with subsequent weight regain; and high costs with resulting low cost-effectiveness. Numerous practice guidelines recommend multicomponent, evidence-based nutritional and behavioral therapy for adults with obesity, but use of such therapies with GLP-1s is not widespread. Priorities to address this include: (a) patient-centered initiation of GLP-1s, including goals for weight reduction and health; (b) baseline screening, including usual dietary habits, emotional triggers, disordered eating, and relevant medical conditions; (c) comprehensive exam including muscle strength, function, and body composition assessment; (d) social determinants of health screening; (e) and lifestyle assessment including aerobic activity, strength training, sleep, mental stress, substance use, and social connections. During GLP-1 use, nutritional and medical management of gastrointestinal side effects is critical, as is navigating altered dietary preferences and intakes, preventing nutrient deficiencies, preserving muscle and bone mass through resistance training and appropriate diet; and complementary lifestyle interventions. Supportive strategies include group-based visits, registered dietitian nutritionist counseling, telehealth and digital platforms, and Food is Medicine interventions. Drug access, food and nutrition insecurity, and nutrition and culinary knowledge influence equitable obesity management with GLP-1s. Emerging areas for more study include dietary modulation of endogenous GLP-1, strategies to improve compliance, nutritional priorities for weight maintenance post-cessation, combination or staged intensive lifestyle management, and diagnostic criteria for clinical obesity. Evidence-based nutritional and lifestyle strategies play a pivotal role to address key challenges around GLP-1 treatment of obesity, making clinicians more effective in advancing their patients' health.",

    "abstract": "More than 40% of adults in the United States have obesity, which is an independent risk factor for cardiometabolic dysfunction and several chronic diseases, including atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Interventions for obesity include lifestyle modification, pharmacotherapy, and metabolic surgery. Lifestyle interventions have minimal side effects and are the most economical, yet long-term adherence is poor. Challenges for long-term adherence are related, in part, to metabolic adaptations that occur during weight loss that affect appetite and energy expenditure. However, a lifestyle intervention that involves higher intakes of protein and fiber and increased participation in exercise may help to blunt the increases in hunger and cravings that occur with weight loss while increasing energy expenditure, thus assisting with both weight loss and weight loss maintenance. These changes also promote improved cardiometabolic health, independent of weight loss. This narrative review summarizes the evidence for the roles of increasing protein, fiber, and exercise for weight management and improving the cardiometabolic risk factor profile.",

    "abstract": "Research shows that the average person has a slightly addictive relationship with food, manifesting two or more symptoms of food addiction, and more than one in eight people have clinically diagnosable food addiction. Meanwhile, obesity and food addiction share some neurological mechanisms and are correlated in the general population. Could an abstinence-based approach to food addiction recovery be a viable long-term weight loss or weight maintenance strategy? The current study presents six-year retrospective follow-up data from a cohort of participants who started an abstinence-based food addiction recovery program for weight loss in October of 2017. Survey responses from 267 participants were analyzed and compared to baseline self-reported data from six years prior. At six years, 71.8% of participants were maintaining greater than 5% weight loss. There was a statistically significant association between sustained weight loss and both current program membership (p<0.001) and degree of adherence to the abstinence-based food plan (p<0.001). Adherence was associated with weight loss outcomes in a dose-response manner. The average sustained weight loss for current members who followed the program was 13.9%. In spite of the methodological challenges with this type of study, the results do suggest the long-term efficacy of a food addiction recovery approach to weight loss. They also help validate the notion that food addiction may be a significant contributor to the multi-factorial etiology of obesity and indicate the need for further research into the viability of abstinence-based food plans as tools for weight management.",

    "abstract": "Nonnutritive sweeteners were introduced on the market over a century ago to displace the calories of added sugars in foods and beverages and, therefore, facilitate weight loss. In spite of their widespread use, obesity has reached epidemic proportions. The present paper addresses this apparent paradox. Low- or no-energy sweeteners (LNES) are a small group of widely different substances that can be used to modify one single aspect of energy intake, i.e., consumption of added sugars. Their potential benefits for weight management can be predicted by energy balance equations. Decades of research confirm that LNES affect weight via a purely nutritional mechanism, in proportion of their actual displacement of sugar energy. LNES allow a substantial decrease in energy density of beverages (as opposed to solid foods) and can be maximally effective in consumers of sugar-containing drinks. Their average effect is robust but modest (1-2-kg weight loss) compared to comprehensive weight-loss programs (±5 kg), medication, or surgery (+10% of initial weight). Other benefits of LNES include sensory-specific satiety for sweet foods, improved diet adherence, and facilitation of weight-loss maintenance. Whether these effects are considered minor or major benefits in the present obesogenic context is a matter of individual definition.",

In this single-arm pilot study, 20 participants with overweight/obesity and complicated type 2 diabetes were recruited from the diabetes clinics at Hvidovre Hospital and Steno Diabetes Center Copenhagen in the Greater Copenhagen area, Denmark. Participants followed 8 weeks of strict 10-hour TRE, followed by a 4-week TRE period with individual adjustments and support options. Nineteen participants completed the intervention. Median (quartile 1-quartile 3) adherence to the eating window across all 12 weeks was 94% (86-98). Mean (95% confidence interval) reductions in body weight of -2.0 kg (-2.9 to -1.1) and hemoglobin A1c of -0.4% (-0.6 to -0.1) were observed. Participants expressed that the individualized options added flexibility to the eating concept, enabled the maintenance of social life, and eased challenging times with TRE. Twelve weeks of TRE was feasible. Individualized adjustments and support may have the potential to facilitate the maintenance of long-term TRE.",

    "abstract": "Bariatric surgery (BS) is an effective treatment for severe obesity, yet weight regain (WR) affects a significant proportion of patients in the long term. The lack of useful and standardized tools makes the follow-up of these patients more difficult. The Eating Behavior after Bariatric Surgery (EBBS) questionnaire was designed to assess adherence to post-surgical lifestyle recommendations, which may predict successful weight maintenance. This study aimed to adapt the EBBS for Spanish-speaking patients and evaluate its utility in assessing adherence to long-term lifestyle changes and its association with weight outcomes. A total of 100 patients who underwent a sleeve gastrectomy (mean follow-up 90.4 ± 46 months) were included. The EBBS was administered to evaluate food, drink, behavior, and lifestyle domains. Significant weight regain was observed in 70% of participants, and emotional eating (65%) and depression (53%) were common. The EBBS demonstrated good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.662). Higher total EBBS scores were significantly associated with greater excess weight loss (EWL), particularly for patients maintaining over 50% EWL (p = 0.04). Logistic regression revealed that EBBS scores > 13.5 predicted EWL > 50% (OR = 17.8, p = 0.010), underscoring the value of this tool in identifying patients at risk for WR. The Spanish version of the EBBS is a reliable tool for assessing post-BS diet and lifestyle patterns and predicting long-term weight outcomes. Tailored interventions based on EBBS results may improve adherence to dietary and lifestyle recommendations, reducing the risk of WR.",

    "abstract": "There are large individual differences in weight loss and maintenance. Metabolic testing can provide phenotypical information that can be used to personalize treatment so that people remain in negative energy balance during weight loss and remain in energy balance during maintenance. Behavioral testing can assess the reinforcing value and change in the temporal window related to the personalized diet and exercise program to motivate people to maintain engagement in healthier eating and activity programs. Provide an expository overview of how metabolic testing can be used to personalize weight control. Ideas about incorporating behavioral economic concepts are also included. A broad overview of how resting metabolic rate, thermic effect of food and respiratory quotient can be used to improve weight control. Also discussed are behavioral economic principles that can maximize adherence to diet and activity protocols. Research suggests that measuring metabolic rate can be used to set calorie goals for weight loss and maintenance, thermic effect of food to increase energy expenditure, and respiratory quotient to guide macronutrient composition of the diet and maximize fat loss. Developing programs that foster a strong motivation to eat healthier and be active can maximize treatment success. Incorporating metabolic measures can personalize behavioral weight loss programs, and the use of behavioral economic principles can increase the probability of adherence and long-term success in weight control.",

Understanding the patterns, barriers, and facilitators of dietary interventions is crucial for developing effective weight management protocols. This research aims to assess dietary modification interventions among weight loss subjects in Tamilnadu, South India. Specific objectives included evaluating various weight loss interventions, analyzing dietary patterns adopted by subjects, and examining characteristics, barriers, and facilitators associated with specific dietary modification approaches. Methodology A cross-sectional study was conducted among 432 participants from Tamilnadu, South India. The research employed a comprehensive data collection approach, gathering information on demographic characteristics, anthropometric measurements, dietary modification patterns, and intervention outcomes. Participants were categorized based on their chosen dietary interventions, particularly distinguishing between intermittent fasting and alternative dietary approaches. The study systematically evaluated various parameters, including regular adherence, physiological effects, psychological impacts, and barriers to maintenance. Statistical analysis utilized chi-square and Fischer's exact tests for categorical variables, while independent t-tests were employed for continuous variables. Results This study encompassed 432 participants, with demographically diverse participants characterized by a predominance of urban residents (295, 68.3%), highly educated individuals (383, 88.6%), and students (190, 44%).

    "abstract": "This review examines the long-term efficacy and safety of various nutritional and pharmacological strategies for managing obesity. The focus is on the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet), very low-energy ketogenic therapy (VLEKT), and pharmacological interventions such as naltrexone/bupropion and liraglutide. Given the chronic nature of obesity, understanding the sustainability and impact of these treatments over time is critical. The MedDiet has shown significant benefits for cardiovascular health and moderate long-term weight loss, though it does not always outperform other diets in terms of weight reduction. VLEKT is highly effective for rapid weight loss, but concerns remain about its long-term sustainability. Pharmacological treatments, including naltrexone/bupropion and liraglutide, have shown promise in promoting significant weight loss and improving metabolic markers. However, issues related to long-term adherence and potential side effects need further exploration. Both nutritional and pharmacological strategies offer valuable tools in obesity management. While treatments like VLEKT and pharmacological options provide significant short-term benefits, the MedDiet remains a sustainable long-term approach. The long-term efficacy and safety of naltrexone/bupropion and liraglutide require more investigation to address challenges in weight maintenance and side effects. Further studies are needed to establish the optimal duration and combination of these therapies for sustained obesity management.",

    "abstract": "Older patients with cancer (65 years and older) are a growing population with unique nutrition-and treatment-related issues that accelerate aging. Nutrition interventions attenuate nutritional decline, muscle loss, and risk of malnutrition and sarcopenia in patients with cancer, however the evidence for older patients with cancer is limited. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the efficacy of nutrition interventions on nutritional status, body weight/composition and clinical outcomes in older patients with cancer and to identify future research priority areas. Three databases were systematically searched from inception until January 2024. Eligible studies were randomised controlled trials (RCT) evaluating a nutrition intervention in older patients with cancer that reported nutrition-related and clinical outcomes. Studies including older patients were determined by the mean age ≥ 65 years with the error to the mean > 60 years. Between-group differences in nutritional and clinical outcomes were extracted. Eleven studies describing nine RCTs were included in this review. Three trials specifically included patients 65 years and older. Most interventions intended to reduce malnutrition risk across a mix of cancer types and treatments, and one trial was designed to reduce comorbidities after treatment. Changes in dietary intake (n = 4), nutrition status (n = 1), weight (n = 5), and muscle mass (n = 3) were inconsistently reported, but preliminary evidence showed dietary counselling with oral nutrition supplements (ONS) resulted in improved weight maintenance in patients with pancreatic cancer. There was limited evidence of a benefit from nutrition interventions on treatment tolerance or quality of life. The heterogeneous findings in methodological design, including dietary prescription and frequency of consultations and reporting of outcomes, inhibits evidence-based recommendations for older adults with cancer. Nutrition interventions designed specifically to address nutrition-related issues unique to older patients with cancer is a clear research priority. Research specifically targeting older patients post treatment, a period during which treatment-related side effects still occur, is limited. To support the growing population of older patients with cancer, future research must consistently report the dietary prescription, adherence to nutritional requirements, and clearly-defined nutrition-related parameters and clinical outcomes that are specific to older patients.",

We aimed to analyze whether moderate carbohydrate restriction reduces liver fat in T2D independent of changes in body weight and whether this is accompanied by parallel improvements in plasma lipoprotein subclasses. We determined the density profile of circulating lipoproteins in patients with T2D from 2 previous randomized controlled trials. In the isoenergetic study, 30 participants were allocated in a crossover design to 6 + 6 wk of an isocaloric carbohydrate-reduced high-protein (CRHP, C/P/F = 30/30/40 E%) or conventional diabetes (CD, C/P/F = 50/17/33 E%) diet aimed at weight maintenance. In the hypoenergetic study, 72 participants were allocated in a parallel-group design to 6 wk of a hypocaloric CRHP or CD diet aimed at matched ∼6% weight loss. Both studies provided all meals from a metabolic kitchen to maximize adherence. In the isoenergetic study, the CRHP diet reduced TRL (mean: -33%; 95% CI: -48%, -14%) and LDL Replacing dietary carbohydrate with protein and fat improves dyslipidemia in T2D independently of changes in body weight, by inducing an atheroprotective shift in the lipoprotein particle profile possibly facilitated by reduced IHTG accumulation.

    "title": "A Systematic Review Exploring Dietary Behaviors, Psychological Determinants and Lifestyle Factors Associated with Weight Regain After Bariatric Surgery.",
    "abstract": "Weight regains after bariatric surgery presents a significant challenge to long-term weight management and overall health outcomes. While clinical and surgical factors influencing bariatric outcomes have been extensively reviewed, there remains a notable gap in understanding how behavioral factors-specifically dietary habits, psychological influences, and lifestyle choices-impact long-term weight maintenance. This systematic review addresses this gap, highlighting the unique role of these behavioral factors in sustaining weight loss post-bariatric surgery. This systematic review aims to explore the behavioral factors-including dietary, psychological, and lifestyle influences-associated with weight regain after bariatric surgery. A comprehensive search was conducted across multiple databases, focusing on peer-reviewed articles published in English. We included observational studies exclusively focused on adults who experienced weight regain after bariatric surgery, with an emphasis on behavioral factors. Searches were conducted in MEDLINE via PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar, with the last search completed on 10 July 2024. Studies published within the past 10 years were considered. The Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal tool for cross-sectional studies was used to assess the risk of bias. A total of 16 studies met the inclusion criteria: 12 cross-sectional studies, 3 cohort studies, and 1 in-depth interview study. The review found inconsistencies in the definitions of weight regain across studies. Nonetheless, three primary behavioral factors were identified as potentially contributing to weight regain: dietary non-adherence and eating patterns, psychological determinants, and lifestyle behaviors. Dietary non-adherence included high-calorie food consumption, excessive intake of sweets, carbohydrates, and sweetened beverages, and low protein intake. Psychological factors such as depression, anxiety, emotional eating, and binge eating were prevalent among individuals experiencing weight regain. Lifestyle behaviors, including physical inactivity, smoking, and sedentary habits, also played significant roles. Post-bariatric weight management is multifaceted, necessitating a comprehensive approach that addresses dietary, psychological, and lifestyle factors. Most studies on behavioral factors linked to weight regain were cross-sectional with small sample sizes, limiting the ability to infer causality. Future research should include detailed information on dietary adherence, standardized tools to assess physical activity and sedentary behavior, and validated measures for psychological health. Tailored interventions and continuous support from healthcare professionals are essential for maximizing the effectiveness of bariatric surgery, promoting sustainable weight loss, and enhancing overall health outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Lifestyle intervention can produce clinically significant weight loss and reduced disease risk/severity for many individuals with overweight/obesity. Dietary lapses, instances of non-adherence to the recommended dietary goal(s) in lifestyle intervention, are associated with less weight loss and higher energy intake. There are distinct \"types\" of dietary lapse (e.g., eating an off-plan food, eating a larger portion), and behavioral, psychosocial, and contextual mechanisms may differ across dietary lapse types. Some lapse types also appear to impact weight more than others. Elucidating clear lapse types thus has potential for understanding and improving adherence to lifestyle intervention. This 18-month observational cohort study will use real-time digital assessment tools within a multi-level factor analysis framework to uncover \"lapse phenotypes\" and understand their impact on clinical outcomes. Adults with overweight/obesity ( This trial is ongoing; data collection began on 31 October 2022 and is scheduled to complete by February 2027. Results will inform novel precision tools to improve dietary adherence in lifestyle intervention, and support updated theoretical models of adherence behavior.

    "abstract": "Weight loss can positively alter female physiology; however, whether dietary carbohydrate- or fat- restriction confer unique effects is less studied. Precisely designed, hypocaloric well-formulated ketogenic diets (KD; ~75% energy for weight maintenance) were compared to isocaloric/isonitrogenous low-fat diet (LFD) on self-reported menses in pre-menopausal overweight and obese women (mean ± SD: 34 ± 10 years, BMI: 32.3 ± 2.7 kg/m2). Women received a precisely-weighed and formulated KD with either twice-daily with ketone salts (KS; n = 6) or a flavor-matched placebo (PL; n = 7) daily for six-weeks. An age and BMI-matched cohort (n = 6) was later assigned to the LFD and underwent the same testing procedures as the KD. Self-reported menses fluctuations were assessed bi-weekly along with measures of body weight, body composition, and fasting serum clinical chemistries using repeated measures ANOVA with Bonferroni post-hoc corrections. Both diets elicited clinically-significant weight-loss (Δ: -7.0 ± 0.5 kg; p < 0.001), primarily from fat-mass (Δ: -4.6 ± 0.3 kg; p < 0.001), and improved insulin-sensitivity and serum lipids (all p < 0.05). Fasting plasma glucose and inflammatory markers were not different between diets. Fasting capillary beta-hydroxybutyrate (R-βHB) increased significantly during the KD, independent of supplementation (Δ: 1.2 ± 0.3 mM R-βHB; p < 0.001). Women randomized to the KD+KS (30%) and KD+PL (43%) reported subjective increases in menses frequency and intensity after 14 days, whereas another third reported a regain of menses (>1 year since the last period) after 28 days. No LFD participants reported menses changes. Nutrient-dense, whole-food KDs and LFD improved weight, BMI, body composition, and blood parameters in pre-menopausal women after six-weeks. Changes in self-reported menses were described by most of the KD participants, but none of the LFD women suggesting there may be unique effects of nutritional ketosis, independent of weight loss.",

    "title": "Do people with type 2 diabetes find continuous and intermittent low-energy diets for weight loss and diabetes remission acceptable?",
    "abstract": "The Manchester Intermittent versus Daily Diet App Study (MIDDAS) tested the feasibility and potential efficacy of two remotely delivered low-energy diet (LED) programmes (800 kcal/day) to support weight loss and remission of type 2 diabetes: continuous [CLED] (8 weeks of daily LED) and intermittent [ILED] (2 days of LED/week for 28 weeks). Understanding participant experiences can help us to understand the acceptability of LED programmes to people with type 2 diabetes, informing future programme development and implementation. Twenty participants (10 CLED; 10 ILED) took part in interviews conducted at the end of the active weight loss phase (CLED week 12, ILED week 28). Interviews were transcribed and analysed thematically using the template analysis approach, with an a priori focus on acceptability. Four themes are presented: prospective acceptability, intervention coherence and perceived effectiveness, opportunity costs and self-efficacy. Both remotely supported CLED and ILED interventions appeared acceptable to participants. CLED participants found the rapid initial weight loss phase comparatively easy and highly motivating but expressed more concerns around weight maintenance. ILED participants found the more gradual weight loss initially frustrating but expressed greater confidence in their longer-term adherence. The importance of continued individualised support from healthcare professionals was emphasised, and evidence of weight loss and improvement in other medical markers through monitoring via the mobile phone app was useful. Different approaches to remotely delivered LEDs appear acceptable; therefore asking patients which approach may be more acceptable to them may be a useful way to offer individualised and tailored support.",

    "title": "What About My Weight? Insufficient Weight Loss or Weight Regain After Bariatric Metabolic Surgery.",
    "abstract": "This review study aimed to investigate the definition, etiology, risk factors (RFs), management strategy, and prevention of insufficient weight loss (IWL) and weight regain (WR) following bariatric metabolic surgery (BMS). Electronic databases were searched to retrieve relevant articles. The inclusion criteria were English articles with adult participants assessing the definition, prevalence, etiology, RFs, management strategy, and prevention of IWL/WR. Definition: The preferred definition for post-BMS IWL/WR are the terms \"Lack of maintenance of total weight loss (TWL)>20%\" and \"weight change in percentage compared to nadir weight or weight loss\". Prevalence: The exact prevalence of IWL/WR is still being determined due to the type of BMS and various definitions. Etiology: Several mechanisms, including hormonal/metabolic, dietary non-adherence, physical inactivity, mental health, and anatomic surgical failure, are possible etiologies of post-BMS IWL/WR. Risk factors: Preoperative body mass index (BMI), male gender, psychiatric conditions, comorbidities, age, poor diet, eating disorders, poor follow-ups, insufficient physical activity, micronutrients, and genetic-epigenetic factors are the most important RFs. Management Strategy: The basis of treatment is lifestyle interventions, including dietary, physical activity, psychological, and behavioral therapy. Pharmacotherapy can be added. In the last treatment line, different techniques of endoscopic surgery and revisional surgery can be used. Prevention: Behavioral and psychotherapeutic interventions, dietary therapy, and physical activity therapy are the essential components of prevention. Many definitions exist for WR, less so for IWL. Etiologies and RFs are complex and multifactorial; therefore, the management and prevention strategy is multidisciplinary. Some knowledge gaps, especially for IWL, exist, and these gaps must be filled to strengthen the evidence used to guide patient counseling, selection, and improved outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Time-restricted meal intake (TRM) has shown potential benefits such as enhanced insulin sensitivity, lowered blood sugar levels, and possible weight loss in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Our study aimed to investigate the impact of TRM on lipid profile parameters such as total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) in fasting conditions in T2DM patients. In total, 400 patients from the endocrinology department at King George's Medical University (KGMU), Lucknow were enrolled in this study, adhering to the guidelines of the American Diabetes Association (ADA). Male and female patients with recently diagnosed T2DM (in the past five years), aged between 25 to 60 years, on oral anti-diabetic therapy excluding insulin, expressing willingness to provide written consent and to adhere to TRM were included in the TRM group. It was a longitudinal study as diabetic dyslipidemia is primarily caused by insulin resistance and nutritional reasons and we wanted to assess the effect of TRM on lipid profile in T2DM patients. Patients were enrolled via simple random sampling using the random number table method (computerized). The TRM group had an early dinner at 7 pm whereas the control group was of non-TRM/late-night eaters. TRM group was given comprehensive guidance including strategies to manage hunger, permissible beverage options (water and prescribed medication) during the fasting period, and daily maintenance of a diary documenting their timing, type, and quantity of food intake which they were requested to bring fortnightly. Emphasis was placed on recording even minor dietary items consumed throughout the day. The TRM group consumed food ad libitum during a 12-hour eating window from breakfast at 7 am to dinner at 7 pm. Data distribution was non-parametric. Mann-Whitney U test compared TRM and control group using mean values at baseline and follow-ups. Analysis used GraphPad Prism 9.2.0 software (GraphPad Inc., La Jolla, CA). A p-value less than 0.05 (p < 0.05) was considered statistically significant. A total of 127 patients were lost to follow-up, resulting in 273 patients who completed the study. The mean value of TC in the TRM and non-TRM groups using the Mann-Whitney U test registered a highly significant p-value <0.0001 at 18 months, with a decrease of 14.17% from baseline in the TRM group and a decrease of 1.53% from baseline in the non-TRM group. The TRM group had a decrease of 24.75% in TG from a baseline value of 145.4±41.9, whereas the non-TRM group showed a decrease of 2.2% from a baseline value of 154.7±37.30 (p-value <0.0001). The TRM group showed an increase of 9.25% in HDL from a baseline value of 50.14±8.58; the non-TRM group showed an increase of 0.82% from a baseline value of 48.62±9.31 (p-value <0.0001). TRM group showed a decrease of 8.62% in LDL from a baseline value of 68.20±16.2 while the non-TRM group showed an increase of 1.54% from a baseline value of 65.38±19.3 (p-value <0.0002). The TRM group showed a decrease of 13.97% in VLDL from a baseline value of 32.20±18.7; the non-TRM group showed an increase of 4% from a baseline value of 30.16±24.2 (p-value <0.0001). Our study's promising results underscore the potential of TRM as an effective strategy for managing dyslipidemia in individuals with T2DM, even over prolonged periods.",

    "abstract": "New obesity medications result in large weight losses. However, long-term adherence in a real-world setting is challenging, and termination of obesity medication results in weight regain towards pre-treatment body weight. Therefore, we investigated whether weight loss and improved body composition are sustained better at 1 year after termination of active treatment with glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, supervised exercise program, or both combined for 1 year. We conducted a post-treatment study in extension of a randomised, controlled trial in Copenhagen. Adults with obesity (aged 18-65 years and initial body mass index 32-43 kg/m Between Dec 17, 2018, and Dec 17, 2020, 109 participants attended the post-treatment study. From randomisation to one year after termination of combined exercise and liraglutide treatment (week 0-104), participants had reduced body weight (-5.1 kg [95% CI -10.0; -0.2]; P = 0.040) and body-fat percentage (-2.3%-points [-4.3 to -0.3]; P = 0.026) compared with after termination of liraglutide alone. More participants who had previously received combination treatment maintained a weight loss of at least 10% of initial body weight one year after treatment termination (week -8 to 104) compared with participants who had previously received placebo (odds ratio [OR] 7.2 [2.4; 21.3]) and liraglutide (OR 4.2 [1.6; 10.8]). More participants who had previously received supervised exercise maintained a weight loss of at least 10% compared with placebo (OR 3.7 [1.2; 11.1]). During the year after termination of treatment (week 52-104), weight regain was 6.0 kg [2.1; 10.0] larger after termination of liraglutide compared with after termination of supervised exercise and 2.5 kg [-1.5 to 6.5] compared with after termination of combination treatment. The addition of supervised exercise to obesity pharmacotherapy seems to improve healthy weight maintenance after treatment termination compared with treatment termination of obesity pharmacotherapy alone. Body weight and body composition were maintained one year after termination of supervised exercise, in contrast to weight regain after termination of treatment with obesity pharmacotherapy alone.

We explored potential thresholds for dietary self-monitoring during a 9-month maintenance period following a 3-month weight-loss program in 74 adults with overweight or obesity (mean [SD] age = 50.7 [10.4] years, BMI = 31.2 [4.5] kg/m Greater self-monitoring was correlated with less weight regain for thresholds of ≥3 days/week, with the largest benefit observed for thresholds of ≥5 to ≥6 days/week (all p < 0.05); significant weight gain was observed for thresholds of ≥1 to ≥2 days/week, whereas no change in weight was observed for thresholds of ≥3 to ≥4 days/week, and weight loss was observed with thresholds of ≥5 or more days/week. Results demonstrate that self-monitoring at least 3 days/week may be beneficial for supporting long-term maintenance, although greater benefit (in relation to weight loss) may be realized at thresholds of 5 to 6 days/week.

    "abstract": "The UK Diabetes Remission Clinical Trial (DiRECT) study was replicated in an Australian primary care setting. This qualitative study aimed to explore and understand the perceptions and experiences of both participants and healthcare professionals (HCPs) involved in the DiRECT-Australia Type 2 Diabetes Remission Service. All participants and HCPs delivering the service were invited to participate in semi-structured interviews via online videoconferencing. The interview guides explored perceptions and experiences in DiRECT-Australia, covering aspects such as barriers and facilitators to recruitment and participation, motivations and challenges across service phases, adequacy of support provided and the overall acceptability of the service. All interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using thematic analysis. Eight DiRECT-Australia participants and six HCPs (three general practitioners, two practice nurses and one dietitian) participated. Four overarching themes were identified: (1) Enablers and barriers to recruitment and continuous participation in DiRECT-Australia; (2) Motivators and overcoming barriers across the total diet replacement, food reintroduction and weight maintenance phases; (3) Importance of participant-HCP interactions and continuous support; (4) Acceptance and long-term need for DiRECT-Australia. Adherence to total diet replacement was less challenging than anticipated by participants. Transitioning to the food reintroduction phase was difficult but overcome through HCP support. DiRECT-Australia was well accepted by both participants and HCPs, and participants expressed willingness to continue with the service, if provided on a long-term basis. Both participants and HCPs were highly interested in the new diabetes remission service set up in an Australian primary care setting. The acceptability of DiRECT-Australia was underscored by participants emphasising the effectiveness of the service in achieving significant weight loss and diabetes remission. There is a need for long-term and wider implementation of the service to ensure that anyone with recent onset type 2 diabetes is offered the best possible chance to achieve remission.",

    "abstract": "Time-restricted eating (TRE), a type of intermittent fasting in which all daily calories are consumed within a window of ≤12 hours, is hypothesized to promote long-term weight management because of its relative simplicity. This study reports correlates of adherence among community-dwelling adults currently or formerly following a TRE dietary strategy. A 25-minute cross-sectional online survey was developed, including questions about TRE perceptions, behaviors, motivators and drivers, and demographics. The survey was administered in February 2021 via Prolific, an online platform for sample recruitment and survey dissemination. Eligibility criteria included US adult ages 18+ who currently or formerly (past 3 months) followed TRE (ie, consumed all daily calories within a window of ≤12 hours) for a minimum of 1 week. χ Current followers (n = 296, mean [SD]: 34.2 ± 12.2y) were older than former followers (n = 295, mean [SD]: 31.1 ± 10.9 y) and practiced TRE for longer (median: 395 vs 90 days, P < 0.001). Current followers reported more success with meeting TRE goals (P ≤ 0.015), were less likely to report TRE concerns (P < 0.001), and more likely to report TRE satisfaction (P < 0.001). Four TRE motivators were more important among current (vs former) followers: weight maintenance, health (not weight), improved sleep, and preventing disease (P ≤ 0.017); weight loss was more important among former (vs current) followers (P = 0.003). Among adherence drivers, ability to work from home and the impact of COVID-19 were reported as more helpful for TRE adherence among current compared with former followers (P ≤ 0.028). TRE motivators and drivers differed between current and former followers; interventions tailored to individuals' preferences and circumstances may benefit TRE adherence.",

The use of digital devices in healthcare aims to respond to the patient's needs, in order to make obesity treatment more accessible, so our study aims to assess the safety and efficacy of a Digital Therapy for Obesity App (DTxO) for achieving weight loss and its maintenance in patients affected with obesity undergoing an experimental non-pharmacological treatment. Here we present the study protocol of a prospective, multicenter, pragmatic, randomized, double-arm, placebo-controlled, parallel, single-blind study on obese patients who will be treated with a new digital therapy to obtain an improvement in their disease condition through the application of different simultaneous strategies (a dietary regimen and personalized advice program, a tailored physical exercise program, a cognitive-behavioural assessment and program, alerts and reminders, dedicated section on prescribed drugs intake, and chat and online visits with clinical professionals). We believe that DTxO will offer a promising intervention channel and self-regulation tool holding the potentiality to decrease treatment burden and treat more patients thanks to the partial replacement of traditional medical consultation with digital or telephone management, improving self- engagement and reducing the high demands the \"obesity pandemic\" for both patients and national health services in terms of time, cost, and effort.

    "abstract": "To identify endometrial cancer survivors' (ECS) barriers and facilitators for participation in lifestyle interventions to improve their dietary and exercise behaviors. Our secondary objective is to determine baseline information: physical activity level, quality of life (QoL), and impact of COVID-19 on exercise, diet, and mental health. Obese, early-stage ECS participated in 2-part mixed-methods data collection; Part 1: survey gathering sample characteristics, QoL, exercise, and basic endometrial cancer- related knowledge. Part 2: virtual focus group or individual interviews using a brainwriting premortem protocol. Statistical analysis was performed using SAS (version 8.3). Qualitative data were analyzed using deductive thematic coding guided by the RE-AIM framework. Twenty percent (70/358) of ECS from a survivorship database and clinic recruitment completed the survey; 16 ECS provided qualitative feedback. Common barriers to intervention participation included time and resource costs, meeting frequency, and pessimism about weight loss maintenance. Facilitators included an opportunity to connect with other survivors and a focus on health rather than weight loss. Most ECS could not identify exercise guidelines (60%) and 83% were not meeting these guidelines. Higher BMI was correlated with a lower confidence in completing in moderate physical activity (p-value = 0.0206). Post-COVID-19 pandemic, physical activity, nutritional decisions, and/or mental health worsened for 67% of ECS. ECS are a disparate population, with worsening behaviors and mental health following the pandemic. The identified ECS-specific barriers and facilitators to behavioral intervention participation are being used to simultaneously improve the reach of and adherence to a lifestyle intervention aimed at improving their health and QoL.",

Individuals who ranked MVPA as a primary strategy for weight control at concurrent time points, compared to those who did not, engaged in significantly more MVPA at post-treatment, had greater weight loss at follow-up, endorsed fewer barriers to PA at post-treatment and follow-up, and reported greater exercise enjoyment at baseline and post-treatment. Perceived importance of MVPA was related to subjective experiences of MVPA, MVPA adherence, and weight loss in a long-term BWL intervention.",

Fifteen participants who completed or dropped out from either a daily energy restriction or intermittent fasting group were recruited using maximum variation purposive sampling. In-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted at the 2-month follow-up phase. All interviews were transcribed and analysed using thematic analysis, guided by behaviour change models including transtheoretical model, social cognitive theory and integrated model of change. Participants following both diets showed similar behaviour change patterns. Their first motivations were mostly external and relied on 'accountability' to adhere to the diet when initiating the dietary changes. Participants highlighted the importance of frequent reviews and monitoring in assisting their adherence. This feedback system promoted the development of self-efficacy and internalised motivation to encourage an 'ownership'. Participants who transitioned successfully from relying on accountability to take 'ownership' of the intervention were more capable of tackling challenges and tailoring their diet to form a new routine for long-term maintenance. External motivations were key to initiate while internalised motivations were more important to sustain the behaviour change. Health professionals can assist this process through routine monitoring and feedback processes in clinical practice.",

Participants were randomly assigned to receive 100 capsules containing their own fecal microbiota or placebo over 8 m-14 m in ten administrations (adherence rate > 90%). Gut microbiome composition was evaluated using shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Non-core taxa were defined as ≤ 66% prevalence across participants. Overall, 450 species were analyzed. At baseline, 13.3% were classified as core, and Firmicutes presented the highest core proportion by phylum.

    "title": "Patterns and Predictors of Engagement With Digital Self-Monitoring During the Maintenance Phase of a Behavioral Weight Loss Program: Quantitative Study.",
    "abstract": "Long-term self-monitoring (SM) of weight, diet, and exercise is commonly recommended by behavioral weight loss (BWL) treatments. However, sustained SM engagement is notoriously challenging; therefore, more must be learned about patterns of engagement with digital SM tools during weight loss maintenance (WLM). In addition, insight into characteristics that may influence SM engagement could inform tailored approaches for participants at risk for poor adherence. This study explored patterns of digital SM of weight, diet, and exercise during WLM (aim 1) and examined timing, patterns, and rates of disengagement and reengagement (aim 2). This study also assessed relationships between individual-level factors (weight-related information avoidance and weight bias internalization) and SM engagement (aim 3). Participants were 72 adults enrolled in a BWL program consisting of a 3-month period of weekly treatment designed to induce weight loss (phase I), followed by a 9-month period of less frequent contact to promote WLM (phase II). Participants were prescribed daily digital SM of weight, diet, and exercise. At baseline, self-report measures assessed weight-related information avoidance and weight bias internalization. SM adherence was objectively measured with the days per month that participants tracked weight, diet, and exercise. Repeated-measures ANOVA examined differences in adherence across SM targets. Multilevel modeling examined changes in adherence across phase II. Relationships between individual-level variables and SM adherence were assessed with Pearson correlations, 2-tailed independent samples t tests, and multilevel modeling. During WLM, consistently high rates of SM (≥50% of the days in each month) were observed for 61% (44/72) of the participants for exercise, 40% (29/72) of the participants for weight, and 21% (15/72) of the participants for diet. Adherence for SM of exercise was higher than that for weight or diet (P<.001). Adherence decreased over time for all SM targets throughout phase II (P<.001), but SM of exercise dropped off later in WLM (mean 10.07, SD 2.83 months) than SM of weight (mean 7.92, SD 3.23 months) or diet (mean 7.58, SD 2.92 months; P<.001). Among participants with a period of low SM adherence (ie, <50% of the days in a month), only 33% (17/51 for weight, 19/57 for diet) to 46% (13/28 for exercise) subsequently had ≥1 months with high adherence. High weight-related information avoidance predicted a faster rate of decrease in dietary SM (P<.001). Participants with high weight bias internalization had the highest rates of weight SM (P=.03). Participants in BWL programs have low adherence to the recommendation to sustain daily SM during WLM, particularly for SM of diet and weight. Weight-related information avoidance and weight bias internalization may be relevant indicators for SM engagement. Interventions may benefit from innovative strategies that target participants at key moments of risk for disengagement.",

    "title": "An Overview of Diet and Physical Activity for Healthy Weight in Adolescents and Young Adults with Type 1 Diabetes: Lessons Learned from the ACT1ON Consortium.",
    "abstract": "The prevalence of overweight and obesity in young people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) now parallels that of the general population. Excess adiposity increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, which is already elevated up to 10-fold in T1D, underscoring a compelling need to address weight management as part of routine T1D care. Sustainable weight management requires both diet and physical activity (PA). Diet and PA approaches must be optimized towards the underlying metabolic and behavioral challenges unique to T1D to support glycemic control throughout the day. Diet strategies for people with T1D need to take into consideration glycemic management, metabolic status, clinical goals, personal preferences, and sociocultural considerations. A major barrier to weight management in this high-risk population is the challenge of integrating regular PA with day-to-day management of T1D. Specifically, exercise poses a substantial challenge due to the increased risk of hypoglycemia and/or hyperglycemia. Indeed, about two-thirds of individuals with T1D do not engage in the recommended amount of PA. Hypoglycemia presents a serious health risk, yet prevention and treatment often necessitates the consumption of additional calories, which may prohibit weight loss over time. Exercising safely is a concern and challenge with weight management and maintaining cardiometabolic health for individuals living with T1D and many healthcare professionals. Thus, a tremendous opportunity exists to improve exercise participation and cardiometabolic outcomes in this population. This article will review dietary strategies, the role of combined PA and diet for weight management, current resources for PA and glucose management, barriers to PA adherence in adults with T1D, as well as findings and lessons learned from the Advancing Care for Type 1 Diabetes and Obesity Network (ACT1ON).",

    "abstract": "Obesity is a chronic disease resulting from multifactorial causes mainly related to lifestyle (sedentary lifestyle, inadequate eating habits) and to other conditions such as genetic, hereditary, psychological, cultural, and ethnic factors. The weight loss process is slow and complex, and involves lifestyle changes with an emphasis on nutritional therapy, physical activity practice, psychological interventions, and pharmacological or surgical treatment. Because the management of obesity is a long-term process, it is essential that the nutritional treatment contributes to the maintenance of the individual's global health. The main diet-related causes associated with excess weight are the high consumption of ultraprocessed foods, which are high in fats, sugars, and have high energy density; increased portion sizes; and low intake of fruits, vegetables, and grains. In addition, some situations negatively interfere with the weight loss process, such as fad diets that involve the belief in superfoods, the use of teas and phytotherapics, or even the avoidance of certain food groups, as has currently been the case for foods that are sources of carbohydrates. Individuals with obesity are often exposed to fad diets and, on a recurring basis, adhere to proposals with promises of quick solutions, which are not supported by the scientific literature. The adoption of a dietary pattern combining foods such as grains, lean meats, low-fat dairy, fruits, and vegetables, associated with an energy deficit, is the nutritional treatment recommended by the main international guidelines. Moreover, an emphasis on behavioral aspects including motivational interviewing and the encouragement for the individual to develop skills will contribute to achieve and maintain a healthy weight. Therefore, this Position Statement was prepared based on the analysis of the main randomized controlled studies and meta-analyses that tested different nutrition interventions for weight loss. Topics in the frontier of knowledge such as gut microbiota, inflammation, and nutritional genomics, as well as the processes involved in weight regain, were included in this document. This Position Statement was prepared by the Nutrition Department of the Brazilian Association for the Study of Obesity and Metabolic Syndrome (ABESO), with the collaboration of dietitians from research and clinical fields with an emphasis on strategies for weight loss.",

    "abstract": "Cytotoxicity (i.e. cell death) is the core mechanism by which chemotherapy induces its anti-cancer effects. Unfortunately, this same mechanism underpins the collateral damage it causes to healthy tissues. The gastrointestinal tract is highly susceptible to chemotherapy's cytotoxicity, resulting in ulcerative lesions (termed gastrointestinal mucositis, GI-M) that impair the functional capacity of the gut leading to diarrhea, anorexia, malnutrition and weight loss, which negatively impact physical/psychological wellbeing and treatment adherence. Preventing these side effects has proven challenging given the overlapping mechanisms that dictate chemotherapy efficacy and toxicity. Here, we report on a novel dietary intervention that, due to its localized gastrointestinal effects, is able to protect the intestinal mucosal from unwanted toxicity without impairing the anti-tumor effects of chemotherapy. The test diet (containing extensively hydrolyzed whey protein and medium chain triglycerides (MCTs)), was investigated in both tumor-naïve and tumor-bearing models to evaluate its effect on GI-M and chemo-efficacy, respectively. In both models, methotrexate was used as the representative chemotherapeutic agent and the diet was provided ad libitum for 14 days prior to treatment. GI-M was measured using the validated biomarker plasma citrulline, and chemo-efficacy defined by tumor burden (cm",

    "abstract": "Background The American Heart Association defines ideal cardiovascular health based on 8 risk factors (Life's Essential 8 [LE8]); a high LE8 score (range 0-100) reflects greater adherence to their recommendations. Weight status influences cardiovascular health, yet individuals may use detrimental diet and weight loss strategies to improve weight status. We assessed differences in LE8 adherence, diet quality, and weight loss strategies between those with and without a recent history of clinically significant weight loss (CSWL). Methods and Results Data from 2007 to 2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey questionnaires, clinical measures, and 24-hour dietary recalls were assessed to determine LE8 adherence, diet quality (Healthy Eating Index), and weight loss strategies between adults with: (1) intentional CSWL ≥5%; and (2) non-CSWL <5%, weight maintenance, or weight gain over the past 12 months using ANCOVA and chi-square tests. Those with CSWL demonstrated higher scores for diet quality (",

This review summarizes the main nutritional deficiencies before and after BS, as well as current dietary and supplementation recommendations to avoid them. Likewise, we have reviewed all those aspects that in recent years have been shown to be related to postoperative weight loss (WL) and its subsequent maintenance, such as hormonal changes, dietary patterns, changes in food preference, adherence to recommendations and follow-up, genetic factors and microbiota, among others. Despite all the knowledge, nutritional deficiencies and weight regain after BS are frequent. It is essential to continue studying in this field in order to establish more precise recommendations according to the individual characteristics of patients. It is also a major objective to understand more deeply the role of the factors involved in WL and its maintenance. This will allow the development of precision treatments and nutrition for patients with obesity, optimizing their benefit after BS.",

    "abstract": "Participants who receive continued coach contact following behavioral weight loss treatment are more successful in maintaining their weight loss long-term. The current study examines whether these contacts have dynamic effects, such that participants are most adherent to the prescribed weight loss behaviors in the days after the call, when motivation and goal salience may be heightened, than they are as time goes on. The current study examined the trajectory of calorie intake, physical activity, weight, and self-monitoring behavior in the fourteen days after a monthly coaching call among participants completing the maintenance phase of a behavioral weight loss trial. For physical activity outcomes, caloric intake, and weight, there were no changes across time. Participants did have the highest adherence and quality of dietary self-monitoring immediately after the call, which diminished over time. Coach contact may continually renew commitment to this burdensome but critical behavior. Likelihood of self-weighing showed an opposite trend, where participants were more likely to weigh themselves in the days more distal from the coach call. Results can inform the timing and content of future coach contact to promote weight control.",

    "abstract": "Diet forums in social media websites provide an opportunity to glimpse the experience of different weight loss diet strategies reported by tens of thousands of individuals. We analyzed all postings with weight information from the six major Reddit weight loss diet forums (\"subreddits\") as reported by forum participants. Data were collected from January 2011 to April 2020 from all 55,900 users posting weight information. Average start BMI was in the overweight or obese range (26-34 kg/m2), and average goal BMI was in the normal range (21.5-24.5 kg/m2) for all subreddits. There is correlation between start BMI and goal BMI (R2 = 0.63, p < 10-10) and between planned weight loss and reported weight loss (R2 = 0.56, p < 10-10). Approximately 80% of forum participants reported a weight loss that was greater than 5% of their initial body weight. Actual reported weight loss was less than half of goal weight loss. Average reported weight loss and adherence were highest in the keto and loseit subreddits. More upvotes and fewer downvotes were associated with higher reported weight loss in five of the six subreddits. Despite the need for cautious interpretation of these data due to self-selection of users who updated weight loss and the possibility of unreliable weight reports, the study has several findings. Average goal BMI was in the normal weight range, demonstrating a highly unrealistic perception, in a very large lay-public cohort, of the plausibility of losing all excess weight. The success in weight loss and maintenance in self-selected individuals who continued reporting weight for many months may demonstrate the subjective value some individuals can obtain from forum participation.",

    "abstract": "Individual lifestyle targets have been associated with weight loss outcomes, yet few studies have examined associations of one's total lifestyle with weight loss maintenance. We aimed to examine the relationship between lifestyle patterns and weight loss outcomes in weight loss maintainers and regainers. We hypothesized that higher adherence to a broader healthy lifestyle favors maintenance (over regain). This is a cross-sectional analysis of 470 adults (62% women) with a history of overweight/obesity and significant weight loss 12 months before study entry. Participants were classified as maintainers (current weight ≤90% maximum weight) or regainers. They were asked to fill in a series of questionnaires on demographics and lifestyle habits (dietary intake and eating behaviors through two 24-hour recalls, physical activity, and sleep). A total Mediterranean Lifestyle Index (total-MLI, range 0-13) was generated by summing up ratings in the lifestyle domain quartiles (diet quality, physical activity, and sleep habits) and dietary behaviors (seasonal food and vegetable intake, intake of traditional foods, responsibility for food preparation, conviviality). Maintainers scored higher in the total-MLI than regainers (6.93 ± 2.31 vs 5.78 ± 2.49, P < .001). Adherence to the total-MLI was associated with 28% higher odds for weight loss maintenance (per unit increment) in linear analyses. Being in the highest total-MLI quartile was associated with 5.27 (95% CI, 2.77-10.02) odds for maintenance. Higher adherence to a comprehensive Mediterranean lifestyle pattern was associated with higher odds for weight loss maintenance. Our findings suggest that even modest shifts toward a healthier living may contribute to favorable weight loss outcomes.",

    "title": "Couples-based behaviour change interventions to reduce metabolic syndrome risk. A systematic review.",
    "abstract": "Metabolic Syndrome (MetS), is a major risk factor for non-communicable diseases including type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Although MetS risk is transferred via the epigenome from both biological parents, periconceptional lifestyle interventions are generally directed towards mothers. There is a need for interventions to reflect the shared nature of epigenetic MetS risk between both biological parents. Couples-based lifestyle interventions have previously been used to improve adherence to behaviour change in conditions with shared risk responsibility such as sexually transmitted diseases. This systematic literature review sought to answer the research question: Are couples-based interventions more effective than individual interventions to address overweight and obesity as the primary modifiable risk for MetS in addition to other associated factors. Couples-based studies involving randomised controlled trials, published between 01/01/1990-31/12/2021, were identified in Medline, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Psychology and Behavioural Sciences Collection, Cochrane, and Scopus. After screening 4742 articles, only five eligible trials remained. Statistically significant post-intervention maintenance of low glycaemic levels was observed in one study. Otherwise, no statistically significant group differences between couples' groups and control groups were observed in any of the five included studies. The included studies concluded that couple-based interventions can lead to weight reduction, maintenance, and adherence to modified health behaviours similar to interventions that target individuals. Overall, the findings indicate that, notwithstanding the paucity of authentic couples-based interventions, there is potential for such approaches to moderate MetS risk factors likely to flow onto epigenetic transmission of risk.",

    "abstract": "Approximately 42% of American adults are living with obesity, increasing their risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). Efficacious approaches to prevent and treat obesity may reduce CRC incidence. Daily calorie restriction (Cal-R) is the most common approach to treating obesity, yet clinically meaningful weight loss is elusive owing to waning adherence. Time-restricted eating (TRE) consists of consuming foods within a specified time frame, creating a natural calorie deficit. TRE in animals shows cancer protective effects. In humans, TRE is safe and acceptable among adults with obesity, producing ~3% to 5% weight loss and reductions in oxidative stress and insulin resistance. However, TRE has not been tested rigorously for CRC preventive effects. The authors describe a 12-month randomized controlled trial of 8-hour TRE (ad libitum 12 PM-8 PM), Cal-R (25% restriction daily), or Control among 255 adults at increased risk for CRC and with obesity. Effects on the following will be examined: 1) body weight, body composition, and adherence; 2) circulating metabolic, inflammation, and oxidative stress biomarkers; 3) colonic mucosal gene expression profiles and tissue microenvironment; and 4) maintenance of benefits on body weight/composition and CRC risk markers. This study will examine efficacious lifestyle strategies to treat obesity and reduce CRC risk among individuals with obesity.",

    "abstract": "The standard of care for treating overweight and obesity is daily caloric restriction (DCR). While this approach produces modest weight loss, adherence to DCR declines over time and weight regain is common. Intermittent fasting (IMF) is an alternative dietary strategy for reducing energy intake (EI) that involves >60% energy restriction on 2-3 days per week, or on alternate days, with habitual intake on fed days. While numerous studies have evaluated IMF as a weight loss strategy, there are several limitations including lack of a standard-of-care DCR control, failure to provide guideline-based behavioral support, and failure to rigorously evaluate dietary and PA adherence using objective measures. To date, only three longer-term (52-week) trials have evaluated IMF as a weight loss strategy. None of these longer-duration studies reported significant differences between IMF and DCR in changes in weight. However, each of these studies has limitations that prohibit drawing generalizable conclusions about the relative long-term efficacy of IMF vs. DCR for obesity treatment. The Daily Caloric Restriction vs. Intermittent Fasting Trial (DRIFT) is a two-arm, 52-week block randomized (1:1) clinical weight loss trial. The two intervention arms (DCR and IMF) are designed to prescribe an equivalent average weekly energy deficit from baseline weight maintenance energy requirements. Both DCR and IMF will be provided guideline-based behavioral support and a PA prescription. The primary outcome is change in body weight at 52 weeks. Secondary outcomes include changes in body composition (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA)), metabolic parameters, total daily energy expenditure (TDEE, doubly labeled water (DLW)), EI (DLW intake-balance method, 7-day diet diaries), and patterns of physical activity (PA, activPAL device). Although DCR leads to modest weight loss success in the short-term, there is wide inter-individual variability in weight loss and poor long-term weight loss maintenance. Evidence-based dietary approaches to energy restriction that are effective long-term are needed to provide a range of evidence-based options to individuals seeking weight loss. The DRIFT study will evaluate the long-term effectiveness of IMF vs. DCR on changes in objectively measured weight, EI, and PA, when these approaches are delivered using guideline-based behavioral support and PA prescriptions.",

    "abstract": "Overweight and obesity are serious public health concerns. As the prevalence of excess weight among individuals continues to increase, there is a parallel need for inexpensive, highly accessible, and evidence-based weight loss programs. This weight loss trial will aim to examine the efficacy of the Noom weight loss program in comparison to a digital control after a 6-month intervention phase and a 24-month maintenance phase, with assessments continuing for 2 years beyond the intervention (to 30 months-after the baseline). The secondary outcomes include quality of life, psychosocial functioning, sleep quality, physical activity, diet, and health status. This trial will also examine the severity of obesity-related functional impairment, weight loss history, and demographic moderators, along with adherence and self-efficacy as mediators of the outcome. A total of 600 participants were randomized in a parallel-group, controlled trial to either Noom Healthy Weight Program (intervention) or Noom Healthy Weight Control (control) for a 6-month intervention. Both intervention and control groups include diet and exercise recommendations, educational content, daily logging capabilities, and daily weigh-in entries. The Noom Healthy Weight Program also includes a coach support for weight loss. Remote follow-up assessments of eating, physical activity, psychosocial factors, app use data, and weight will be conducted at 1, 4, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30 months after baseline. Weight is measured at each follow-up point during a Zoom call using the participants' scales. Enrollment began in March 2021 and the 6-month intervention phase ended in March 2022. Data collection for the final assessment will be completed in March 2024. This study tests commercially available digital lifestyle interventions for individuals with overweight and obesity seeking weight loss support. Data obtained from the study will evaluate whether the Noom Healthy Weight Control Program can help individuals overcome weight loss, achieve long-term maintenance, adhere to lifestyle changes, and feature use barriers that are present in other traditional weight loss treatments.

Clinical practice guidelines for the nutritional management of diabetes have evolved considerably over the last 25 years shifting from a focus on single nutrients to food- and dietary pattern-based recommendations. Use of meal replacements as a temporary short-term strategy to induce weight loss and then transitioning to a healthier dietary pattern (e.g., Mediterranean or Portfolio) for weight loss maintenance fits well with this new shift in focus of clinical practice guidelines. As adherence is the most important determinant for attaining the benefits of any diet, health professionals should recommend evidence-based dietary patterns (including meal replacements) that align best with the patient's values, preferences, and treatment goals.",

    "abstract": "Bariatric surgery is indicated for treatment of severely obese people and can lead to significant weight loss as well as reduction of comorbidities associated with obesity. The present study aims to investigate the relationship between different psychological factors (e.g., tendency to binge eating, impulsivity, alexithymia), adherence to the nutritional plan, and weight loss after bariatric surgery. Forty-five candidates for bariatric surgery accessing a center for the care of obesity were assessed at T0 (pre-surgery) and T1 (6 months post-surgery) through anthropometric and psychometric measures. Simple linear correlations and linear regressions were conducted to evaluate the relationship between the psychological variables, adherence to nutritional plan, and weight loss 6 months after bariatric surgery. Non-planning impulsivity was the principal factor that succeeded in explaining adherence to the diet plan among all the variables considered. Adherence to the nutritional plan and non-planning impulsivity were considered reliable short-term predictors of weight loss after bariatric surgery. This evidence explains the usefulness of promoting research on psychological predictors of outcome in bariatric surgery. Mid- and long-term weight maintenance and quality of life need to be investigated through further follow-up.",

    "abstract": "Changing lifestyle habits to achieve and maintain weight loss can be effective in prevention of Type II diabetes. Ability to resist temptations is considered one of the key factors in behavior change. This study examined how habit strength, motivation, and temptations for an energy-dense diet developed during the maintenance stage of a behavior modification intervention tool. Participants with prediabetes and overweight/obesity were recruited in the two-phase trial PREVIEW with the aim to achieve ≥ 8% body weight loss over 2 months and maintain weight loss over a subsequent 34-month period. The four-stage intervention (PREVIEW Behavior Modification Intervention Toolbox, or PREMIT) supported participants in weight maintenance. Uni- and multivariate analyses were completed from the beginning of the PREMIT maintenance stage (Week 26 of the PREVIEW trial) with 962 individuals who completed the trial. Habit strength and ability to resist temptations increased during the early PREMIT adherence stage (Weeks 26 to 52) before plateauing during middle (Weeks 52 to 104) and late (Weeks 104 to 156) PREMIT adherence stages. Higher habit strength for energy-dense diet was significantly associated with larger weight regain ( Changing diet habits is a complex, multifactorial process, with participants struggling at least with some aspects of weight maintenance. Habits against consuming energy-dense, sweet, and fatty food appeared effective in protecting against weight regain. The observed effect sizes were small, reflecting the complexity of breaking old habits and forming new ones to support long-term maintenance of weight loss.

    "abstract": "Plant-based diets are recommended by dietary guidelines. This secondary analysis aimed to assess longitudinal associations of an overall plant-based diet and specific plant foods with weight-loss maintenance and cardiometabolic risk factors. Longitudinal data on 710 participants (aged 26-70 years) with overweight or obesity and pre-diabetes from the 3-year weight-loss maintenance phase of the PREVIEW intervention were analyzed. Adherence to an overall plant-based diet was evaluated using a novel plant-based diet index, where all plant-based foods received positive scores and all animal-based foods received negative scores. After adjustment for potential confounders, linear mixed models with repeated measures showed that the plant-based diet index was inversely associated with weight regain, but not with cardiometabolic risk factors. Nut intake was inversely associated with regain of weight and fat mass and increments in total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol. Fruit intake was inversely associated with increments in diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol. Vegetable intake was inversely associated with an increment in diastolic blood pressure and triglycerides and was positively associated with an increase in HDL cholesterol. All reported associations with cardiometabolic risk factors were independent of weight change. Long-term consumption of nuts, fruits, and vegetables may be beneficial for weight management and cardiometabolic health, whereas an overall plant-based diet may improve weight management only.",

Electronic health (eHealth) interventions, such as wearable activity monitors and smartphone apps, may promote adherence to regular PA and successful weight loss. This review highlights the evidence for eHealth interventions in promoting PA and reducing weight. Wearables can increase PA and are associated with moderate weight loss in middle/older-aged individuals, with less convincing effects long-term (> 1 year) and in younger people. Data for interventions such as mobile phone applications, SMS, and exergaming are less robust. Investigations of all eHealth interventions are often limited by complex, multi-modality study designs, involving concomitant dietary modification, making the independent contribution of each eHealth intervention on body weight challenging to assess. eHealth interventions may promote PA, thereby contributing to weight loss/weight maintenance; however, further evaluation is required for this approach to be adopted into routine clinical practice.",

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness to promote weight loss maintenance and healthy lifestyle habits of a group educational intervention program, Group Intervention in OBEsity (IGOBE), compared with a usual care therapy to lose weight. Patients with obesity (n = 437; 18.5% men, 18-77 years and 40.4 ± 6.7 kg/m At 12 months of following IGOBE program, the IG achieved greater weight loss (-7.1% of the initial weight) than the CG, which exhibited a weight gain (3.0% of the initial weight). The body weight change induced in the IG was accompanied by a reduction in fat mass, particularly visceral fat and waist circumference. Relevantly, the IG adhered to a healthy dietary pattern and changed its eating habits, which correlated with the improvement in body weight. Intensive educational group treatment that induces a change of eating habits and adherence to healthy dietary pattern is more effective in a long-term to counteract obesity traits than a standard treatment performed individually. The IGOBE program could be a cost-effective practice in the clinical management of obesity.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to report the results of five weight-loss interventions in primary care settings in underserved patients and to compare the level of pragmatism across the interventions using the Pragmatic Explanatory Continuum Indicator Summary (PRECIS-2) tool. Data from 54 primary care clinics (2,210 patients) were pooled from the Promoting Successful Weight Loss in Primary Care in Louisiana (PROPEL) and Rural Engagement in Primary Care for Optimizing Weight Reduction (REPOWER) cluster-randomized trials. Clinics were randomized to one of five comparators: PROPEL usual care, PROPEL combination of in-clinic and telephone visits, REPOWER in-clinic individual visits, REPOWER in-clinic group visits, or REPOWER telephone group visits. At 24 months, weight loss (kilograms) was -0.50 (95% CI: -1.77 to 0.76), -3.05 (-4.10 to -2.01), -4.30 (-5.35 to -3.26), -4.79 (-5.83 to -3.75), and -4.80 (-5.96 to -3.64) in the PROPEL usual care, REPOWER in-clinic individual visits, REPOWER telephone group visits, REPOWER in-clinic group visits, and PROPEL in-clinic and telephone visits arms, respectively. At 24 months, percentage of weight loss was -0.360 (-1.60 to 0.88), -3.00 (-4.02 to -1.98), -4.23 (-5.25 to -3.20), -4.67 (-5.69 to -3.65), and -4.69 (-5.82 to -3.56), respectively, in the five arms. The REPOWER in-clinic individual visits intervention was the most pragmatic and reflects the current Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services funding model, although this intervention produced the least weight loss. Clinically significant weight loss over 6 months in primary care settings is achievable using a variety of lifestyle-based treatment approaches. Longer-term weight-loss maintenance is more difficult to achieve.",

We examined the association between plausible metrics of nonadherence related to dialysis treatment and posttransplant outcomes. Retrospective cohort. We linked national dialysis treatment data with transplant registry data. Adult patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis from January 1, 2004, through December 31, 2014, who received a kidney transplant at a US center. We examined 5 nonadherence metrics: serum potassium level (≥5.2 mEq/L), serum phosphorus level (>5.5 mg/dL), interdialytic weight gain (IDWG; ≥5 L), shortened treatments (≥30 min), and missed treatments (≥1); missed treatment data were available only for 2004-2009. These metrics were characterized per proportion of time under observation. Dialysis observation time was divided into 3-month intervals (quarters), and the number of nonadherent measurements in each domain was calculated for each quarter. Allograft loss, mortality, and acute rejection in the first posttransplant year. Using Cox proportional hazards and logistic regression, we estimated the hazard ratios for graft loss and mortality and odds ratios for rejection. 9,543 patients met inclusion criteria. In our primary model, hyperphosphatemia (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.27 [95% CI, 1.08-1.49]), large IDWG (aHR, 1.39 [95% CI, 1.23-1.59]), and shortened treatments (aHR, 1.54 [95% CI, 1.12-2.13]) were associated with greater rates of allograft loss, but hyperkalemia was not. Large IDWG (aHR, 1.49 [95% CI, 1.29-1.73]) and shortened treatments (aHR, 1.34 [95% CI, 1.13-1.58]) were associated with mortality, whereas hyperkalemia and hyperphosphatemia were not. Only shortened treatments were associated with an increased risk of acute rejection (adjusted odds ratio, 3.88 [95% CI, 1.98-7.58]). In models limited to the years 2004-2009 that included missed treatments, missed treatments were associated only with mortality. Unmeasured confounding (eg, dietary data); adherence metrics used may have multiple, complex causes. Plausible measures of dialysis nonadherence have long-term associations with allograft and patient survival. Behavioral metrics were more closely associated with outcomes than laboratory markers were. The implications of nonadherent behaviors for dialysis patients must be carefully considered before patients are excluded from transplantation.",

    "abstract": "The Diabetes REmission Clinical Trial (DiRECT) has shown that sustained remission of type 2 diabetes in primary care is achievable through weight loss using total diet replacement (TDR) with continued behavioural support. Understanding participants' experiences can help optimise the intervention, support implementation into healthcare, and understand the process of behaviour change. Thirty-four DiRECT participants were recruited into this embedded qualitative evaluation study. In-person and telephone interviews were conducted before the TDR; at week 6-8 of the TDR; 2 weeks into food reintroduction (FR); and at 1 year, to learn about participant experiences with the programme. Transcribed narratives were analysed thematically, and we used interpretation to develop overarching themes. Initiation of the TDR and transition to FR were challenging and required increased behavioural support. In general, adhering to TDR proved easier than the participants had anticipated. Some participants chose the optional extension of TDR. Rapid weight loss and changes in diabetes markers provided ongoing motivation. Further weight loss, behavioural support and occasional use of TDR facilitated weight loss maintenance (WLM). A process of behaviour adaptation to change following regime disruption was identified in three stages: (1) expectations of the new, (2) overcoming difficulties with adherence, and (3) acceptance of continuous effort and establishment of routines. The DiRECT intervention was acceptable and regularity, continuity, and tailoring of behavioural support was instrumental in its implementation in primary care. The adaptation process accounts for some of the individual variability of experiences with the intervention and highlights the need for programme flexibility.",

    "abstract": "Some cognitive profiles might facilitate successful weight loss and its maintenance. Also, weight reductions may result in cognitive benefits. However, little work to date has examined the interactions between cognition and weight changes in the context of interventions with the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet). We studied the within-subject longitudinal relationships between cognition, body mass index (BMI), physical activity (PA), and quality of life (QoL), in older adults following a MedDiet. The PREDIMED-Plus is a primary prevention trial testing the effect of a lifestyle intervention program with an energy-restricted MedDiet (er-MedDiet), weight-loss goals and PA promotion on cardiovascular disease. The PREDIMED-Plus-Cognition sub-study included 487 participants (50% women, mean age 65.2 ± 4.7 years), with overweight/obesity, metabolic syndrome and normal cognitive performance at baseline. A comprehensive neurocognitive test battery was administered at baseline and after 1 and 3 years. Baseline higher performance in verbal memory (OR = 1.5; 95%CI 1.0, 2.1), visuoconstructive praxis and attention (OR = 1.5; 95%CI 0.9, 2.3), and inhibition (OR = 1.3; 95%CI 0.9, 1.9) were associated with a higher odd of achieving at least 8% weight loss after 3 years follow-up in participants randomized to the intervention group. There were moderate improvements in specific tests of memory and executive functions during follow-up. Higher adherence to the er-MedDiet was associated with greater improvements in memory. Women exhibited lower rates of change in global cognition, PA and QoL. Moreover, improvements in memory correlated with reductions in BMI after 1 year (β This study refines the understanding of the determinants and mutual interrelationships between longitudinally-assessed cognitive performance and weight loss, adding further evidence to the cognitive benefits associated with better adherence to a MedDiet. Our results also suggest that weight loss interventions tailored to the cognitive profile and gender of participants are promising avenues for future studies.",

    "abstract": "Unhealthy behaviours, including diet and physical activity, coupled with genetic predisposition, drive type 2 diabetes (T2D) occurrence and severity; the present review aims to summarise the most recent nutritional approaches in T2D, outlining unmet needs. Guidelines consistently suggest reducing energy intake to counteract the obesity epidemic, frequently resulting in sarcopenic obesity, a condition associated with poorer metabolic control and cardiovascular disease. Various dietary approaches have been proposed with largely similar results, with a preference for the Mediterranean diet and the best practice being the diet that patients feel confident of maintaining in the long term based on individual preferences. Patient adherence is indeed the pivotal factor for weight loss and long-term maintenance, requiring intensive lifestyle intervention. The consumption of nutritional supplements continues to increase even if international societies do not support their systematic use. Inositols and vitamin D supplementation, as well as micronutrients (zinc, chromium, magnesium) and pre/probiotics, result in modest improvement in insulin sensitivity, but their use is not systematically suggested. To reach the desired goals, patients should be actively involved in the collaborative development of a personalised meal plan associated with habitual physical activity, aiming at normal body weight and metabolic control.",

    "abstract": "Few reports on the association of population-derived dietary patterns with excess body weight, using the approach of a systematic review currently exist. The aim of the present systematic review was to identify dietary patterns associated with body mass index (BMI), body weight (BW)/BMI change, weight status and weight loss maintenance status. Using MEDLINE (via PubMed) and EBSCO Host databases, we systematically reviewed studies from 1980 to 2020, which included men and women, aged ≥18 years. Primary outcome was BMI or the longitudinal change of individuals' BW or BMI, or weight status (normal weight/overweight/obesity) or weight loss maintenance status. We included observational studies, with or without a prospective design. Studies which met the inclusion criteria were evaluated based on the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale; only  Twenty-six studies were eligible for inclusion in the current analysis. The results indicate a relationship between adherence to a lacto-vegetarian dietary pattern, characterized by high intake of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, unprocessed cereals, dairy and low intake of high-fat foods and sweets, and longitudinal change of individuals' BW or BMI, or the risk of overweight/obesity. Promotion of this healthy dietary pattern, as an alternative to focusing on specific nutrients or foods, may be a promising approach to be included in future long-term weight maintenance interventions.",

    "abstract": "Behavioral weight loss programs combining energy restriction and increased physical activity (PA) are generally successful in producing clinically significant weight loss (≥5%) over 3-6 mos. However, weight maintenance (≥ 2 yrs.) continues to be problematic, due in part to an inability of individuals to continue adherence to diet and PA recommendations. It is hypothesized that neurocognitive processes, specifically executive functions (EFs, i.e., inhibition, working memory, mental flexibility), underlie self-regulation, self-efficacy, and are essential for the adoption and maintenance of health behaviors. Behavioral weight loss programs generally attempt to improve self-regulation; however, these skills are difficult to implement long-term. Strengthening EFs through cognitive training may improve weight maintenance by improving self-efficacy and self-regulation, resulting in improved program attendance and improved adherence to dietary and PA recommendations. Although randomized trials have not been conducted to specifically evaluate this hypothesis, results from the available literature suggest the potential for cognitive training to improve weight maintenance.",

    "abstract": "Overweight and obesity remain serious public health concerns. Outcomes from community based commercial weight management programmes vary, relapse is common and drop out is high. Outcomes could be improved by better understanding experiences on these programmes. The aim of our study was to generate accounts of people's experience on a commercial weight-management program to identify what experiences were perceived as facilitating, and what posed risks, to programme effectiveness and compliance. We conducted individual, semi-structured interviews with eighteen Caucasian women (mean age 45.4y) who were members of nation-wide UK commercial, fee-paying, community weight management programme. Interview data was analysed via framework analysis. Participants' experiences indicated that the programme helped by triggering several intra- and interpersonal processes that catalysed change across psychological, physiological, dietary and behavioural areas of their life. Risks to program adherence and effectiveness spanned well-known risks such as self-regulation fatigue and the difficulty of recovering from negative self-criticism, as well as new factors such as the confusing nature of weight change, the relatively powerful impact of everyday events, and the difficulty in getting the balance right between personalised support vs. intrusion. The complexity of reported experiences challenges the linear, predictive pathways of change proposed by many health behaviour models of weight management. To improve effectiveness, programmes need to go well beyond behavioural and dietary support. It is recommended that community, commercial programmes educate people about the physiological and psychological tensions they will encounter, why people lose weight at different rates, the likelihood of weight relapse and strategies to manage these, including evidence-based support for managing self-criticism.",

    "abstract": "Despite bariatric surgery being the most effective treatment for obesity, some individuals do not respond adequately, especially in the long term. Identifying the predictors of correct weight maintenance in the medium (from 1 to 3 years after surgery) and long term (from 3 years and above) is of vital importance to reduce failure after bariatric surgery; therefore, we summarize the evidence about certain factors, among which we highlight surgical technique, psychological factors, physical activity, adherence to diet, gastrointestinal hormones or neurological factors related to appetite control. We conducted a search in PubMed focused on the last five years (2015-2021). Main findings are as follows: despite Roux-en-Y gastric bypass being more effective in the long term, sleeve gastrectomy shows a more beneficial effectiveness-complications balance; pre-surgical psychological and behavioral evaluation along with post-surgical treatment improve long-term surgical outcomes; physical activity programs after bariatric surgery, in addition to continuous and comprehensive care interventions regarding diet habits, improve weight loss maintenance, but it is necessary to improve adherence; the impact of bariatric surgery on the gut-brain axis seems to influence weight maintenance. In conclusion, although interesting findings exist, the evidence is contradictory in some places, and long-term clinical trials are necessary to draw more robust conclusions.",

Few recent studies directly tested whether lower carbohydrate/glycaemic load or higher fibre diets help to limit weight regain after weight loss and they did not provide evidence supporting a role of a reduction of the carbohydrate or an increase of the fibre content of the diet in the prevention of weight regain after weight loss. Some evidence is emerging that personal characteristics (gut microbiota, glycaemia) may interact with diet composition. but randomized clinical trials are needed to substantiate these claims. There is currently no convincing evidence that lowering dietary carbohydrates has a clinically relevant effect on weight regain after weight loss, unless there is an increase in protein intake at the same time. Further randomized trials are needed to investigate potential interactions with personal characteristics while improving strategies for long-term adherence.",

    "title": "A 1-week diet break improves muscle endurance during an intermittent dieting regime in adult athletes: A pre-specified secondary analysis of the ICECAP trial.",
    "abstract": "Athletes undergoing energy restriction for weight/fat reduction sometimes apply 'diet breaks' involving increased energy intake, but there is little empirical evidence of effects on outcomes. Twenty-six resistance-trained athletes (11/26 or 42% female) who had completed 12 weeks of intermittent energy restriction participated in this study. Participants had a mean (SD) age of 29.3 (6.4) years, a weight of 72.7 (15.9) kg, and a body fat percentage of 21.3 (7.5) %. During the 1-week diet break, energy intake was increased (by means of increased carbohydrate intake) to predicted weight maintenance requirements. While the 1-week diet break had no significant effect on fat mass, it led to small but significant increases in mean body weight (0.6 kg, P<0.001), fat-free mass (0.7 kg, P<0.001) and in resting energy expenditure, from a mean (and 95% confidence interval) of 7000 (6420 to 7580) kJ/day to 7200 (6620 to 7780) kJ/day (P = 0.026). Overall, muscle endurance in the legs (but not arms) improved after the diet break, including significant increases in the work completed by the quadriceps and hamstrings in a maximum-effort 25-repetition set, with values increasing from 2530 (2170 to 2890) J to 2660 (2310 to 3010) J (P = 0.018) and from 1280 (1130 to 1430) J to 1380 (1220 to 1540) J (P = 0.018) following the diet break, respectively. However, muscle strength did not change. Participants reported significantly lower sensations of hunger (P = 0.017), prospective consumption (P = 0.020) and irritability (P = 0.041) after the diet break, and significantly higher sensations of fullness (P = 0.002), satisfaction (P = 0.002), and alertness (P = 0.003). In summary, a 1-week diet break improved muscle endurance in the legs and increased mental alertness, and reduced appetite and irritability. With this considered, it may be wise for athletes to coordinate diet breaks with training sessions that require muscle endurance of the legs and/or mental focus, as well as in the latter parts of a weight loss phase when increases in appetite might threaten dietary adherence.

    "abstract": "Obesity is a chronic disease affecting women at higher rates than men. In an obstetrics and gynecology setting, frequently encountered obesity-related complications are polycystic ovary syndrome, fertility and pregnancy complications, and increased risk of breast and gynecological cancers. Obstetrician-gynecologists (OBGYNs) are uniquely positioned to diagnose and treat obesity, given their role in women's primary health care and the increasing prevalence of obesity-related fertility and pregnancy complications. The metabolic processes of bodyweight regulation are complex, which makes weight-loss maintenance challenging, despite dietary modifications and exercise. Antiobesity medications (AOMs) can facilitate weight loss by targeting appetite regulation. There are four AOMs currently approved for long-term use in the United States, of which liraglutide 3.0 mg is among the most efficacious. Liraglutide 3.0 mg, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA), is superior to placebo in achieving weight loss and improving cardiometabolic profile, in both clinical trial and real-world settings. In addition, women with fertility complications receiving liraglutide 1.8-3.0 mg can benefit from improved ovarian function and fertility. Liraglutide 3.0 mg is generally well tolerated, but associated with transient gastrointestinal side effects, which can be mitigated. In this review, we present the risks of obesity and benefits of weight loss for women, and summarize clinical development of GLP-1 RAs for weight management. Finally, we provide practical advice and recommendations for OBGYNs to open the discussion about bodyweight with their patients, initiate lifestyle modification and GLP-1 RA treatment, and help them persist with these interventions to achieve optimal weight loss with associated health benefits.",

    "title": "Physiological Responses of Post-Dietary Effects: Lessons from Pre-Clinical and Clinical Studies.",
    "abstract": "Dieting regimens such as calorie restriction (CR) are among the most commonly practiced interventions for weight management and metabolic abnormalities. Due to its independence from pharmacological agents and considerable flexibility in regimens, many individuals turn to dieting as a form of mitigation and maintenance of metabolic health. While metabolic benefits of CR have been widely studied, weight loss maintenance and metabolic benefits are reported to be lost overtime when the diet regimen has been terminated-referred to as post-dietary effects. Specifically, due to the challenges of long-term adherence and compliance to dieting, post-dietary repercussions such as body weight regain and loss of metabolic benefits pose as major factors in the efficacy of CR. Intermittent fasting (IF) regimens, which are defined by periodic energy restriction, have been deemed as more flexible, compliant, and easily adapted diet interventions that result in many metabolic benefits which resemble conventional CR diets. Many individuals find that IF regimens are easier to adhere to, resulting in fewer post-dietary effects; therefore, IF may be a more effective intervention. Unfortunately, there is a severe gap in current research regarding IF post-dietary effects. We recognize the importance of understanding the sustainability of dieting; as such, we will review the known physiological responses of CR post-dietary effects and its potential mechanisms through synthesizing lessons from both pre-clinical and clinical studies. This review aims to provide insight from a translational medicine perspective to allow for the development of more practical and effective diet interventions. We suggest more flexible and easily practiced dieting regimens such as IF due to its more adaptable and practical nature.",

    "abstract": "Weight loss after proper diet is one of the main topics in nutrition. This study was designed to evaluate the effects of probiotic and alpha-Lipoic acid (ALA) supplements on the anthropometric indicators and maintenance of weight in overweight individuals. This study consisted of two phases of weight loss (8 weeks) and weight maintenance (16 weeks). Eighty-eight overweight participants were randomly divided into 4 groups in phase 1: isocaloric diet with probiotic (500 mg), an isocaloric diet with ALA (600 mg) and probiotic, an isocaloric diet with ALA and isocaloric diet with placebo. In phase 2, participants received a normal diet with the mentioned supplements. In the beginning, end of the phase 1, and at the end of phase 2, weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), hip circumference (HC), body fat percentage, and blood pressure (BP) were measured. Also, 10 cc blood samples were taken from subjects to measure C-reactive protein (CRP). Data was analyzed using SPSS software. At the end of the two phases, the differences of changes in the probiotic + ALA group was significant in weight, WC, and CRP factors when compared to the other groups (P < 0.05). Also, at the end of the study, maintain a reduced weight was significantly higher in the probiotic + ALA group than in the other groups (P < 0.05). According to findings, probiotics and ALA supplementation with normal diet help to maintain decreased weight after adhering to a weight loss diet. This may be due to the reduction of inflammation.

    "title": "Perspective: Time-Restricted Eating Compared with Caloric Restriction: Potential Facilitators and Barriers of Long-Term Weight Loss Maintenance.",
    "abstract": "A growing body of literature examines the potential benefits of a time-based diet strategy referred to as time-restricted eating (TRE). TRE, a type of intermittent fasting, restricts the time of eating to a window of 4-12 h/d but allows ad libitum intake during eating windows. Although TRE diets do not overtly attempt to reduce energy intake, preliminary evidence from small studies suggests that TRE can lead to concomitant reduction in total energy, improvements in metabolic health, and weight loss. Unique features of the TRE diet strategy may facilitate adherence and long-term weight loss maintenance. In this Perspective, we explore the potential multilevel (i.e., biological, behavioral, psychosocial, environmental) facilitators and barriers of TRE for long-term weight loss maintenance in comparison with the more commonly used diet strategy, caloric restriction (CR). Compared with CR, TRE may facilitate weight loss maintenance by counteracting physiological adaptations to weight loss (biological), allowing for usual dietary preferences to be maintained (behavioral), preserving executive functioning (psychosocial), and enabling individuals to withstand situational pressures to overeat (environmental). However, TRE may also pose unique barriers to weight loss maintenance, particularly for individuals with poor baseline diet quality, internal or social pressures to eat outside selected windows (e.g., grazers), and competing demands that interfere with the scheduling of eating. Future studies of TRE in free-living individuals should consider the multiple levels of influence impacting long-term adherence and weight loss maintenance. Ultimately, TRE could be one strategy in a toolkit of tailored diet strategies to support metabolic health and weight loss maintenance.",

    "abstract": "Greater sensitivity to food rewards and higher levels of impulsivity (and an interaction between these variables, termed \"reinforcement pathology\") have been associated with obesity in cross-sectional studies. Less is known regarding how these constructs may impact attempts at weight loss or longer-term weight loss maintenance. We provided 75 adults (69%Female, 84%White, age = 50.8y, BMI = 31.2kg/m2) with a 3-month Internet-based weight loss program and assessed weight, food reward sensitivity (via the Power of Food Scale [PFS]), and impulsivity (via Go No-Go [GNG] and Delay Discounting [DD] computer tasks) at baseline and at Months 3, 6, 9, and 12. No additional intervention was provided Months 3-12. Multi-level mixed-effect models were used to examine changes in PFS, GNG, and DD over time and associations between these measures and weight loss/regain. Participants lost 6.0±1.1kg Months 0-3 and regained 2.4±1.1kg Months 3-12. Across time points, higher PFS scores were associated with higher weight, p = .007; however, there were no significant associations between GNG or DD and weight nor between the interactions of PFS and GNG or DD and weight, ps>.05. There were significant decreases from Months 0-3 in PFS, GNG, and DD, ps < .05; however, neither baseline values nor changes were significantly associated with weight change and there were no significant associations between the interactions of PFS and GNG or DD and weight change, ps>.05. Results demonstrated an association between food reward sensitivity and weight. Further, decreases in both food reward sensitivity and impulsivity were observed during an initial weight loss program, but neither baseline levels nor improvements were associated with weight change. Taken together, results suggest that the constructs of food reward sensitivity, impulsivity, and reinforcement pathology may have limited clinical utility within behavioral weight management interventions. Future intervention studies should examine whether food-related impulsivity tasks lead to a similar pattern of results.",

    "abstract": "Little is known about the factors affecting body weight-loss maintenance among postmenopausal women. We thus performed an analysis to identify some sociodemographic, physiological, and behavioral predictors of weight regain in a targeted subpopulation of women who had lost weight 1 year earlier. We also measured how eating behaviors and habits as well as physical activity pattern differ among successful and unsuccessful weight-loss maintainers over the trial. Sixty-four postmenopausal women were followed up for a year after dieting, and the successful and unsuccessful maintainers were identified. The regainers had regained an average of 4.9 kg of their lost body weight, while the maintainers had regained only 1.5 kg. Regainers had fewer years of education and lower initial body weight loss than maintainers. They also showed poor dietary adherence during dieting, and had unhealthy patterns of eating involving the avoidance of breakfast and a lower intake of nuts, seeds, and pulses, and a higher intake of sweets, biscuits, cakes, and pastries over time (excluding the dieting period). All the significant sociodemographic, physiological and behavioral variables differentiating regainers and maintainers before and after dieting were then examined as independent variables in a logistic regression model. The model showed that less weight reduction during dieting, higher disinhibition scores after dieting, and avoidance of breakfast before dieting were significant predictors of body weight regain in postmenopausal women. From a practical point of view, early identification of postmenopausal women who are at risk of regaining lost weight can allow health professionals to create behavioral and dietary supports to help prevent this. A regular schedule of follow-ups over at least the first year should be considered for them-including psychological and dietary intervention, if necessary. Since this sample study included only postmenopausal women, our findings are not generalizable to other populations.",

    "abstract": "The participants' experience of low-energy total diet replacement (TDR) programmes delivered by lay counsellors in the community for the routine treatment of obesity is currently unclear. We interviewed a sample of twelve participants who took part in the Doctor Referral of Overweight People to Low-Energy total diet replacement Treatment (DROPLET) trial and were randomised to the TDR programme. We purposively sampled twelve patients who took part in the DROPLET trial, and conducted in-depth telephone interviews, which were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Interview questions focused on participants' experiences and perceptions of the TDR programme. We conducted a thematic analysis, actively developing themes from the data, and used the one sheet of paper (OSOP) technique to develop higher-level concepts. Nine key themes were identified; Reasons for taking part, Expectations, Support and guidance from the counsellor, Time to build a personal relationship, Following the TDR Programme, Adverse events, Outcomes from the TDR, Weight Loss Maintenance, Recommending TDR to others. The relationship between participants and the counsellor was central to many of the themes. Close relationships with counsellors facilitated TDR adherence through providing one-to-one support (including during difficult times), sharing expert knowledge, and building a close relationship. Adherence was also supported by the rapid weight loss that patients reported experiencing. Overall participants reported positive experiences of the TDR, and emphasised the positive impact on their wellbeing. Patients reported that a TDR programme delivered by lay counsellors in the community was a positive experience and effective in helping them to lose weight. Future trials should consider the central role of the person providing support and advice as a key component in the programme.",

    "abstract": "In mammals, adipose tissue is involved in energy homeostasis regulation. White adipose tissue (WAT) is the major energy storage site for mammals, whereas brown adipose tissue (BAT) is involved in energy expenditure and thermogenesis. The conversion of triglycerides from WAT into fuel provides calories for the body and aids in reducing WAT accumulation, which is considered an effective strategy for weight loss and improving lipid metabolism. Regulation at the transcriptional level can determine the differentiation and transdifferentiation of WAT and BAT; however, post-transcriptional regulation offers an additional level of coordination to this process. Despite the high number of studies investigating the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms of key thermogenesis-regulated genes, the regulatory roles of these genes at the post-transcriptional level remain poorly understood. Therefore, this review summarizes the post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms of key thermogenesis-regulated genes, including splicing, m6A modification, RNA degradation, RNA-binding proteins, and ncRNA regulation of pre-mRNAs of these thermogenic genes.",

As part of this process, thermogenesis, fueled in part by uncoupled mitochondrial respiration, plays a central role in converting calories into thermal energy, thereby preventing their storage as fat. Here, we identify a role for exosome trafficking as an intrinsic regulator of beige adipocyte thermogenesis. Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles that mediate cell-cell and intracellular communication by transporting regulatory cargo, including microRNAs, proteins, and lipids. Using both human cells and mouse models, we show that thermogenic activation of beige adipocytes promotes the rapid release of exosomes enriched in microRNAs known to suppress thermogenic programs. Genetic or pharmacological blockade of exosome secretion attenuates thermogenesis, whereas enhancing exosome release amplifies thermogenic output. Mice deficient in the exosome secretion regulator ",

Heat treatment (HT) has shown various metabolic benefits, but its ability to counteract aging-associated metabolic slowdown remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the impact of whole-body HT on energy metabolism, explore the potential mechanism involving the heat sensor TRPV1, and examine the modulation of gut microbiota. Ten-month-old female C57BL/6 mice on a high-fat (HF) diet (45% calories from fat) were exposed to daily HT in a 40-41°C heat chamber for 30 min, 5 days a week for 6 weeks. Metabolic changes, including core body temperature and lipid metabolism transcription in adipose tissue and liver, were assessed. Human brown adipocytes were used to confirm metabolic effects in vitro. HT significantly reduced serum lactate dehydrogenase levels, indicating mitigation of tissue damage. HT attenuated weight gain, improved insulin sensitivity, and increased beta-oxidation in the liver and brown fat. In thermogenic adipose tissue, HT enhanced TRPV1 and Ca HT attenuates aging- and diet-associated metabolic slowdown by increasing futile calcium cycling, enhancing energy expenditure, and altering gut microbiota in middle-aged female C57BL/6 mice. HT may offer a promising strategy to improve metabolic health, especially in aging populations.",

PPID PPIase activity and C-terminal tetratricopeptide repeats, which show specificity towards TOM70 core and C-tail domains, facilitate OMM insertion. Our results provide an unprecedented role for endoplasmic-reticulum-stress-activated chaperones in controlling energy metabolism through a selective OMM protein insertion mechanism with implications in adaptation to cold temperatures and high-calorie diets.",

    "abstract": "With age, metabolic perturbations accumulate to elevate our obesity burden. While age-onset obesity is mostly driven by a sedentary lifestyle and high calorie intake, genetic and epigenetic factors also play a role. Among these, members of the large histone deacetylase (HDAC) family are of particular importance as key metabolic determinants for healthy ageing, or metabolic dysfunction. Here, we aimed to interrogate the role of class 2 family member HDAC5 in controlling systemic metabolism and age-related obesity under non-obesogenic conditions. Starting at 6 months of age, we observed adult-onset obesity in chow-fed male global HDAC5-KO mice, that was accompanied by marked reductions in adrenergic-stimulated ATP-consuming futile cycles, including BAT activity and UCP1 levels, WAT-lipolysis, skeletal muscle, WAT and liver futile creatine and calcium cycles, and ultimately energy expenditure. Female mice did not differ between genotypes. The lower peripheral sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity in mature male KO mice was linked to higher dopaminergic neuronal activity within the dorsomedial arcuate nucleus (dmARC) and elevated hypothalamic dopamine levels. Mechanistically, we reveal that hypothalamic HDAC5 acts as co-repressor of STAT5b over the control of Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) gene transactivation, which ultimately orchestrates the activity of dmARH dopaminergic neurons and energy metabolism in male mice under non-obesogenic conditions.",

    "abstract": "Adipose tissue, a central player in energy balance, exhibits significant metabolic flexibility that is often compromised in obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Mitochondrial dysfunction within adipocytes leads to inefficient lipid handling and increased oxidative stress, which together promote systemic metabolic disruptions central to obesity and its complications. This review explores the pivotal role that mitochondria play in altering the metabolic functions of the primary adipocyte types, white, brown, and beige, within the context of obesity and T2D. Specifically, in white adipocytes, these dysfunctions contribute to impaired lipid processing and an increased burden of oxidative stress, worsening metabolic disturbances. Conversely, compromised mitochondrial function undermines their thermogenic capabilities, reducing the capacity for optimal energy expenditure in brown adipocytes. Beige adipocytes uniquely combine the functional properties of white and brown adipocytes, maintaining morphological similarities to white adipocytes while possessing the capability to transform into mitochondria-rich, energy-burning cells under appropriate stimuli. Each type of adipocyte displays unique metabolic characteristics, governed by the mitochondrial dynamics specific to each cell type. These distinct mitochondrial metabolic phenotypes are regulated by specialized networks comprising transcription factors, co-activators, and enzymes, which together ensure the precise control of cellular energy processes. Strong evidence has shown impaired adipocyte mitochondrial metabolism and faulty upstream regulators in a causal relationship with obesity-induced T2D. Targeted interventions aimed at improving mitochondrial function in adipocytes offer a promising therapeutic avenue for enhancing systemic macronutrient oxidation, thereby potentially mitigating obesity. Advances in understanding mitochondrial function within adipocytes underscore a pivotal shift in approach to combating obesity and associated comorbidities. Reigniting the burning of calories in adipose tissues, and other important metabolic organs such as the muscle and liver, is crucial given the extensive role of adipose tissue in energy storage and release.",

    "abstract": "Overweight and obesity are major public health concerns, with a sharp increase in prevalence over the last few decades. The primary cause is an imbalance between calorie intake and expenditure due to a rise in calorie-rich processed food and reduced physical activity. Energy balance in humans involves complex processes including thermogenesis, a crucial factor in regulating energy expenditure. In this randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled three-arm three-sequence study, we investigated the efficacy of Capsifen® (CapF), a pungency-masked sustained-intestinal release formulation of red chili extract, on energy expenditure, fat oxidation, and endurance using the Quark C-PET system in healthy overweight participants, with and without exercise. In the study, 105 healthy participants were randomized to receive either placebo, CapF 100 mg/day, or CapF 200 mg/day for 28 days. CapF demonstrated a dose-dependent response to increased energy expenditure and fatty acid oxidation with a concomitant reduction in body weight. Both CapF 100 and CapF 200 also increased the time to exhaustion. These results demonstrate the plausible efficacy of CapF in energy expenditure and physical performance in otherwise healthy adults who have a high body mass index. https://ctri.nic.in/Clinicaltrials/pmaindet2.php?EncHid=MjQzNTg=&Enc=&userName=CTRI/2018/04/013157 dated 04 October 2018.",

    "abstract": "Skin has been shown to be a regulatory hub for energy expenditure and metabolism: mutations of skin lipid metabolism enzymes can change the rate of thermogenesis and susceptibility to diet-induced obesity. However, little is known about the physiological basis for this function. Here we show that the thermal properties of skin are highly reactive to diet: within three days, a high fat diet reduces heat transfer through skin. In contrast, a dietary manipulation that prevents obesity accelerates energy loss through skins. We found that skin was the largest target in a mouse body for dietary fat delivery, and that dietary triglyceride was assimilated both by epidermis and by dermal white adipose tissue. Skin from mice calorie-restricted for 3 weeks did not take up circulating lipids and showed a highly depleted stratum corneum. Dietary triglyceride acyl groups persist in skin for weeks after feeding. Using multi-modal lipid profiling, we have implicated both keratinocytes and sebocytes in the altered lipids which correlate with thermal function. In response to high fat feeding, wax diesters and ceramides accumulate, and triglycerides become more saturated. In contrast, in response to the dramatic loss of adipose tissue that accompanies restriction of the branched chain amino acid isoleucine, skin becomes more heat-permeable, resisting changes induced by Western diet feeding, with a signature of depleted signaling lipids. We propose that skin should be routinely included in physiological studies of lipid metabolism, given the size of the skin lipid reservoir and its adaptable functionality.",

    "abstract": "Uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) has been discovered as a possible target for obesity treatment because of its widespread distribution in the inner mitochondrial membrane of brown adipose tissue (BAT) and high energy expenditure capabilities to burn calories as heat. UCP1 is dormant and does not produce heat without activation as it is inhibited by purine nucleotides. However, activation of UCP1 via either direct interaction with the UCP1 protein, an increase in the expression of UCP1 genes or the physiological production of fatty acids can lead to a rise in the thermogenesis phenomenon. Hence, activation of UCP1 through small molecules of synthetic and natural origin can be considered as a promising strategy to mitigate obesity.",

    "abstract": "The functional state of adipocytes plays a central role in regulating numerous important metabolic functions, including energy and glucose homeostasis. While white adipocytes store excess calories as fat (triglycerides) and release free fatty acids as a fuel source in times of need, brown and beige adipocytes (so-called thermogenic adipocytes) convert chemical energy stored in substrates (e.g., fatty acids or glucose) into heat, thus promoting energy expenditure. Like all other cell types, adipocytes express many G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that are linked to four major functional classes of heterotrimeric G proteins (Gs, Gi/o, Gq/11, and G12/13). During the past few years, novel experimental approaches, including the use of chemogenetic strategies, have led to a series of important new findings regarding the metabolic consequences of activating or inhibiting distinct GPCR/G protein signaling pathways in white, brown, and beige adipocytes. This novel information should guide the development of novel drugs capable of modulating the activity of specific adipocyte GPCR signaling pathways for the treatment of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and related metabolic disorders.",

Independent of diets and housing temperatures, TcMAC21 mice consume more calories, are hyperactive and hypermetabolic, remain consistently lean and profoundly insulin sensitive, and have a higher body temperature.

    "title": "Altered motivation states for physical activity and 'appetite' for movement as compensatory mechanisms limiting the efficacy of exercise training for weight loss.",
    "abstract": "Weight loss is a major motive for engaging in exercise, despite substantial evidence that exercise training results in compensatory responses that inhibit significant weight loss. According to the Laws of Thermodynamics and the CICO (Calories in, Calories out) model, increased exercise-induced energy expenditure (EE), in the absence of any compensatory increase in energy intake, should result in an energy deficit leading to reductions of body mass. However, the expected negative energy balance is met with both volitional and non-volitional (metabolic and behavioral) compensatory responses. A commonly reported compensatory response to exercise is increased food intake (i.e., Calories in) due to increased hunger, increased desire for certain foods, and/or changes in health beliefs. On the other side of the CICO model, exercise training can instigate compensatory reductions in EE that resist the maintenance of an energy deficit. This may be due to decreases in non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT), increases in sedentary behavior, or alterations in sleep. Related to this EE compensation, the motivational states associated with the desire to be active tend to be overlooked when considering compensatory changes in non-exercise activity. For example, exercise-induced alterations in the wanting of physical activity could be a mechanism promoting compensatory reductions in EE. Thus, one's desires, urges or cravings for movement-also known as \"motivation states\" or \"appetence for activity\"-are thought to be proximal instigators of movement. Motivation states for activity may be influenced by genetic, metabolic, and psychological drives for activity (and inactivity), and such states are susceptible to fatigue-or reward-induced responses, which may account for reductions in NEAT in response to exercise training. Further, although the current data are limited, recent investigations have demonstrated that motivation states for physical activity are dampened by exercise and increase after periods of sedentarism. Collectively, this evidence points to additional compensatory mechanisms, associated with motivational states, by which impositions in exercise-induced changes in energy balance may be met with resistance, thus resulting in attenuated weight loss.",

Here, we used C57BL/6J mice to establish animal models of high-fat diet (HFD) induced obesity sensitive (DIO) mice and obesity resistant (DIR) mice. In DIR mice, improved metabolic profile through brown adipose tissue (BAT) activation was observed, while plasma unconjugated bile acids (BAs) were decreased together with increased intestine tauro-conjugated BAs (e.g., T-β-MCA). The composition of the gut flora also differs greatly between DIR and DOR. Using fecal microbiota transplants from DIR mice, HFD fed recipient mice exhibited a trend toward reduced adiposity and improved glucose tolerance, showing increased serum tauro-conjugated BAs levels. STC-1 cell experiments confirmed T-β-MCA could activate FXR/TGR5 pathway and induce the production of GLP-1, inhibiting genes that regulate the ceramide synthesis. Our results indicated that the DIR mice exhibited higher energy expenditure by activating BAT thermogenesis, which may be related to altered gut microbiota-bile acids-glucagon like peptide-1 axis.",

    "abstract": "The endocannabinoid system (ECS) increases food intake, appetite for fat and lipogenesis, while decreases energy expenditure (thermogenesis), contributing to metabolic dysfunctions. We demonstrated that maternal high-fat diet (HFD) alters cannabinoid signaling in brown adipose tissue (BAT) of neonate and weanling male rat offspring, which have increased adiposity but also higher energy expenditure in adulthood. In this study, the main objective was to investigate the ECS expression in thermogenic tissues as BAT and skeletal muscle of adult rats programmed by maternal HFD. We hypothesized that maternal HFD would modulate ECS and energy metabolism markers in BAT and skeletal muscle of adult male offspring. Female rats received standard diet (9.4 % of calories as fat) or isocaloric HFD (28.9 % of calories as fat) for 8 weeks premating and throughout gestation and lactation. Male offspring were weaned on standard diet and euthanatized in adulthood. Maternal HFD increased body weight, adiposity, glycemia, leptinemia while decreased testosterone levels in adult offspring. Maternal HFD did not change cannabinoid receptors in BAT or skeletal muscle as hypothesized but increased the content of uncoupling protein and tyrosine hydroxylase (thermogenic markers) in parallel to changes in mitochondrial morphology in skeletal muscle of adult offspring. In metabolic programming models, the ECS modulation in the BAT and skeletal muscle may be more important early in life to adapt energy metabolism during maternal dietary insult, and other mechanisms are possibly involved in muscle metabolism long-term regulation.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is a growing problem for public health worldwide. Calorie restriction (CR) is a safety and effective life intervention to defend against obesity. Short-term moderate CR may be a more favorable strategy against this pathology. However, the mechanisms behind the effects of CR remain to be clarified. Increased energy expenditure in the liver and brown adipose tissue could potentially be manipulated to modulate and improve metabolism in obesity. Moreover, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-dependent deacetylase sirtuin-1 (SIRT1) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) are well-characterized metabolic modulators. We aim to explore the anti-obesity effects of short-term moderate CR by improving energy metabolism via the SIRT1/AMPK pathway in white adipocytes and liver in a mouse model of obesity. Male C57BL/6 mice were randomized into two groups receiving either a standard or a high-fat diet (HFD) for 8 weeks to induce obesity. The HFD-induced obese mice were further randomized into two groups: HFD group or CR group (received 75% of the food eaten by HFD group). Their energy metabolism, white adipose tissue (WAT) contents, hepatic fat deposition, the expression of AMPK, SIRT1, peroxisome proliferators γ-activated receptor coactivator-1α (PGC-1α), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in WAT, and hepatic tissues were determined. After 4 weeks, body weight, total serum cholesterol, fasting blood glucose, and insulin levels were significantly lower in the CR group. Moreover, CR ameliorated hepatocyte steatosis, attenuated white adipogenesis, and increased energy expenditure and expressions of SIRT1, PGC-1α, and phosphorylated AMPK in subcutaneous WAT and the hepatic tissues. In addition, CR reduced the protein levels of NF-κB and increased the eNOS expression. Short-term moderate CR decreases obesity, increases the thermogenesis, and inhibits inflammation in a mouse model of obesity, probably via the activation of the AMPK/SIRT1 pathway in WAT and liver.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is a widespread public health problem with profound medical consequences and its burden is increasing worldwide. Obesity causes significant morbidity and mortality and is associated with conditions including cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus. Conventional treatment options are insufficient, or in the case of bariatric surgery, quite invasive. The etiology of obesity is complex, but at its core is often a caloric imbalance with an inability to burn off enough calories to exceed caloric intake, resulting in storage. Interventions such as dieting often lead to decreased resting energy expenditure (REE), with a rebound in weight (\"yo-yo effect\" or weight cycling). Strategies that increase REE are attractive treatment options. Brown fat tissue engages in nonshivering thermogenesis whereby mitochondrial respiration is uncoupled from ATP production, increasing REE. Medications that replicate brown fat metabolism by mitochondrial uncoupling (e.g., 2,4-dinitrophenol) effectively promote weight loss but are limited by toxicity to a narrow therapeutic range. This review explores the possibility of a new therapeutic approach to engineer autologous T cells into acquiring a thermogenic phenotype like brown fat. Engineered autologous T cells have been used successfully for years in the treatment of cancers (chimeric antigen receptor T cells), and the principle of engineering T cells ex vivo and transferring them back to the patient is established. Engineering T cells to acquire a brown fat-like metabolism could increase REE without the risks of pharmacological mitochondrial uncoupling. These thermogenic T cells may increase basal metabolic rate and are therefore a potentially novel therapeutic strategy for obesity.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic syndrome (MS) is a complex pathology characterized by visceral adiposity, insulin resistance, arterial hypertension, and dyslipidaemia. It has become a global epidemic associated with increased consumption of high-calorie, low-fibre food and sedentary habits. Some of its underlying mechanisms have been identified, with hypoadiponectinemia, inflammation and oxidative stress as important factors for MS establishment and progression. Alterations in adipokine levels may favour glucotoxicity and lipotoxicity which, in turn, contribute to inflammation and cellular stress responses within the adipose, pancreatic and liver tissues, in addition to hepatic steatosis. The multiple mechanisms of MS make its clinical management difficult, involving both non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions. Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels are non-selective calcium channels involved in a plethora of physiological events, including energy balance, inflammation and oxidative stress. Evidence from animal models of disease has contributed to identify their specific contributions to MS and may help to tailor clinical trials for the disease. In this context, the oxidative stress sensors TRPV1, TRPA1 and TRPC5, play major roles in regulating inflammatory responses, thermogenesis and energy expenditure. Here, the interplay between these TRP channels and oxidative stress in MS is discussed in the light of novel therapies to treat this syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is a chronic condition of multifactorial etiology characterized by excessive body fat due to a calorie intake higher than energy expenditure. Given the intrinsic limitations of surgical interventions and the difficulties associated with lifestyle changes, pharmacological manipulation is currently one of the main therapies for metabolic diseases. Approaches aiming to promote energy expenditure through induction of thermogenesis have been explored and, in this context, brown adipose tissue (BAT) activation and browning have been shown to be promising strategies. Although such processes are physiologically stimulated by the sympathetic nervous system, not all situations that are known to increase adrenergic signaling promote a concomitant increase in BAT activation or browning in humans. Thus, a better understanding of factors involved in the thermogenesis attributed to these tissues is needed to enable the development of future therapies against obesity. Herein we carry out a critical review of original articles in humans under conditions previously known to trigger adrenergic responses-namely, cold, catecholamine-secreting tumor (pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma), burn injury, and adrenergic agonists-and discuss which of them are associated with increased BAT activation and browning. BAT is clearly stimulated in individuals exposed to cold or treated with high doses of the β3-adrenergic agonist mirabegron, whereas browning is certainly induced in patients after burn injury or with pheochromocytoma, as well as in individuals treated with β3-adrenergic agonist mirabegron for at least 10 weeks. Given the potential effect of increasing energy expenditure, adrenergic stimuli are promising strategies in the treatment of metabolic diseases.",

The ingestion of a milk fat globule membrane (MFGM) supplement and a high calorie diet are reported gateways into BAT activation. However, little is known about the effect of the MFGM and high calorie diets on BAT volume. To gain insight into this, mice were maintained on a high-fat (HF) or low-fat (LF) diet in conjunction with either full-cream (FC) or skim bovine dairy milk (BDM). After being maintained on their respective diets for 13 weeks, their body composition, including BAT volume, was measured using X-ray microtomography. A high calorie diet resulted in an increase in the BAT volume and mice consuming an HF diet in conjunction with FC BDM had a significantly greater BAT volume than all the other groups. Conversely, mice consuming an HF diet in addition to skim milk had a lower BAT volume compared to the HF control. The data presented suggest that the consumption of a high calorie diet in conjunction with FC BDM increases the BAT volume in wild-type mice. This study may provide valuable insight into future studies investigating BAT volume and BAT activity in relation to environmental factors, including diet.",

    "title": "The Mystery of Energy Compensation.",
    "abstract": "AbstractThe received wisdom on how activity affects energy expenditure is that the more activity is undertaken, the more calories will have been burned by the end of the day. Yet traditional hunter-gatherers, who lead physically hard lives, burn no more calories each day than Western populations living in labor-saving environments. Indeed, there is now a wealth of data, both for humans and other animals, demonstrating that long-term lifestyle changes involving increases in exercise or other physical activities do not result in commensurate increases in daily energy expenditure (DEE). This is because humans and other animals exhibit a degree of energy compensation at the organismal level, ameliorating some of the increases in DEE that would occur from the increased activity by decreasing the energy expended on other biological processes. And energy compensation can be sizable, reaching many hundreds of calories in humans. But the processes that are downregulated in the long-term to achieve energy compensation are far from clear, particularly in humans-we do not know how energy compensation is achieved. My review here of the literature on relevant exercise intervention studies, for both humans and other species, indicates conflict regarding the role, if any, of basal metabolic rate (BMR) or low-level activity such as fidgeting play, particularly once changes in body composition are factored out. In situations where BMR and low-level activity are not major components of energy compensation, what then drives it? I discuss how changes in mitochondrial efficiency and changes in circadian fluctuations in BMR may contribute to our understanding of energy management. Currently unexplored, these mechanisms and others may provide important insights into the mystery of how energy compensation is achieved.",

    "abstract": "Thermogenesis (non-exercise activity) in brown adipose tissue (BAT) promotes energy expenditure because of its higher number of mitochondria than white adipose tissue (WAT). The main function of thermogenesis in BAT can counteract obesity through the dissipation of calories as heat. N-butylidenephthalide (BP) is a natural derivative from Angelica sinensis, a Chinese herb that has been used for thousands of years. In this report, we demonstrated that BP improved the metabolic profiles of mice with high fat diet-induced obesity (DIO) by preventing weight gain, improving serum blood parameters, enhancing energy expenditure, stimulating white fat browning, and reversing hepatic steatosis. Further investigations demonstrated that BP administration upregulated the mRNA expression of beige (CD137, TMEM26) and brown fat selected genes (UCP1, PRDM16, PGC-1α, PPARγ) in white adipose tissues. In vitro studies, BP treatment increased multilocular lipid droplet levels, induced β-adrenergic receptor (cAMP/PKA) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling (AMPK/acetyl-CoA carboxylase/SIRT1), and increased oxygen consumption in murine differentiated beige adipocytes, and the effects of BP were blocked by an AMPK inhibitor. BP promoted the interaction of AMPK with PGC-1α in beige adipocytes. Our findings provide novel insights into the application of BP in regulating energy metabolism and suggest its utility for clinical use in the treatment of obesity and related diseases.",

    "abstract": "Targeted temperature management (TTM) directly impacts energy expenditure via temperature modulation and shivering associated with temperature modulating devices. We hypothesized that resting energy expenditure (REE) can be accurately estimated utilizing data obtained from a surface gel pad temperature modulating device (TMD) and demographic factors. Baseline demographic data, along with concurrent temperature, sedation, and shivering data, and indirect calorimetry (IDC) were collected from patients undergoing TTM. The data from the IDC and temperature modulation device (TMD) were synchronized and averaged over 60-second intervals to provide simultaneous comparisons. Heat transfer (calories) was calculated from the TMD by an equation that assessed water temperature from the TMD to the patient, water temperature returning to the TMD, water flow rates, and device mode. A linear regression model was used to determine factors associated with REE as measured by IDC. A difference in the mean between REE and estimated REE was used to assess accuracy. There were 48 assessments conducted in 40 subjects [mean (standard deviation)] age: 58 (14) years, 60% female, body surface area (BSA): 2.0 ± 0.3 who underwent simultaneous assessments. Target temperature was 36-37°C in 75%, with a median Bedside Shivering Assessment Score of 0 (range 0-2). Factors associated with REE on multivariable linear regression included older age (",

    "abstract": "The recent identification of brown adipose tissue in adult humans offers a new strategy to increase energy expenditure to treat obesity and associated metabolic disease. While white adipose tissue (WAT) is primarily for energy storage, brown adipose tissue (BAT) is a thermogenic organ that increases energy expenditure to generate heat. BAT is activated upon cold exposure and improves insulin sensitivity and lipid clearance, highlighting its beneficial role in metabolic health in humans. This review provides an overview of BAT physiology in conditions of overnutrition (obesity and associated metabolic disease), undernutrition and in conditions of altered fat distribution such as lipodystrophy. We review the impact of exercise, dietary macronutrients and bioactive compounds on BAT activity. Finally, we discuss the therapeutic potential of dietary manipulations or supplementation to increase energy expenditure and BAT thermogenesis. We conclude that chronic nutritional interventions may represent a useful nonpharmacological means to enhance BAT mass and activity to aid weight loss and/or improve metabolic health.",

    "abstract": "Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is well known to burn calories through uncoupled respiration, producing heat to maintain body temperature. This 'calorie wasting' feature makes BAT a special tissue, which can function as an 'energy sink' in mammals. While a combination of high energy intake and low energy expenditure is the leading cause of overweight and obesity in modern society, activating a safe 'energy sink' has been proposed as a promising obesity treatment strategy. Metabolically, lipids and glucose have been viewed as the major energy substrates in BAT, while succinate, lactate, branched-chain amino acids, and other metabolites can also serve as energy substrates for thermogenesis. Since the cataplerotic and anaplerotic reactions of these metabolites interconnect with each other, BAT relies on its dynamic, flexible, and complex metabolism to support its special function. In this review, we summarize how BAT orchestrates the metabolic utilization of various nutrients to support thermogenesis and contributes to whole-body metabolic homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "Several clinical trials have found that consuming more protein than the recommended dietary allowance not only reduces body weight (BW), but also enhances body composition by decreasing fat mass while preserving fat-free mass (FFM) in both low-calorie and standard-calorie diets. Fairly long-term clinical trials of 6-12 months reported that a high-protein diet (HPD) provides weight-loss effects and can prevent weight regain after weight loss. HPD has not been reported to have adverse effects on health in terms of bone density or renal function in healthy adults. Among gut-derived hormones, glucagon-like peptide-1, cholecystokinin, and peptide tyrosine-tyrosine reduce appetite, while ghrelin enhances appetite. HPD increases these anorexigenic hormone levels while decreasing orexigenic hormone levels, resulting in increased satiety signaling and, eventually, reduced food intake. Additionally, elevated diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT), increased blood amino acid concentration, increased hepatic gluconeogenesis, and increased ketogenesis caused by higher dietary protein contribute to increased satiety. The mechanism by which HPD increases energy expenditure involves two aspects: first, proteins have a markedly higher DIT than carbohydrates and fats. Second, protein intake prevents a decrease in FFM, which helps maintain resting energy expenditure despite weight loss. In conclusion, HPD is an effective and safe tool for weight reduction that can prevent obesity and obesity-related diseases. However, long-term clinical trials spanning more than 12 months should be conducted to further substantiate HPD effects.",

    "abstract": "Decreases in energy stores requires negative energy balance where caloric expenditure exceeds energy intake, which can induce adaptive thermogenesis-the reduction of energy expenditure (EE) beyond that accounted for by the weight lost. Adaptive thermogenesis varies between individuals.

Total daily EE and physical activity were examined before and after 21 days of 50% calorie restriction in male and female rats with lean and obesity-prone phenotypes-rats selectively bred for high and low intrinsic aerobic capacity (HCR and LCR, respectively). Calorie restriction significantly decreased EE more than was predicted by loss of weight and lean mass, demonstrating adaptive thermogenesis. Within sex, HCR and LCR did not significantly differ in resting EE. However, the calorie restriction-induced suppression in non-resting EE, which includes activity EE, was significantly greater in HCR than in LCR; this phenotypic difference was significant for both male and female rats.

Promoting thermogenesis via increasing the function of brown adipose tissue (BAT) or white adipose tissue (WAT) browning has been proposed as a new protective approach against obesity. The goal of this study was to evaluate the effects of Royal Jelly (RJ) and tocotrienol rich fraction (TRF) on BAT activation and WAT browning during calorie restriction diet (CRD) in obesity model. In this experimental study, 50 obese Wistar rats were randomly divided into 5 groups and then received one of the following treatments for a period of 8-week: High-fat diet (HFD), CRD, RJ + CRD, TRF + CRD, and RJ + TRF + CRD. Effects of RJ and TRF, individually and in combination on body weight and the expression of key thermoregulatory genes in WAT and BAT were examined by quantitative real-time (qRT-PCR). Also, morphological alterations were assessed by hematoxylin and eosin staining. RJ (- 67.21 g ±4.84 g) and RJ + TRF (- 73.29 g ±4.51 g) significantly reduced weight gain relative to the CRD group (- 40.70 g ±6.50 g,  Our results suggest that, Royal Jelly promotes thermogenesis and browning of WAT, contributing to an increase in energy expenditure. Thus, Royal Jelly may give rise to a novel dietary choice to attenuate obesity.",

The finding of the secretin-induced gut-brown fat-brain axis creates new opportunities to manipulate brown fat and thereby energy balance in a natural way while living in a thermoneutral environment.

    "abstract": "Calorie restriction (CR) is the most potent, non-pharmacological intervention to support metabolic health. The effects of calorie restriction exceed weight loss. Consistent throughout many studies, calorie restriction induces a reduction in energy expenditure that is larger than the loss of metabolic mass, i.e. fat-free mass and fat mass, can explain. Per prevailing theories of mammalian aging, this disproportionate reduction in metabolic rate, defined as metabolic adaptation, reduces oxidative damage and thereby delays age-associated declines in physiological function. The aim of this narrative review is to investigate the origins of CR-induced metabolic adaptation. From a physiological standpoint this likely relates to the composition of body weight loss, reductions in insulin secretion, thyroid and leptin concentrations, and increased mitochondrial energy efficiency. Behavioral factors including physical activity and eating behaviors likely also play a role, specifically to prevent weight regain. Future studies are required to understand the interindividual differences in the response to CR, e.g. by sex, physical activity, or mitochondrial capacity, and to assess the long-term implications of CR for weight regain.",

Factors that increase DIT are expected to lower body mass index and body fat mass. Although various methods have been developed for measuring DIT in humans, there is currently no method available for calculating absolute DIT values in mice. Therefore, we attempted to measure DIT in mice by applying the method more commonly used for humans. Mouse energy metabolism was first measured under fasting conditions; EE was plotted against the square root of the activity count, and a linear regression equation was fit to the data. Then, energy metabolism was measured in mice that were allowed to feed ad libitum, and EE was plotted in the same way. We calculated the DIT by subtracting the predicted EE value from the fed EE value for the same activity count. The methodology for measuring DIT in mice may be helpful for researching ways of combatting obesity by increasing DIT. •The methodology for measuring absolute DIT values in mice is developed.•For mice, the proportion of DIT compared with calorie intake and EE are 12.3% and 21.7%, respectively.",

    "title": "Low-Protein Diets with Fixed Carbohydrate Content Promote Hyperphagia and Sympathetically Mediated Increase in Energy Expenditure.",
    "abstract": "Dietary protein restriction elicits hyperphagia and increases energy expenditure; however, less is known of whether these responses are a consequence of increasing carbohydrate content. The effects of protein-diluted diets with fixed carbohydrate content on energy balance, hormones, and key markers of protein sensing and thermogenesis in tissues are determined. Obesity-prone rats (n = 13-16 per group) are randomized to diets containing fixed carbohydrate (52% calories) and varying protein concentrations: 15% (control), 10% (mild protein restriction), 5% (moderate protein restriction) or 1% (severe protein restriction) protein calories, or protein-matched to 5% protein, for 21 days. Propranolol and ondansetron are administered to interrogate the roles of sympathetic and serotonergic systems, respectively, in diet-induced changes in energy expenditure. It is found that mild-to-moderate protein restriction promotes transient hyperphagia, whereas severe protein restriction induces hypophagia, with alterations in meal patterns. Protein restriction enhances energy expenditure that is partly attenuated by propranolol, but not ondansetron. Moderate to severe protein restriction decreases gains in body weight, lean and fat mass, decreased postprandial glucose and leptin, but increased fibroblast growth factor-21 concentrations. Protein-matching retains lean mass suggesting that intake of dietary protein, but not calories, is important for preserving lean mass. Notably, protein restriction increases the protein and/or transcript abundance of key amino acid sensing molecules in liver and intestine (PERK, eIF2α, ATF2, CHOP, 4EBP1, FGF21), and upregulated thermogenic markers (β2AR, Klotho, HADH, UCP-1) in brown adipose tissue. Low-protein diets promote hyperphagia and sympathetically mediated increase in energy expenditure, prevent gains in tissue reserves, and concurrently upregulate hepatic and intestinal amino acid sensing intermediaries and thermogenic markers in brown adipose tissue.",

    "abstract": "Elimination of food calories as heat could help redress the excess accumulation of metabolic energy exhibited as obesity. Prior studies have focused on the induction of thermogenesis in beige and brown adipose tissues as the application of this principle, particularly because the β-adrenergic environment associated with thermogenic activation has been shown to have positive health implications. The counterpoint to this strategy is the regulation of heat loss; we propose that mammals with inefficient heat conservation will require more thermogenesis to maintain body temperature. Surface temperature thermography and rates of trans-epidermal water loss were integrated to profile the total heat transfer of genetically-engineered and genetically variable mice. These data were incorporated with energy expenditure data to generate a biophysical profile to test the significance of increased rates of evaporative cooling. We show that mouse skins vary considerably in their heat retention properties, whether because of naturally occurring variation (SKH-1 mice), or genetic modification of the heat-retaining lipid lamellae (SCD1, DGAT1 or Agouti A",

    "abstract": "Greater increase in 24-h energy expenditure (24EE) during overfeeding and smaller decrease in 24EE during fasting (\"spendthrift\" metabolic phenotype) are associated with more weight loss during sustained caloric restriction in overweight subjects. The aim of this study was to investigate whether these acute metabolic responses can also predict weight gain during sustained overfeeding in lean individuals. Seven lean men participated in this study. Prior to overfeeding, 24EE responses to fasting and 200% normal-protein overfeeding were measured in a whole-room indirect calorimeter. Volunteers underwent 6 wk of 150% low-protein (2%) overfeeding followed by another wk of weight-maintaining diet, during which 24EE was revaluated. Body composition, 24EE, and various hormone concentrations, including fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), were assessed at baseline, at wk 1, 3, and 6 of the overfeeding period, and 1 wk following overfeeding through the use of dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, indirect calorimetry, and ELISA. Cumulative energy surplus was calculated from 24EE, daily physical activity, and direct measurements of calories of nutrient intake, feces, and urine by bomb calorimetry. The average weight gain during 6 wk of low-protein overfeeding was 3.8 kg (6.1%, min: +2.5%, max: +8.0%). During 24-h fasting at baseline, 24EE decreased on average (mean ± SD) by 158 ± 81 kcal/d (P = 0.007). Subjects with less 24EE decrease during fasting (more metabolically spendthrift individuals) gained less weight (r = -0.84, P = 0.03), less fat mass (r = -0.81, P = 0.049), and stored less calories (r = -0.91, P = 0.03) during overfeeding. Following overfeeding, increased 24EE above requirements for achieved body size was associated with less weight and fat mass gain (r = -0.78, P = 0.04) and with the increase in 24EE during 200% normal-protein overfeeding measured at baseline (r = 0.91, P = 0.005). Serum FGF21 concentrations increased up to 44-fold during overfeeding (P <  0.0001). Low-protein overfeeding may be an important tool to identify metabolic phenotypes (spendthrift compared with thrifty) that characterize susceptibility to weight gain. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00687115.",

    "title": "Dynamic Energy Balance and Obesity Prevention.",
    "abstract": "Dynamic energy balance can give clinicians important answers for why obesity is so resistant to control. When food intake is reduced for weight control, all components of energy expenditure change, including metabolic rate at rest (resting energy expenditure [REE]), metabolic rate of exercise, and adaptive thermogenesis. This means that a change in energy intake influences energy expenditure in a dynamic way. Mechanisms associated with reduction of total energy expenditure following weight loss are likely to be related to decreased body mass and enhanced metabolic efficiency. Reducing calorie intake results in a decrease in body weight, initially with a marked reduction in fat free mass and a decrease in REE, and this change is maintained for several years in a reduced state. Metabolic adaptation, which is not explained by changes in body composition, lasts for more than several years. These are powerful physiological adaptations that induce weight regain. To avoid a typically observed weight-loss and regain trajectory, realistic weight loss goals should be established and maintained for more than 1 year. Using a mathematical model can help clinicians formulate advice about diet control. It is important to emphasize steady efforts for several years to maintain reduced weight over efforts to lose weight. Because obesity is difficult to reverse, clinicians must prioritize obesity prevention. Obesity prevention strategies should have high feasibility, broad population reach, and relatively low cost, especially for young children who have the smallest energy gaps to change.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic syndromes are prevalent worldwide and result in various complications including obesity, cardiovascular disease and type II diabetes. Betulinic acid (BA) is a naturally occurring triterpenoid that has anti-inflammatory properties. We hypothesized that treatment with BA may result in decreased body weight gain, adiposity and hepatic steatosis in a diet-induced mouse model of obesity. Mice fed a high-fat diet and treated with BA showed less weight gain and tissue adiposity without any change in calorie intake. Gene expression profiling of mouse tissues and cell lines revealed that BA treatment increased expression of lipid oxidative genes and decreased that of lipogenesis-related genes. This modulation was mediated by increased AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation, which facilitates energy expenditure, lipid oxidation and thermogenic capacity and exerts protective effects against obesity and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Overall, BA markedly inhibited the development of obesity and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in mice fed a high-fat diet, and AMPK activation in various tissues and enhanced thermogenesis are two possible mechanisms underlying the antiobesity and antisteatogenic effects of BA. The current findings suggest that treatment with BA is a potential dietary strategy for preventing obesity and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.",

    "abstract": "High protein diets have become popular for body weight maintenance and weight loss despite controversies regarding efficacy and safety. Although both weight gain and weight loss are determined by energy consumption and expenditure, data from rodent trials consistently demonstrate that the protein:carbohydrate ratio in high fat diets strongly influences body and fat mass gain per calorie eaten. Here, we review data from rodent trials examining how high protein diets may modulate energy metabolism and the mechanisms by which energy may be dissipated. We discuss the possible role of activating brown and so-called beige/BRITE adipocytes including non-canonical UCP1-independent thermogenesis and futile cycles, where two opposing metabolic pathways are operating simultaneously. We further review data on how the gut microbiota may affect energy expenditure. Results from human and rodent trials demonstrate that human trials are less consistent than rodent trials, where casein is used almost exclusively as the protein source. The lack of consistency in results from human trials may relate to the specific design of human trials, the possible distinct impact of different protein sources, and/or the differences in the efficiency of high protein diets to attenuate obesity development in lean subjects vs. promoting weight loss in obese subjects.",

It has been suggested that different nutrition formulas may beneficially influence glucose levels in surgical intensive care patients. In this prospective randomized clinical cohort study we investigated glucose homeostasis in response to different enteral nutrition formulas in medical critically ill patients. 60 medical critically ill patients were randomized to receive continuous fat-based (group A, n = 30) or glucose-based enteral nutrition (group B, n = 30) for seven days. Indirect calorimetry was performed to determine energy demand at baseline and on days 3 and 7. Glucose levels and area under the curve (AUC), insulin demand, glucose variability, and calorie and substrate intake per 24 h were assessed for 7 days. Over the course of 7 days patients had similar average daily glucose (p = 0.655), glucose AUC (A: 758 (641-829) mg/dl/day vs B: 780 (733-845) mg/dl/day, p = 0.283), similar overall insulin demand (A: 153.5 (45.3-281.5) IE vs B: 167.9 (82.3-283.8) IE, p = 0.525), and received similar amounts of enteral nutrition per 24 h.

    "abstract": "Diet-induced thermogenesis is an important homeostatic mechanism that limits weight gain in response to caloric excess and contributes to the relative stability of body weight in most individuals. We previously demonstrated that creatine enhances energy expenditure through stimulation of mitochondrial ATP turnover, but the physiological role and importance of creatine energetics in adipose tissue have not been explored. Here, we have inactivated the first and rate-limiting enzyme of creatine biosynthesis, glycine amidinotransferase (GATM), selectively in fat (Adipo-Gatm KO). Adipo-Gatm KO mice are prone to diet-induced obesity due to the suppression of elevated energy expenditure that occurs in response to high-calorie feeding. This is paralleled by a blunted capacity for β3-adrenergic activation of metabolic rate, which is rescued by dietary creatine supplementation. These results provide strong in vivo genetic support for a role of GATM and creatine metabolism in energy expenditure, diet-induced thermogenesis, and defense against diet-induced obesity.",

    "abstract": "The macronutrient composition of the diet may play a more important role in maintaining a healthy body weight and preventing obesity than previously thought. The primary goal of this research was to determine the extent to which the simple addition of a small serving of a sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) to meals with different macronutrient compositions impacts appetite, energy metabolism and substrate oxidation. Appetite, energy metabolism and substrate oxidation were measured in 27 healthy weight adults (age = 23 ± 5 y; BMI = 23 ± 2 kg/m Increasing dietary protein decreased hunger and increased satiety. Males were hungrier and less satisfied with the meals than females. Increasing dietary protein also decreased the desire to eat something savory, salty and fatty and the males had a greater appetite for food with these taste profiles. Interestingly, there was no effect of sex, dietary protein or beverage type on the desire to eat something sweet. The inclusion of a SSB markedly suppressed DIT (2.42% ± 5.91%) and fat oxidation (9.87 ± 11.09 g). Appetite sensations, food preferences, energy expenditure and substrate oxidation are significantly altered in response to changes in meal macronutrient composition produced by modifications in the protein content of a meal and consumption of a SSB. Most notably, consumption of a SSB during a meal markedly reduces energy efficiency and fat oxidation independent of macronutrient composition.

    "abstract": "Overweight and obesity result from an imbalance between caloric intake and energy expenditure, including expenditure from spontaneous physical activity (SPA). Changes in SPA and resulting changes in non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT) likely interact with diet to influence risk for obesity. However, previous research on the relationship between diet, physical activity, and energy expenditure has been mixed. The neuropeptide orexin is a driver of SPA, and orexin neuron activity can be manipulated using DREADDs (Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs). We hypothesized that HFD decreases SPA and NEAT, and that DREADD-mediated activation of orexin neuron signaling would abolish this decrease and produce an increase in NEAT instead. To test these ideas, we characterized behaviors to determine the extent to which access to a high-fat diet (HFD) influences the proportion and probability of engaging in food intake and activity. We then measured NEAT following access to HFD and following a DREADD intervention targeting orexin neurons. Two cohorts of orexin-cre male mice were injected with an excitatory DREADD virus into the caudal hypothalamus, where orexin neurons are concentrated. Mice were then housed in continuous metabolic phenotyping cages (Sable Promethion). Food intake, indirect calorimetry, and SPA were automatically measured every second. For cohort 1 (n=8), animals were given access to chow, then switched to HFD. For cohort 2 (n=4/group), half of the animals were given access to HFD, the other access to chow. Then, among animals on HFD, orexin neurons were activated following injections of clozapine n-oxide (CNO). Mice on HFD spent significantly less time eating (p<0.01) and more time inactive compared to mice on chow (p<0.01). Following a meal, mice on HFD were significantly more likely to engage in periods of inactivity compared to those on chow (p<0.05). NEAT was decreased in animals on HFD, and was increased to the NEAT level of control animals following activation of orexin neurons with DREADDs. Food intake (kilocalories) was not significantly different between mice on chow and HFD, yet mice on chow expended more energy per unit of SPA, relative to that in mice consuming HFD. These results suggest that HFD consumption reduces SPA and NEAT, and increases inactivity following a meal. Together, the data suggest a change in the efficiency of energy expenditure based upon diet, such that SPA during HFD burns fewer calories compared to SPA on a standard chow diet.",

Prolonged food restriction resulted in a 42% reduction in daily EE, through a 40% decrease in resting EE, and a 48% decline in nonresting EE These decreases in EE were significant even when the reductions in body weight and lean mass were taken into account. Along with a decreased caloric need for low-to-moderate-intensity treadmill activity with 50% CR, baseline and activity-related muscle thermogenesis were also suppressed, though the ability to increase muscle thermogenesis above baseline levels was not compromised. When sympathetic drive was measured by assessing norepinephrine turnover (NETO), 50% CR was found to decrease NETO in three of the four muscle groups examined, whereas elevated NETO was found in white adipose tissue of food-restricted rats. Central activation of melanocortin 4 receptors in the ventromedial hypothalamus stimulated this pathway, enhancing activity EE; this was not compromised by 50% CR These data suggest that suppressed activity EE contributes to adaptive thermogenesis during energy restriction. This may stem from decreased sympathetic drive to skeletal muscle, increasing locomotor efficiency and reducing skeletal muscle thermogenesis. The capacity to increase activity EE in response to central stimuli is retained, however, presenting a potential target for preventing weight regain.",

    "abstract": "Weight changes are accompanied by imbalances between calorie intake and expenditure. This fact is often misinterpreted to suggest that obesity is caused by gluttony and sloth and can be treated by simply advising people to eat less and move more. Rather various components of energy balance are dynamically interrelated and weight loss is resisted by counterbalancing physiological processes. While low-carbohydrate diets have been suggested to partially subvert these processes by increasing energy expenditure and promoting fat loss, our meta-analysis of 32 controlled feeding studies with isocaloric substitution of carbohydrate for fat found that both energy expenditure (26 kcal/d; P <.0001) and fat loss (16 g/d; P <.0001) were greater with lower fat diets. We review the components of energy balance and the mechanisms acting to resist weight loss in the context of static, settling point, and set-point models of body weight regulation, with the set-point model being most commensurate with current data.",

    "abstract": "In most modern societies, the relationship that many individuals have with food has fundamentally changed from previous generations. People have shifted away from viewing food as primarily sustenance, and rather now seek out foods based on pure palatability or specific nutrition. However, it is far from clear what optimal nutrition is for the general population or specific individuals. We previously described the Food Triangle as a way to organize food based on an increasing energy density paradigm, and now expand on this model to predict the impact of oxidative priority and both nutrient and fiber density in relation to caloric load. When combined with meal frequency, integrated energy expenditure, macronutrient oxidative priority, and fuel partitioning expressed by the respiratory quotient, our model also offers a novel explanation for chronic overnutrition and the cause of excess body fat accumulation. Herein, we not only review how metabolism is a dynamic process subject to many regulators that mediate the fate of ingested calories but also discuss how the Food Triangle predicts the oxidative priority of ingested foods and provides a conceptual paradigm for healthy eating supported by health and longevity research.",

    "abstract": "Fatty liver diseases are complications of the metabolic syndrome associated with obesity, insulin resistance and low grade inflammation. Our aim was to uncover mechanisms contributing to hepatic complications in this setting. We used foz/foz mice prone to obesity, insulin resistance and progressive fibrosing non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Foz/foz mice are hyperphagic but wild-type (WT)-matched calorie intake failed to protect against obesity, adipose inflammation and glucose intolerance. Obese foz/foz mice had similar physical activity level but reduced energy expenditure. Thermogenic adaptation to high-fat diet (HFD) or to cold exposure was severely impaired in foz/foz mice compared with HFD-fed WT littermates due to lower sympathetic tone in their brown adipose tissue (BAT). Intermittent cold exposure (ICE) restored BAT function and thereby improved glucose tolerance, decreased fat mass and liver steatosis. We conclude that failure of BAT adaptation drives the metabolic complications of obesity in foz/foz mice, including development of liver steatosis. Induction of endogenous BAT function had a significant therapeutic impact on obesity, glucose tolerance and liver complications and is a potential new avenue for therapy of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).",

    "title": "Ventromedial hypothalamic melanocortin receptor activation: regulation of activity energy expenditure and skeletal muscle thermogenesis.",
    "abstract": "The ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) and the central melanocortin system both play vital roles in regulating energy balance by modulating energy intake and utilization. Recent evidence suggests that activation of the VMH alters skeletal muscle metabolism. We show that intra-VMH melanocortin receptor activation increases energy expenditure and physical activity, switches fuel utilization to fats, and lowers work efficiency such that excess calories are dissipated by skeletal muscle as heat. We also show that intra-VMH melanocortin receptor activation increases sympathetic nervous system outflow to skeletal muscle. Intra-VMH melanocortin receptor activation also induced significant changes in the expression of mediators of energy expenditure in muscle. These results support the role of melanocortin receptors in the VMH in the modulation of skeletal muscle metabolism. The ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) and the brain melanocortin system both play vital roles in increasing energy expenditure (EE) and physical activity, decreasing appetite and modulating sympathetic nervous system (SNS) outflow. Because of recent evidence showing that VMH activation modulates skeletal muscle metabolism, we propose the existence of an axis between the VMH and skeletal muscle, modulated by brain melanocortins, modelled on the brain control of brown adipose tissue. Activation of melanocortin receptors in the VMH of rats using a non-specific agonist melanotan II (MTII), compared to vehicle, increased oxygen consumption and EE and decreased the respiratory exchange ratio. Intra-VMH MTII enhanced activity-related EE even when activity levels were held constant. MTII treatment increased gastrocnemius muscle heat dissipation during controlled activity, as well as in the home cage. Compared to vehicle-treated rats, rats with intra-VMH melanocortin receptor activation had higher skeletal muscle norepinephrine turnover, indicating an increased SNS drive to muscle. Lastly, intra-VMH MTII induced mRNA expression of muscle energetic mediators, whereas short-term changes at the protein level were primarily limited to phosphorylation events. These results support the hypothesis that melanocortin peptides act in the VMH to increase EE by lowering the economy of activity via the enhanced expression of mediators of EE in the periphery including skeletal muscle. The data are consistent with the role of melanocortins in the VMH in the modulation of skeletal muscle metabolism.",

    "abstract": "Diets deficient in protein often increase food consumption, body weight and fat mass; however, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. We compared the effects of diets varying in protein concentrations on energy balance in obesity-prone rats. We demonstrate that protein-free (0% protein calories) diets decreased energy intake and increased energy expenditure, very low protein (5% protein) diets increased energy intake and expenditure, whereas moderately low protein (10% protein) diets increased energy intake without altering expenditure, relative to control diet (15% protein). These diet-induced alterations in energy expenditure are in part mediated through enhanced serotonergic and β-adrenergic signaling coupled with upregulation of key thermogenic markers in brown fat and skeletal muscle. The protein-free and very low protein diets decreased plasma concentrations of multiple essential amino acids, anorexigenic and metabolic hormones, but these diets increased the tissue expression and plasma concentrations of fibroblast growth factor-21. Protein-free and very low protein diets induced fatty liver, reduced energy digestibility, and decreased lean mass and body weight that persisted beyond the restriction period. In contrast, moderately low protein diets promoted gain in body weight and adiposity following the period of protein restriction. Together, our findings demonstrate that low protein diets produce divergent effects on energy balance.",

    "title": "The Effects of a Hypocaloric Diet on Diet-Induced Thermogenesis and Blood Hormone Response in Healthy Male Adults: A Pilot Study.",
    "abstract": "Calorie restriction is a common strategy for weight loss and management. Consumption of food and nutrients stimulates diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT), as well as pancreatic and gastrointestinal hormone secretion that may regulate energy metabolism. Yet, little is known about the impact of hypocaloric diets on energy metabolism-related parameters. In this study, we assessed the effects of hypocaloric diets on hormonal variance in relation to DIT in healthy adults. Ten healthy male adults were enrolled in a randomized crossover study comprising three meal trials. Each subject was given a meal of 200 (extremely hypocaloric), 400 (moderately hypocaloric), or 800 kcal (normocaloric). Postprandial blood variables and energy expenditure were measured for 4 h (after the 200- and 400-kcal meals) or 6 h (after the 800-kcal meal). DIT and postprandial changes in blood pancreatic peptide and ghrelin were significantly smaller after the extremely or moderately hypocaloric diet than after the normocaloric diet but were similar between the hypocaloric diets. Postprandial blood insulin, amylin, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), and glucagon-like peptide type-1 (GLP-1) increased in a calorie-dependent manner. Thermogenic efficiency (DIT per energy intake) was negatively correlated with the maximum blood level (Cmax) (p=0.01) and incremental area under the curve (p=0.01) of the blood GIP response. Calorie restriction thus leads to hormonal responses and lower DIT in healthy adults. Extreme calorie restriction, however, led to greater thermogenic efficiency compared with moderate calorie restriction. The postprandial GIP response may be a good predictor of postprandial thermogenic efficiency.",

Since the discovery that brown and beige fat cells exist in adult humans and contribute to energy expenditure, increasing interest has been devoted to the understanding of the molecular switches turning on calorie utilization. It has been reported that the ability of thermogenic tissues to burn energy declines during aging, possibly contributing to the development of metabolic dysfunction late in life.

    "title": "Forkhead box A3 mediates glucocorticoid receptor function in adipose tissue.",
    "abstract": "Glucocorticoids (GCs) are widely prescribed anti-inflammatory agents, but their chronic use leads to undesirable side effects such as excessive expansion of adipose tissue. We have recently shown that the forkhead box protein A3 (Foxa3) is a calorie-hoarding factor that regulates the selective enlargement of epididymal fat depots and suppresses energy expenditure in a nutritional- and age-dependent manner. It has been demonstrated that Foxa3 levels are elevated in adipose depots in response to high-fat diet regimens and during the aging process; however no studies to date have elucidated the mechanisms that control Foxa3's expression in fat. Given the established effects of GCs in increasing visceral adiposity and in reducing thermogenesis, we assessed the existence of a possible link between GCs and Foxa3. Computational prediction analysis combined with molecular studies revealed that Foxa3 is regulated by the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in preadipocytes, adipocytes, and adipose tissues and is required to facilitate the binding of the GR to its target gene promoters in fat depots. Analysis of the long-term effects of dexamethasone treatment in mice revealed that Foxa3 ablation protects mice specifically against fat accretion but not against other pathological side effects elicited by this synthetic GC in tissues such as liver, muscle, and spleen. In conclusion our studies provide the first demonstration, to our knowledge, that Foxa3 is a direct target of GC action in adipose tissues and point to a role of Foxa3 as a mediator of the side effects induced in fat tissues by chronic treatment with synthetic steroids.",

    "title": "Improved Muscle Mitochondrial Capacity Following Gastric Bypass Surgery in Obese Subjects.",
    "abstract": "Weight loss resulting from low-calorie diets is often less than expected. We hypothesized that energy restriction would influence proton leakage and improve mitochondrial efficiency, leading to reduced energy expenditure, partly explaining the difficulties in weight loss maintenance. Eleven women with a median BMI of 38.5 kg/m(2) (q-range 37-40), and referred to gastric bypass surgery participated. Before surgery, and at 6 months of follow-up, muscle biopsies were collected from the vastus lateralis muscle. Mitochondria were isolated and analyzed for coupled (state 3) and uncoupled (state 4) respiration and mitochondrial capacity (P/O ratio). At follow-up, the participants had a median BMI of 29.6 kg/m(2) (28.3-32.0). State 3 increased from 20.6 (17.9-28.9) to 34.9 nmol O2/min/U citrate synthase (CS) (27.0-49.0), p = 0.01, while state 4 increased from 2.8 (1.8-4.2) to 4.2 nmol O2/min/U CS (3.1-6.1), although not statistically significant. The P/O ratio increased from 2.7 (2.5-2.8) to 3.2 (3.0-3.4), p = 0.02, indicating improved mitochondrial efficiency. Six months after gastric bypass surgery, the mitochondrial capacity for coupled, i.e., ATP-generating, respiration increased, and the P/O ratio improved. Uncoupled respiration was not enhanced to the same extent. This could partly explain the decreased basal metabolism and the reduced inclination for weight loss during energy restriction.",

    "abstract": "Recent evidence has suggested that AHNAK expression is altered in obesity, although its role in adipose tissue development remains unclear. The objective of this study was to determine the molecular mechanism by which Ahnak influences adipogenesis and glucose homeostasis. We investigated the in vitro role of AHNAK in adipogenesis using adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) and C3H10T1/2 cells. AHNAK-KO male mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD; 60% calories from fat) and examined for glucose and insulin tolerances, for body fat compositions, and by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamping. Energy expenditures were assessed using metabolic cages and by measuring the expression levels of genes involved in thermogenesis in white or brown adipose tissues. Adipogenesis in ADSCs was impaired in AHNAK-KO mice. The loss of AHNAK led to decreased BMP4/SMAD1 signaling, resulting in the downregulation of key regulators of adipocyte differentiation (P<0.05). AHNAK directly interacted with SMAD1 on the Pparγ2 promoter. Concomitantly, HFD-fed AHNAK-KO mice displayed reduced hepatosteatosis and improved metabolic profiles, including improved glucose tolerance (P<0.001), enhanced insulin sensitivity (P<0.001), and increased energy expenditure (P<0.05), without undergoing alterations in food intake and physical activity. AHNAK plays a crucial role in body fat accumulation by regulating adipose tissue development via interaction with the SMAD1 protein and can be involved in metabolic homeostasis.",

    "title": "Role of histone deacetylase 9 in regulating adipogenic differentiation and high fat diet-induced metabolic disease.",
    "abstract": "Adipose tissue serves as both a storage site for excess calories and as an endocrine organ, secreting hormones such as adiponectin that promote metabolic homeostasis. In obesity, adipose tissue expands primarily by hypertrophy (enlargement of existing adipocytes) rather than hyperplasia (generation of new adipocytes via adipogenic differentiation of preadipocytes). Progressive adipocyte hypertrophy leads to inflammation, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and ectopic lipid deposition, the hallmark characteristics of metabolic disease. We demonstrate that during chronic high fat feeding in mice, adipogenic differentiation is impaired due to the actions of histone deacetylase 9 (HDAC9), a member of the class II family of HDACs. Mechanistically, upregulated HDAC9 expression blocks the adipogenic differentiation program during chronic high fat feeding, leading to accumulation of improperly differentiated adipocytes with diminished expression of adiponectin. These adipocytes are inefficient at storing lipid, resulting in ectopic lipid deposition in the liver. HDAC9 gene deletion prevents the detrimental effects of chronic high fat feeding on adipogenic differentiation, increases adiponectin expression, and enhances energy expenditure by promoting beige adipogenesis, thus leading to reduced body mass and improved metabolic homeostasis. HDAC9 is therefore emerging as a critical regulator of adipose tissue health and a novel therapeutic target for obesity-related disease.",

    "abstract": "Dissipating excess calories as heat through therapeutic stimulation of brown adipose tissues (BAT) has been proposed as a potential treatment for obesity-linked disorders. Here, we describe the generation of a humanized effector-less bispecific antibody that activates fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) 1/βKlotho complex, a common receptor for FGF21 and FGF19. Using this molecule, we show that antibody-mediated activation of FGFR1/βKlotho complex in mice induces sustained energy expenditure in BAT, browning of white adipose tissue, weight loss, and improvements in obesity-associated metabolic derangements including insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia and hepatosteatosis. In mice and cynomolgus monkeys, FGFR1/βKlotho activation increased serum high-molecular-weight adiponectin, which appears to contribute over time by enhancing the amplitude of the metabolic benefits. At the same time, insulin sensitization by FGFR1/βKlotho activation occurs even before the onset of weight loss in a manner that is independent of adiponectin. Together, selective activation of FGFR1/βKlotho complex with a long acting therapeutic antibody represents an attractive approach for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and other obesity-linked disorders through enhanced energy expenditure, insulin sensitization and induction of high-molecular-weight adiponectin.",

    "title": "Energy Balance After Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter 2 Inhibition.",
    "abstract": "Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors cause substantially less weight loss than expected from the energy excreted via glycosuria. Our aim was to analyze this phenomenon quantitatively. Eighty-six patients with type 2 diabetes (HbA1c 7.8 ± 0.8% [62 ± 9 mmol/mol], estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] 89 ± 19 mL ⋅ min(-1) ⋅ 1.73 m(-2)) received empagliflozin (25 mg/day) for 90 weeks with frequent (n = 11) assessments of body weight, eGFR, and fasting plasma glucose (FPG). Time-dependent glucose filtration was calculated as the product of eGFR and FPG; time-dependent glycosuria was estimated from previous direct measurements. The relation of calorie-to-weight changes was estimated using a mathematical model of human energy metabolism that simulates the time course of weight change for a given change in calorie balance and calculates the corresponding energy intake changes. At week 90, weight loss averaged -3.2 ± 4.2 kg (corresponding to a median calorie deficit of 51 kcal/day [interquartile range (IQR) 112]). However, the observed calorie loss through glycosuria (206 kcal/day [IQR 90]) was predicted to result in a weight loss of -11.3 ± 3.1 kg, assuming no compensatory changes in energy intake. Thus, patients lost only 29 ± 41% of the weight loss predicted by their glycosuria; the model indicated that this difference was accounted for by a 13% (IQR 12) increase in calorie intake (269 kcal/day [IQR 258]) coupled with a 2% (IQR 5) increase in daily energy expenditure (due to diet-induced thermogenesis). This increased calorie intake was inversely related to baseline BMI (partial r = -0.34, P < 0.01) and positively to baseline eGFR (partial r = 0.29, P < 0.01). Chronic glycosuria elicits an adaptive increase in energy intake. Combining SGLT2 inhibition with caloric restriction is expected to be associated with major weight loss.",

    "abstract": "Weight loss (WL) is associated with a decrease in total and resting energy expenditure (EE). We aimed to investigate whether (1) diets with different rate and extent of WL determined different changes in total and resting EE and if (2) they influenced the level of adaptive thermogenesis, defined as the decline in total or resting EE not accounted by changes in body composition. Three groups of six, obese men participated in a total fast for 6 days to achieve a 5% WL and a very low calorie (VLCD, 2.5 MJ/day) for 3 weeks or a low calorie (LCD, 5.2 MJ/day) diet for 6 weeks to achieve a 10% WL. A four-component model was used to measure body composition. Indirect calorimetry was used to measure resting EE. Total EE was measured by doubly labelled water (VLCD, LCD) and 24-hour whole-body calorimetry (fasting). VLCD and LCD showed a similar degree of metabolic adaptation for total EE (VLCD = -6.2%; LCD = -6.8%). Metabolic adaptation for resting EE was greater in the LCD (-0.4 MJ/day, -5.3%) compared to the VLCD (-0.1 MJ/day, -1.4%) group. Resting EE did not decrease after short-term fasting and no evidence of adaptive thermogenesis (+0.4 MJ/day) was found after 5% WL. The rate of WL was inversely associated with changes in resting EE (n = 30, r = 0.-42, p=0.01). The rate of WL did not appear to influence the decline in total EE in obese men after 10% WL. Approximately 6% of this decline in total EE was explained by mechanisms of adaptive thermogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is linked to cardiovascular disease. The global increase in sedentary lifestyle is an important factor contributing to the rising prevalence of the obesity epidemic. Traditionally, counseling has focused on moderate- to vigorous-intensity exercise, with disappointing results. Nonexercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT) is an important component of daily energy expenditure. It represents the common daily activities, such as fidgeting, walking, and standing. These high-effect NEAT movements could result in up to an extra 2000 kcal of expenditure per day beyond the basal metabolic rate, depending on body weight and level of activity. Implementing NEAT during leisure-time and occupational activities could be essential to maintaining a negative energy balance. NEAT can be applied by being upright, ambulating, and redesigning workplace and leisure-time environments to promote NEAT. The benefits of NEAT include not only the extra calories expended but also the reduced occurrence of the metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular events, and all-cause mortality. We believe that to overcome the obesity epidemic and its adverse cardiovascular consequences, NEAT should be part of the current medical recommendations. The content of this review is based on a literature search of PubMed and the Google search engine between January 1, 1960, and October 1, 2014, using the search terms physical activity, obesity, energy expenditure, nonexercise activity thermogenesis, and NEAT.",

    "title": "Sarcolipin Is a Key Determinant of the Basal Metabolic Rate, and Its Overexpression Enhances Energy Expenditure and Resistance against Diet-induced Obesity.",
    "abstract": "Sarcolipin (SLN) is a novel regulator of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase (SERCA) in muscle. SLN binding to SERCA uncouples Ca(2+) transport from ATP hydrolysis. By this mechanism, SLN promotes the futile cycling of SERCA, contributing to muscle heat production. We recently showed that SLN plays an important role in cold- and diet-induced thermogenesis. However, the detailed mechanism of how SLN regulates muscle metabolism remains unclear. In this study, we used both SLN knockout (Sln(-/-)) and skeletal muscle-specific SLN overexpression (Sln(OE)) mice to explore energy metabolism by pair feeding (fixed calories) and high-fat diet feeding (ad libitum). Our results show that, upon pair feeding, Sln(OE) mice lost weight compared with the WT, but Sln(-/-) mice gained weight. Interestingly, when fed with a high-fat diet, Sln(OE) mice consumed more calories but gained less weight and maintained a normal metabolic profile in comparison with WT and Sln(-/-) mice. We found that oxygen consumption and fatty acid oxidation were increased markedly in Sln(OE) mice. There was also an increase in both mitochondrial number and size in Sln(OE) muscle, together with increased expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor δ (PPARδ) and PPAR γ coactivator 1 α (PGC1α), key transcriptional activators of mitochondrial biogenesis and enzymes involved in oxidative metabolism. These results, taken together, establish an important role for SLN in muscle metabolism and energy expenditure. On the basis of these data we propose that SLN is a novel target for enhancing whole-body energy expenditure.",

    "abstract": "Weight cycling may lead to adverse effects on metabolic efficiency (i.e. adaptive thermogenesis or 'metabolic slowing') and metabolic risks (e.g. increased risk for insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome). In order to investigate these topics, the partitioning of fat and lean mass (i.e. the change in the proportion of both compartments) needs to be extended to the organ and tissue level because metabolic risk differs between adipose tissue depots and lean mass is metabolically heterogeneous being composed of organs and tissues differing in metabolic rate. Contrary to data obtained with severe weight loss and regain in lean people, weight cycling most likely has no adverse effects on fat distribution and metabolic risk in obese patients. There is even evidence for an increased ability of fat storage in subcutaneous fat depots (at the trunk in men and at the limbs in women) with weight cycling that may provide a certain protection from ectopic lipid deposition and thus explain the preservation of a favourable metabolic profile despite weight regain. On the other hand, the mass-specific metabolic rate of lean mass may increase with weight gain and decrease with weight loss mainly because of an increase and respective decrease in the proportion (and/or activity) of metabolically active organ mass. Obese people could therefore have a higher slope of the regression line between resting energy expenditure (REE) and fat-free mass that leads to an overestimation of metabolic efficiency when applied to normalize REE data after weight loss. Furthermore, in addressing the impact of macronutrient composition of the diet on partitioning of lean and fat mass, and the old controversy about whether a calorie is a calorie, we discuss recent evidence in support of a low glycaemic weight maintenance diet in countering weight regain and challenge this concept for weight loss by proposing the opposite.",

    "abstract": "Consumption of energy drinks is increasing amongst athletes and the general public. By virtue of their bioactive ingredients (including caffeine, taurine, glucuronolactone, and B-group vitamins) and paucity of calories, sugar-free \"diet\" versions of these drinks could be a useful aid for weight maintenance. Yet little is known about the acute influence of these drinks, and specifically the role of the cocktail of non-caffeine ingredients, on resting energy expenditure (REE) and substrate oxidation. Therefore, the metabolic impact of sugar-free Red Bull (sfRB) to a comparable amount of caffeine was compared. REE and respiratory quotient (RQ) were measured in eight healthy young men by ventilated-hood indirect calorimetry for 30 min baseline and 2 h following ingestion of 355 ml of either: sfRB + placebo, water + 120 mg caffeine, or water + placebo, according to a randomized cross-over design. sfRB and water + caffeine both increased REE to the same degree (+4%). Additionally, sfRB briefly increased RQ. Water + caffeine had no effect on RQ relative to water + placebo. sfRB enhanced thermogenesis and marginally shifted RQ to favor carbohydrate oxidation. The stimulatory effects of sfRB on REE are mimicked by water + caffeine, indicating that the auxiliary ingredients do not influence this thermic effect. The metabolic effects of sfRB are primarily due to caffeine alone.",

    "abstract": "Brown fat can reduce obesity through the dissipation of calories as heat. Control of thermogenic gene expression occurs via the induction of various coactivators, most notably PGC-1α. In contrast, the transcription factor partner(s) of these cofactors are poorly described. Here, we identify interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) as a dominant transcriptional effector of thermogenesis. IRF4 is induced by cold and cAMP in adipocytes and is sufficient to promote increased thermogenic gene expression, energy expenditure, and cold tolerance. Conversely, knockout of IRF4 in UCP1(+) cells causes reduced thermogenic gene expression and energy expenditure, obesity, and cold intolerance. IRF4 also induces the expression of PGC-1α and PRDM16 and interacts with PGC-1α, driving Ucp1 expression. Finally, cold, β-agonists, or forced expression of PGC-1α are unable to cause thermogenic gene expression in the absence of IRF4. These studies establish IRF4 as a transcriptional driver of a program of thermogenic gene expression and energy expenditure.",

    "title": "Leanness and heightened nonresting energy expenditure: role of skeletal muscle activity thermogenesis.",
    "abstract": "A high-calorie diet accompanied by low levels of physical activity (PA) accounts for the widespread prevalence of obesity today, and yet some people remain lean even in this obesogenic environment. Here, we investigate the cause for this exception. A key trait that predicts high PA in both humans and laboratory rodents is intrinsic aerobic capacity. Rats artificially selected as high-capacity runners (HCR) are lean and consistently more physically active than their low-capacity runner (LCR) counterparts; this applies to both males and females. Here, we demonstrate that HCR show heightened total energy expenditure (TEE) and hypothesize that this is due to higher nonresting energy expenditure (NREE; includes activity EE). After matching for body weight and lean mass, female HCR consistently had heightened nonresting EE, but not resting EE, compared with female LCR. Because of the dominant role of skeletal muscle in nonresting EE, we examined muscle energy use. We found that lean female HCR had higher muscle heat dissipation during activity, explaining their low economy of activity and high activity EE. This may be due to the amplified skeletal muscle expression levels of proteins involved in EE and reduced expression levels of proteins involved in energy conservation in HCR relative to LCR. This is also associated with an increased sympathetic drive to skeletal muscle in HCR compared with LCR. We find little support for the hypothesis that resting metabolic rate is correlated with maximal aerobic capacity if body size and composition are fully considered; rather, the critical factor appears to be activity thermogenesis.",

    "title": "Enhancement of brown fat thermogenesis using chenodeoxycholic acid in mice.",
    "abstract": "Besides their role in lipid absorption, bile acids (BAs) can act as signalling molecules. Cholic acid was shown to counteract obesity and associated metabolic disorders in high-fat-diet (cHF)-fed mice while enhancing energy expenditure through induction of mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and activation of non-shivering thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue (BAT). In this study, the effects of another natural BA, chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), on dietary obesity, UCP1 in both interscapular BAT and in white adipose tissue (brite cells in WAT), were characterized in dietary-obese mice. To induce obesity and associated metabolic disorders, male 2-month-old C57BL/6J mice were fed cHF (35% lipid wt wt(-1), mainly corn oil) for 4 months. Mice were then fed either (i) for 8 weeks with cHF or with cHF with two different doses (0.5%, 1%; wt wt(-1)) of CDCA (8-week reversion); or (ii) for 3 weeks with cHF or with cHF with 1% CDCA, or pair-fed (PF) to match calorie intake of the CDCA mice fed ad libitum; mice on standard chow diet were also used (3-week reversion). In the 8-week reversion, the CDCA intervention resulted in a dose-dependent reduction of obesity, dyslipidaemia and glucose intolerance, which could be largely explained by a transient decrease in food intake. The 3-week reversion revealed mild CDCA-dependent and food intake-independent induction of UCP1-mediated thermogenesis in interscapular BAT, negligible increase of UCP1 in subcutaneous WAT and a shift from carbohydrate to lipid oxidation. CDCA could reverse obesity in cHF-fed mice, mainly in response to the reduction in food intake, an effect probably occuring but neglected in previous studies using cholic acid. Nevertheless, CDCA-dependent and food intake-independent induction of UCP1 in BAT (but not in WAT) could contribute to the reduction in adiposity and to the stabilization of the lean phenotype.",

    "abstract": "Nutrition plays a dominant role in human adaptation. Biological traits conferring these adaptations are of considerable significance. Within an obesogenic environment, there is considerable variation among individuals in their susceptibility to weight gain. Some individuals rapidly gain weight, whereas others remain lean without any conscious effort, suggesting that obesity pathogenesis may not be centered on just the primal feeding behavior. The ability of certain individuals to subconsciously resist obesity reveals adaptive calorie-burning mechanisms that may promote fitness. Here, we review a fat-burning mechanism that is turned on by the brain hormone orexin during high-caloric food consumption. Remarkably, the same hormone also induces feeding, and its levels correlate with lean body mass in both rodents and humans. Intriguingly, loss of orexin prevents thermogenic energy expenditure while inducing obesity in the face of hypophagia. Thus, orexin is a unique neuropeptide that promotes both feeding and energy expenditure, conferring resistance to weight gain. Mechanisms that safely augment orexin signaling may have potential in antiobesity therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "For brown adipose tissue (BAT) to be effective at consuming calories, its blood flow must increase enough to provide sufficient fuel to sustain energy expenditure and also transfer the heat created to avoid thermal injury. Here we used a combination of human and rodent models to assess changes in BAT blood flow and glucose utilization. (99m)Tc-methoxyisobutylisonitrile (MIBI) SPECT (n = 7) and SPECT/CT (n = 74) scans done in adult humans for parathyroid imaging were reviewed for uptake in regions consistent with human BAT. Site-directed biopsies of subcutaneous and deep neck fat were obtained for electron microscopy and gene expression profiling. In mice, tissue perfusion was measured with (99m)Tc-MIBI (n = 16) and glucose uptake with (18)F-FDG (n = 16). Animals were kept fasting overnight, anesthetized with pentobarbital, and given intraperitoneally either the β3-adrenergic receptor agonist CL-316,243, 1 mg/kg (n = 8), or saline (n = 8) followed by radiotracer injection 5 min later. After 120 min, the mice were imaged using SPECT/CT or PET/CT. Vital signs were recorded over 30 min during the imaging. BAT, white adipose tissue (WAT), muscle, liver, and heart were resected, and tissue uptake of both (99m)Tc-MIBI and (18)F-FDG was quantified by percentage injected dose per gram of tissue and normalized to total body weight. In 5.4% of patients (4/74), (99m)Tc-MIBI SPECT/CT showed increased retention in cervical and supraclavicular fat that displayed multilocular lipid droplets, dense capillary investment, and a high concentration of ovoid mitochondria. Expression levels of the tissue-specific uncoupling protein-1 were 180 times higher in BAT than in subcutaneous WAT (P < 0.001). In mice, BAT tissue perfusion increased by 61% (P < 0.01), with no significant changes in blood flow to WAT, muscle, heart, or liver. CL-316,243 increased glucose uptake in BAT even more, by 440% (P < 0.01). Pharmacologic activation of BAT requires increased blood flow to deliver glucose and oxygen for thermogenesis. However, the glucose consumption far exceeds the vascular response. These findings demonstrate that activated BAT increases glucose uptake beyond what might occur by increased blood flow alone and suggest that activated BAT likely uses glucose for nonthermogenic purposes.",

    "title": "High cortisol responses identify propensity for obesity that is linked to thermogenesis in skeletal muscle.",
    "abstract": "Subjects characterized as cortisol high responders (HRs) consume more calories after stress, but it is unknown whether cortisol responsiveness predicts a propensity for obesity. Female sheep with either high or low cortisol responses to adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) were identified. Body composition was similar in HRs and cortisol low responders (LRs), but the HRs had greater (P<0.01) adiposity than did the LRs (40.5±0.7 vs. 35.8±1.4%) after high-energy feeding, despite comparable food intake. Postprandial thermogenesis in muscle temperature was 0.8 ± 0.08°C higher in the LRs than in the HRs (P<0.01), whereas feeding-induced changes in fat temperature were similar. Leptin and insulin sensitivity were similar in the HRs and LRs. Feeding lowered (P<0.001) the respiratory control ratio in muscle (HRs 9.2±0.8-5.2±1.2; LRs 8.4±0.5-5.2±0.7), indicative of increased uncoupled respiration. Also in muscle, the feeding-induced increases in uncoupling protein (UCP)-3 (fold increase: HRs, 2.4; LRs, 2.0), ryanodine 1 receptor (RyR1; fold increase: HRs 3.1; LRs 2.1), and sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-dependent ATPase (fold increase: HRs 1.5; LRs 1.6) were equivalent in the HRs and LRs. Sequencing of mitochondrial DNA revealed no haplotypic differences between the 2 groups. We conclude that predisposition to obesity can be predicted by cortisol responsiveness to an ACTH challenge and that the response is due to innate differences in muscle thermogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Two types of fat, white adipose tissue (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT), exist in mammals including adult humans. While WAT stores excess calories and an excessive accumulation of fat causes obesity, BAT dissipates energy to produce heat through nonshivering thermogenesis for protection against cold environments and provides the potential for the development of novel anti-obesity treatments. The hypothalamus plays a central role in the control of energy balance. Specifically, recent observations indicate the importance of the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH) in thermoregulation. We have found that the orexigenic neuropeptide Y (NPY) in the DMH has distinct actions in modulating adiposity and BAT thermogenesis. Knockdown of NPY in the DMH elevates the thermogenic activity of classic BAT and promotes the development of brown adipocytes in WAT, leading to increased thermogenesis. These findings identify a novel potential target for combating obesity.",

    "title": "Effect of dairy proteins on appetite, energy expenditure, body weight, and composition: a review of the evidence from controlled clinical trials.",
    "abstract": "Evidence supports that a high proportion of calories from protein increases weight loss and prevents weight (re)gain. Proteins are known to induce satiety, increase secretion of gastrointestinal hormones, and increase diet-induced thermogenesis, but less is known about whether various types of proteins exert different metabolic effects. In the Western world, dairy protein, which consists of 80% casein and 20% whey, is a large contributor to our daily protein intake. Casein and whey differ in absorption and digestion rates, with casein being a \"slow\" protein and whey being a \"fast\" protein. In addition, they differ in amino acid composition. This review examines whether casein, whey, and other protein sources exert different metabolic effects and targets to clarify the underlying mechanisms. Data indicate that whey is more satiating in the short term, whereas casein is more satiating in the long term. In addition, some studies indicate that whey stimulates the secretion of the incretin hormones glucagon-like peptide-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide more than other proteins. However, for the satiety (cholecystokinin and peptide YY) and hunger-stimulating (ghrelin) hormones, no clear evidence exists that 1 protein source has a greater stimulating effect compared with others. Likewise, no clear evidence exists that 1 protein source results in higher diet-induced thermogenesis and promotes more beneficial changes in body weight and composition compared with other protein sources. However, data indicate that amino acid composition, rate of absorption, and protein/food texture may be important factors for protein-stimulated metabolic effects.",

    "abstract": "Studies in rodents have shown that brown adipose tissue (BAT) is activated on food intake, thereby reducing metabolic efficiency. The current study investigated whether a single high-calorie, carbohydrate-rich meal activates BAT in lean human adults. BAT activity was studied in 11 lean adult men [age: 23.6 ± 2.1 y; body mass index (BMI; in kg/m(2)): 22.4 ± 2.1] after consumption of a high-calorie, carbohydrate-rich meal (1622 ± 222 kcal; 78% carbohydrate, 12% protein, 10% fat). BAT activity during 2 h of mild cold exposure served as a positive control experiment. BAT activity was assessed by [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography-computed tomography. Energy expenditure was measured by indirect calorimetry. Postprandial [(18)F]FDG uptake was significantly higher in BAT [1.65 ± 0.99 mean standard uptake value (SUVmean)] than in subcutaneous (0.35 ± 0.15 SUVmean; P < 0.05) and visceral (0.49 ± 0.24 SUVmean; P < 0.05) white adipose tissue and liver (0.95 ± 0.28 SUVmean; P < 0.05). Postprandial BAT activity was lower than cold-induced BAT activity (7.19 ± 2.09 SUVmean). However, postprandial BAT activity may have been underestimated because of high postprandial [(18)F]FDG uptake in skeletal muscle compared with cold (1.36 ± 0.31 compared with 0.59 ± 0.07 SUVmean, P < 0.05), which reduces [(18)F]FDG bioavailability for BAT and other tissues. No direct relation was found between BAT and diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT). Glucose uptake in BAT increases after a meal in humans, which indicates a role for BAT in reducing metabolic efficiency. However, the quantitative contribution of BAT to DIT relative to other tissues, such as skeletal muscle, remains to be investigated. This trial was registered at www.controlled-trials.com as ISRCTN21413505.",

    "title": "Leptin increasing sympathetic nerve outflow in obesity: A cure for obesity or a potential contributor to metabolic syndrome?",
    "abstract": "Obesity is a global problem and effective drug therapy treatment is still unavailable. Obesity develops due to an imbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure (EE). Understanding what happens to EE in obesity may be the key to developing new treatments for obesity. If EE in obesity can be elevated, it could be a potential therapeutic target. We recently discovered that in baseline conditions obese mice have increased EE, in terms of thermogenesis. However, this increase in EE is not great enough to offset the elevated calorie intake that leads to the development of obesity. In obesity, the adipose derived hormone leptin is significantly elevated. This elevated leptin concentration appears to cause an increase in thermogenesis through increased sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) to brown adipose tissue deposits. The brain region of the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH) appears to be a key region that leptin activates in obesity to cause this increased thermogenesis. One unsettling finding is that the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) in obesity is elevated via leptin and it seems unlikely that SNA would be selectivity increased to only brown adipose tissue. Previously, it has been observed that leptin can increase SNA to numerous organs including the kidney. Furthermore, in obesity, SNA is increased in numerous organs. This leads to the critical question: is the leptin-mediated elevation of SNA and thermogenesis also chronically activating the kidney and contributing to the development of hypertension in obesity?",

    "abstract": "Individual variation in the ability to convert excess calories to heat and the effects of dietary macronutrient composition are unclear. Stability and determinants of the energy expenditure (EE) response to overconsumption were assessed. Twenty subjects (75% male) with normal glucose regulation were evaluated during 24 hours each of energy balance, fasting, and 5 different diets with 200% energy requirements in a clinical research unit. Five 1-day overfeeding diets were given in random order: high carbohydrate (75%) and low protein (3%); high carbohydrate and normal protein (20%); high fat (46%) and low protein; high fat (60%) and normal protein; and balanced (50% carbohydrates, 20% protein). The 24-hour EE, sleeping EE, and thermic effect of food (TEF) during each diet were measured with a metabolic chamber. Appetitive hormones were measured before and after the diets. The EE response to overfeeding exhibited good intraindividual reproducibility. Similar increases above eucaloric feeding in 24-hour EE (mean 10.7 ± 5.7%, P < .001; range 2.9-18.8%) and sleeping EE (14.4 ± 11.3%, P < .001; range 1.0-45.1%) occurred when overfeeding diets containing 20% protein, despite differences in fat and carbohydrate content, but the EE response during overfeeding diets containing 3% protein was attenuated. The percent body fat negatively correlated with TEF during normal protein overfeeding (r = -0.53, P < .01). Fasting peptide YY negatively correlated with TEF (r = -0.56, P < .01) and the increase in sleeping EE (r = -0.54, P < .01) during overfeeding. There is an intrinsic EE response to overfeeding that negatively associates with adiposity, although it represents a small percentage of consumed calories.",

    "abstract": "The imbalance between energy intake and expenditure is the underlying cause of the current obesity and diabetes pandemics. Central to these pathologies is the fat depot: white adipose tissue (WAT) stores excess calories, and brown adipose tissue (BAT) consumes fuel for thermogenesis using tissue-specific uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). BAT was once thought to have a functional role in rodents and human infants only, but it has been recently shown that in response to mild cold exposure, adult human BAT consumes more glucose per gram than any other tissue. In addition to this nonshivering thermogenesis, human BAT may also combat weight gain by becoming more active in the setting of increased whole-body energy intake. This phenomenon of BAT-mediated diet-induced thermogenesis has been observed in rodents and suggests that activation of human BAT could be used as a safe treatment for obesity and metabolic dysregulation. In this study, we isolated anatomically defined neck fat from adult human volunteers and compared its gene expression, differentiation capacity and basal oxygen consumption to different mouse adipose depots. Although the properties of human neck fat vary substantially between individuals, some human samples share many similarities with classical, also called constitutive, rodent BAT.",

    "title": "Stimulation of mitochondrial oxidative capacity in white fat independent of UCP1: a key to lean phenotype.",
    "abstract": "We are facing a revival of the strategy to counteract obesity and associated metabolic disorders by inducing thermogenesis mediated by mitochondrial uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1). Thus, the main focus is on the adaptive non-shivering thermogenesis occurring both in the typical depots of brown adipose tissue (BAT) and in UCP1-containing cells that could be induced in white adipose tissue (WAT). Because contribution of WAT to resting metabolic rate is relatively small, the possibility to reduce adiposity by enhancing energy expenditure in classical white adipocytes is largely neglected. However, several pieces of evidence support a notion that induction of energy expenditure based on oxidation of fatty acids (FA) in WAT may be beneficial for health, namely: (i) studies in both humans and rodents document negative association between oxidative capacity of mitochondria in WAT and obesity; (ii) pharmacological activation of AMPK in rats as well as cold-acclimation of UCP1-ablated mice results in obesity resistance associated with increased oxidative capacity in WAT; and (iii) combined intervention using long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated FA (omega 3) and mild calorie restriction exerted synergism in the prevention of obesity in mice fed a high-fat diet; this was associated with strong hypolipidemic and insulin-sensitizing effects, as well as prevention of inflammation, and synergistic induction of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and FA oxidation, specifically in epididymal WAT. Importantly, these changes occurred without induction of UCP1 and suggested the involvement of: (i) futile substrate cycle in white adipocytes, which is based on lipolysis of intracellular triacylglycerols and re-esterification of FA, in association with the induction of mitochondrial OXPHOS capacity, β-oxidation, and energy expenditure; (ii) endogenous lipid mediators (namely endocannabinoids, eicosanoids, prostanoids, resolvins, and protectins) and their cognate receptors; and (iii) AMP-activated protein kinase in WAT. Quantitatively, the strong induction of FA oxidation in WAT in response to the combined intervention is similar to that observed in the transgenic mice rendered resistant to obesity by ectopic expression of UCP1 in WAT. The induction of UCP1-independent FA oxidation and energy expenditure in WAT in response to the above physiological stimuli could underlie the amelioration of obesity and low-grade WAT inflammation, and it could reduce the release of FA from adipose tissue and counteract harmful consequences of lipid accumulation in other tissues. In this respect, new combination treatments may be designed using naturally occurring micronutrients (e.g. omega 3), reduced calorie intake or pharmaceuticals, exerting synergism in the induction of the mitochondrial OXPHOS capacity and stimulation of lipid catabolism in white adipocytes, and improving metabolic flexibility of WAT. The role of mutual interactions between adipocytes and immune cells contained in WAT in tissue metabolism should be better characterised.

    "abstract": "Although weight cycling is frequent in obese patients, the adverse consequences on body composition and an increased propensity to weight gain remain controversial. We investigated the effect of intentional weight loss and spontaneous regain on fat distribution, the composition of lean mass and resting energy expenditure (REE). Weight regainers (≥ 30% of loss, n=27) and weight-stable subjects (within <± 20% of weight change, n=20) were selected from 103 overweight and obese subjects (body mass index 28-43 kg m(-2), 24-45 years) who passed a 13-week low-calorie diet intervention. REE and body composition (by densitometry and whole-body magnetic resonance imaging) were examined at baseline, after weight loss and at 6 months of follow-up. Mean weight loss was -12.3 ± 3.3 kg in weight-stable subjects and -9.0 ± 4.3 kg in weight regainers (P<0.01). Weight regain was incomplete, accounting for 83 and 42% of weight loss in women and men. Regain in total fat and different adipose tissue depots was in proportion to weight regain except for a higher regain in adipose tissue of the extremities in women and a lower regain in extremity and visceral adipose tissue in men. In both genders, regain in skeletal muscle of the trunk lagged behind skeletal muscle regain at the extremities. In contrast to weight-stable subjects, weight regainers showed a reduced REE adjusted for changes in organ and tissue masses after weight loss (P<0.001). Weight regain did not adversely affect body fat distribution. Weight loss-associated adaptations in REE may impair weight loss and contribute to weight regain.",

    "abstract": "Obesity in rapidly developing countries has recently become an epidemic. That is why the need to fight against this chronic disease is becoming more and more apparent. In order to lose weight it is necessary to achieve negative energy balance either by increasing physical activity or using a low calorie diet. When these methods are ineffective, pharmacotherapy is used. The criterion for the application of medical treatment is a BMI above 30 kg/m2 or above 27 along with the presence of other risk factors. Drugs for weight loss fall into three groups: appetite inhibitors, those increasing energy expenditure by enhancing thermogenesis and those inhibiting the absorption of food in the intestines. This paper presents an overview of these classes of drugs and dietary supplements with an emphasis on their adverse effects and the possibility of poisoning. Despite the fact that in Poland only one drug - orlistat has been registered for the treatment of obesity, the availability of other products is unlimited due to the Internet. This fact, and the tendency of patients to treat obesity by themselves using pharmacological substances, poses a major threat and a challenge to the toxicologist.",

    "abstract": "Long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC n-3 PUFA) exert beneficial effects on health and they could help to prevent development of obesity and associated metabolic disorders. In our previous studies in mice fed high-fat (cHF; ~60 % calories as fat) diet and maintained at 20 °C, dietary LC n-3 PUFA could counteract accretion of body fat, without inducing mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) in adipose tissue, suggesting that the anti-obesity effect was not linked to adaptive (UCP1-mediated) thermogenesis. To exclude a possible dependence of the anti-obesity effect on any mechanism inducible by cold, experiments were repeated in mice maintained at thermoneutrality (30 °C). Male C57BL/6J mice were fed either cHF diet, or cHF diet supplemented with LC n-3 PUFA, or standard diet for 7 months. Similarly as at 20 °C, the LC n-3 PUFA supplementation reduced accumulation of body fat, preserved lipid and glucose homeostasis, and induced fatty acid re-esterification in epididymal white adipose tissue. Food consumption was not affected by LC n-3 PUFA intake. Our results demonstrated anti-obesity metabolic effect of LC n-3 PUFA, independent of cold-induced thermogenesis and they suggested that induction of fatty acid re-esterification creating a substrate cycle in white fat, which results in energy expenditure, could contribute to the anti-obesity effect.",

    "title": "Adaptive thermogenesis in human body weight regulation: more of a concept than a measurable entity?",
    "abstract": "According to Lavoisier, 'Life is combustion'. But to what extent humans adapt to changes in food intake through adaptive thermogenesis--by turning down the rate of heat production during energy deficit (so as to conserve energy) or turning it up during overnutrition (so as to dissipate excess calories)--has been one of the most controversial issues in nutritional sciences over the past 100 years. The debate nowadays is not whether adaptive thermogenesis exists or not, but rather about its quantitative importance in weight homoeostasis and its clinical relevance to the pathogenesis and management of obesity. Such uncertainties are likely to persist in the foreseeable future primarily because of limitations to unobtrusively measure changes in energy expenditure and body composition with high enough accuracy and precision, particularly when even small inter-individual variations in thermogenesis can, in dynamic systems and over the long term, be important in the determining weight maintenance in some and obesity and weight regain in others. This paper reviews the considerable body of evidence, albeit fragmentary, suggesting the existence of quantitatively important adaptive thermogenesis in several compartments of energy expenditure in response to altered food intake. It then discusses the various limitations that lead to over- or underestimations in its assessment, including definitional and semantics, technical and methodological, analytical and statistical. While the role of adaptive thermogenesis in human weight regulation is likely to remain more a concept than a strictly 'quantifiable' entity in the foreseeable future, the evolution of this concept continues to fuel exciting hypothesis-driven mechanistic research which contributes to advance knowledge in human metabolism and which is bound to result in improved strategies for the management of a healthy body weight.",

    "abstract": "Core body temperature (CBT) and calorie intake are main components of energy homeostasis and two important regulators of health, longevity, and aging. In homeotherms, CBT can be influenced by calorie intake as food deprivation or calorie restriction (CR) lowers CBT whereas feeding has hyperthermic effects. The finding that in mice CBT prolonged lifespan independently of CR, suggested that the mechanisms modulating CBT may represent important regulators of aging. Here we summarize the current knowledge on the signaling molecules and their receptors that participate in the regulation of CBT responses to calorie intake. These include hypothalamic neuropeptides regulating feeding but also energy expenditure via modulation of thermogenesis. We also report studies indicating that nutrient signals can contribute to regulation of CBT by direct action on hypothalamic preoptic warm-sensitive neurons that in turn regulate adaptive thermogenesis and hence CBT. Finally, we show the role played by two orphans G protein-coupled receptor: GPR50 and GPR83, that were recently demonstrated to regulate temperature-dependent energy expenditure.",

    "title": "Effects of ambient temperature on adaptive thermogenesis during maintenance of reduced body weight in mice.",
    "abstract": "We showed previously that, at ambient room temperature (22°C), mice maintained at 20% below their initial body weight by calorie restriction expend energy at a rate below that which can be accounted for by the decrease of fat and fat-free mass. Food-restricted rodents may become torpid at subthermoneutral temperatures, a possible confounding factor when using mice as human models in obesity research. We examined the bioenergetic, hormonal, and behavioral responses to maintenance of a 20% body weight reduction in singly housed C57BL/6J +/+ and Lep(ob) mice housed at both 22°C and 30°C. Weight-reduced high-fat-fed diet mice (HFD-WR) showed similar quantitative reductions in energy expenditure-adjusted for body mass and composition-at both 22°C and 30°C: -1.4 kcal/24 h and -1.6 kcal/24 h below predicted, respectively, and neither group entered torpor. In contrast, weight-reduced Lep(ob) mice (OB-WR) housed at 22°C became torpid in the late lights-off period (0200-0500) but did not when housed at 30°C. These studies indicate that mice with an intact leptin axis display similar decreases in \"absolute\" energy expenditure in response to weight reduction at both 22°C and 30°C ambient temperature. More importantly, the \"percent\" decrease in total energy expenditure observed in the HFD-WR compared with AL mice is much greater at 30°C (-19%) than at 22°C (-10%). Basal energy expenditure demands are ∼45% lower in mice housed at 30°C vs. 22°C, since the mice housed at thermoneutrality do not allocate extra energy for heat production. The higher total energy expenditure of mice housed at 22°C due to these increased thermogenic demands may mask physiologically relevant changes in energy expenditure showing that ambient temperature must be carefully considered when quantifying energy metabolism in both rodents and humans.",

    "title": "Responsiveness to thyroid hormone and to ambient temperature underlies differences between brown adipose tissue and skeletal muscle thermogenesis in a mouse model of diet-induced obesity.",
    "abstract": "Thyroid hormone accelerates energy expenditure (EE) and is critical for cold-induced thermogenesis. To define the metabolic role played by thyroid hormone in the dissipation of calories from diet, hypothyroid mice were studied for 60 d in a comprehensive lab animal monitoring system. Hypothyroidism decreased caloric intake and body fat while down-regulating genes in the skeletal muscle but not brown adipose tissue thermogenic programs, without affecting daily EE. Only at thermoneutrality (30 C) did hypothyroid mice exhibit slower rate of EE, indicating a metabolic response to hypothyroidism that depends on ambient temperature. A byproduct of this mechanism is that at room temperature (22 C), hypothyroid mice are protected against diet-induced obesity, i.e. only at thermoneutrality did hypothyroid mice become obese when placed on a high-fat diet (HFD). This is in contrast to euthyroid controls, which on a HFD gained more body weight and fat at any temperature while activating the brown adipose tissue and accelerating daily EE but not the skeletal muscle thermogenic program. In the liver of euthyroid controls, HFD caused an approximately 5-fold increase in triglyceride content and expression of key metabolic genes, whereas acclimatization to 30 C cut triglyceride content by half and normalized gene expression. However, in hypothyroid mice, HFD-induced changes in liver persisted at 30 C, resulting in marked liver steatosis. Acclimatization to thermoneutrality dramatically improves glucose homeostasis, but this was not affected by hypothyroidism. In conclusion, hypothyroid mice are metabolically sensitive to environmental temperature, constituting a mechanism that defines resistance to diet-induced obesity and hepatic lipid metabolism.",

    "abstract": "The health consequences of the obesity epidemic are a huge burden on patients and society. Yet it remains an unmet therapeutic need. Lifestyle or behaviour modification, although desirable, seems to benefit only a few and bariatric surgery is not an option for all and not without risks. Nevertheless, bariatric surgery is currently the gold standard in terms of weight loss therapy and any weight loss agent will be in combination with management of lifestyle modification. Sadly, there is a poor history for the pharmacological treatment of obesity and repeated safety concerns have attracted intense regulatory scrutiny. Indeed, recent market withdrawals leave us with just one agent approved for the long term treatment of obesity and that is only mildly efficacious in terms of weight loss, although it is beneficial in terms of metabolic health. There are two broad pharmacological approaches that can be applied in obesity drug discovery: reduce intake (or absorption) or increase expenditure (thermogenesis) of calories. In this review we will look at the latter approach. We will cover regulatory requirements and the rationale for this approach. We believe that post-obese subjects display abnormal metabolic responses to weight loss that almost inevitably leads to weight regain. We will then explore a number of approaches that potentially increase thermogenesis in humans. The challenge we have is in accumulating enough human data to validate this approach using drugs.",

    "abstract": "Dihydrocapsiate (DCT) is a natural safe food ingredient which is structurally related to capsaicin from chili pepper and is found in the non-pungent pepper strain, CH-19 Sweet. It has been shown to elicit the thermogenic effects of capsaicin but without its gastrointestinal side effects. The present study was designed to examine the effects of DCT on both adaptive thermogenesis as the result of caloric restriction with a high protein very low calorie diet (VLCD) and to determine whether DCT would increase post-prandial energy expenditure (PPEE) in response to a 400 kcal/60 g protein liquid test meal. Thirty-three subjects completed an outpatient very low calorie diet (800 kcal/day providing 120 g/day protein) over 4 weeks and were randomly assigned to receive either DCT capsules three times per day (3 mg or 9 mg) or placebo. At baseline and 4 weeks, fasting basal metabolic rate and PPEE were measured in a metabolic hood and fat free mass (FFM) determined using displacement plethysmography (BOD POD). PPEE normalized to FFM was increased significantly in subjects receiving 9 mg/day DCT by comparison to placebo (p < 0.05), but decreases in resting metabolic rate were not affected. Respiratory quotient (RQ) increased by 0.04 in the placebo group (p < 0.05) at end of the 4 weeks, but did not change in groups receiving DCT. These data provide evidence for postprandial increases in thermogenesis and fat oxidation secondary to administration of dihydrocapsiate. clinicaltrial.govNCT01142687.",

    "abstract": "Animal studies indicate a prominent role of brain insulin signaling in the regulation of peripheral energy metabolism. We determined the effect of intranasal insulin, which directly targets the brain, on glucose metabolism and energy expenditure in humans. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, balanced within-subject comparison, 19 healthy normal-weight men (18-26 years old) were intranasally administered 160 IU human insulin after an overnight fast. Energy expenditure assessed via indirect calorimetry and blood concentrations of glucose, insulin, C-peptide, and free fatty acids (FFAs) were measured before and after insulin administration and the subsequent consumption of a high-calorie liquid meal of 900 kcal. Intranasal insulin, compared with placebo, increased postprandial energy expenditure, i.e., diet-induced thermogenesis, and decreased postprandial concentrations of circulating insulin and C-peptide, whereas postprandial plasma glucose concentrations did not differ from placebo values. Intranasal insulin also induced a transient decrease in prandial serum FFA levels. Enhancing brain insulin signaling by means of intranasal insulin administration enhances the acute thermoregulatory and glucoregulatory response to food intake, suggesting that central nervous insulin contributes to the control of whole-body energy homeostasis in humans.",

    "abstract": "We aimed to distinguish mineralocorticoid (MR) from glucocorticoid receptor (GR) actions in the nutritional differences between the Fischer 344 (F344) and LOU/C (LOU) rat strains. The decrease of urinary Na+/K+ ratio induced via MR activation by aldosterone and decrease of circulating lymphocyte counts exerted via GR activation by dexamethasone revealed a higher efficiency of corticosteroid receptor in LOU than in F344 rats. Afterward, we submitted F344 and LOU male rats to adrenalectomy and to substitution treatments with agonists of MR or GR under 3 successive diets--standard, free choice between chow and pork lard, and an imposed high-fat/high-sugar diet--to explore the involvement of the interactions between activation of corticosteroid receptors and diet on food intake, body composition, and metabolic blood parameters in these rats. Lastly, we measured energy expenditure and substrate oxidization in various experimental conditions in LOU and F344 rats by indirect calorimetry. In LOU rats, we showed greater basal and MR-induced energy expenditure, diet-induced thermogenesis, and lipid oxidization. We showed that the F344 rat strain constitutes a relevant model of the unfavorable effects exerted by glucocorticoids via GR on food preference for high-calorie diets, abdominal fat deposition, diabetes, and other deleterious consequences of visceral obesity. Contrary to F344 rats, the LOU rats did not exhibit the expected visceral fat deposition linked to GR activation. This strain is therefore a relevant model of resistance to diet-induced obesity and to the deleterious effects exerted by glucocorticoids on metabolism.",

    "abstract": "As obesity and its related health problems grow around the world, efforts to control and manage weight is increasing in importance. It is well known that altering and maintaining weight is problematic and this has led to specific studies trying to determine the cause of the difficulty. Recent research has identified that the body reacts to forced weight change by adapting individual total energy expenditure. Key factors are an adaptation of resting metabolic rate, non-exercise activity thermogenesis and dietary induced thermogenesis. We develop a differential equation model based on the first law of thermodynamics that incorporates all three adjustments along with natural age related reduction of the resting metabolic rate. Forward time simulations of the model compare well with mean data in both overfeeding and calorie restriction studies.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the effects of mild calorie restriction (CR) (5%) on body weight, body composition, energy expenditure, feeding behavior, and locomotor activity in female C57BL/6J mice. Mice were subjected to a 5% reduction of food intake relative to baseline intake of ad libitum (AL) mice for 3 or 4 weeks. In experiment 1, body weight was monitored weekly and body composition (fat and lean mass) was determined at weeks 0, 2, and 4 by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. In experiment 2, body weight was measured every 3 days and body composition was determined by quantitative magnetic resonance weekly, and energy expenditure, feeding behavior, and locomotor activity were determined over 3 weeks in a metabolic chamber. At the end of both experiments, CR mice had greater fat mass (P < 0.01) and less lean mass (P < 0.01) compared with AL mice. Total energy expenditure (P < 0.05) and resting energy expenditure (P < 0.05) were significantly decreased in CR mice compared with AL mice over 3 weeks. CR mice ate significantly more food than AL mice immediately following daily food provisioning at 1600 hours (P < 0.01). These findings showed that mild CR caused increased fat mass, decreased lean mass and energy expenditure, and altered feeding behavior in female C57BL/6J mice. Locomotor activity or brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenic capacity did not appear to contribute to the decrease in energy expenditure. The increase in fat mass and decrease in lean mass may be a stress response to the uncertainty of food availability.",

    "abstract": "Weight loss leads to reduced resting energy expenditure (REE) independent of fat-free mass (FFM) and fat mass (FM) loss, but the effect of changes in FFM composition is unclear. We hypothesized that a decrease in REE adjusted for FFM with weight loss would be partly explained by a disproportionate loss in the high metabolic activity component of FFM. Forty-five overweight and obese women [body mass index (in kg/m(2)): 28.7-46.8] aged 22-46 y followed a low-calorie diet for 12.7 +/- 2.2 wk. Body composition was measured by magnetic resonance imaging, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and a 4-compartment model. REE measured by indirect calorimetry (REEm) was compared with REE calculated from detailed body-composition analysis (REEc) by using specific organ metabolic rates (ie, organ REE/mass). Weight loss was 9.5 +/- 3.4 kg (8.0 +/- 2.9 kg FM and 1.5 +/- 3.1 kg FFM). Decreases in REE (-8%), free triiodothyronine concentrations (-8%), muscle (-3%), heart (-5%), liver (-4%), and kidney mass (-6%) were observed (all P < 0.05). Relative loss in organ mass was significantly higher (P < 0.01) than was the change in low metabolically active FFM components (muscle, bone, and residual mass). After weight loss, REEm - REEc decreased from 0.24 +/- 0.58 to 0.01 +/- 0.44 MJ/d (P = 0.01) and correlated with the decrease in free triiodothyronine concentrations (r = 0.33, P < 0.05). Women with high adaptive thermogenesis (defined as REEm - REEc < -0.17 MJ/d) had less weight loss and conserved FFM, liver, and kidney mass. After weight loss, almost 50% of the decrease in REEm was explained by losses in FFM and FM. The variability in REEm explained by body composition increased to 60% by also considering the weight of individual organs.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is currently a worldwide pandemic. It affects more than 300 million humans and it will probably increase over the next 20 years. The consumption of calorie-rich foods is responsible for most of the obesity cases, but not all humans exposed to high-calorie diets develop the disease. This fact has prompted researchers to investigate the mechanisms linking the consumption of high-calorie diets to the generation of an imbalance between energy intake and expenditure. According to recent studies, the exposure to fat-rich diets induces an inflammatory response in the hypothalamic areas involved in the control of feeding and thermogenesis. The inflammatory process damages the neuronal circuitries that maintain the homeostatic control of the body's energy stores, therefore favoring body mass gain. This review will focus on the main advances obtained in this field.",

This analysis sought to evaluate differences between DXALST and FFAT-corrected LST (FFATLST) amongst varied populations and interventions to understand application of the correction formula on LST outcomes. 226 subjects were analyzed across five prior studies. Three studies evaluated combined nutrition and exercise (high-intensity interval training [HIIT] or high-intensity resistance training [HIRT]) interventions, including HIIT + HIRT with pre- and post-nutrient timing (HIITRT), HIIT + essential amino acids (HIITAA), and HIRT + protein (HIRTPRO). Remaining studies evaluated HIIT (HIITOW) and protein following bariatric surgery (BARPRO). Pre and post total body DXA scans were used to measure DXALST, body mass, and fat mass (FM). The correction formula was applied to calculate FFATLST. Paired sample t-tests were used to evaluate differences between DXALST and FFATLST change scores (Δ) across all subjects, within each study and intervention. Significant differences between ΔDXALST and ΔFFATLST were observed for BARPRO (mean difference [MD; ΔDXALST-ΔFFATLST] ± standard error [SE]: -3.5 ± 1.2 kg, p < 0.001), as well as HIRTPRO (-0.1 ± 0.2 kg, p = 0.004). When evaluating LST, the FFAT correction may be specifically applicable to cases of significant weight loss (>10% of original weight) or body recomposition (≥2% FM loss and ≥2% LST gain).",

    "abstract": "The concomitant increase in skeletal muscle mass (SMM) and decrease in fat mass has been termed body recomposition. This study aimed to analyze the influence of pre-training levels of fat mass on body recomposition, muscular strength, and (phase angle) PhA after 24 weeks of resistance training (RT) in older women. Data from 99 older women (68.6 ± 5.7 years, 65.7 ± 8.6 kg, 155.1 ± 5.8 cm, 27.2 ± 3.1 kg/m Results indicated that after the RT period, a greater positive body recomposition was observed in the L-FM group than in M-FM and H-FM groups. Moreover, all groups increased muscular strength and phase angle with no significant difference among groups (P > 0.05). The present study results suggest that the initial amount of fat mass influences the body recomposition induced by RT in older women, with those with lower pre-training fat mass levels presenting higher levels of body recomposition. However, improvements in muscular strength and phase angle are not dependent on the amount of initial fat mass in older women.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this article was to assess the effects of six-week pre-season training on whole-body and regional bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA)-derived parameters, body composition, power, and aerobic performance in professional soccer players. Ten professional soccer athletes participated in the present study. Whole-body and regional hamstrings BIA-derived parameters [resistance, reactance, impedance, phase angle (PhA)], body composition, total body water (TBW), intracellular (ICW), and extracellular (ECW) were measured before, at mid-point, and after sixth week of the pre-season. Power (countermovement jump and squat jump) and aerobic capacity (Yo-Yo test) were measured before and after pre-season. There was a significant increase in the regional PhA (+13.9%) but not in the whole-body. There was a reduction in fat mass (-4.1%), an increase in fat-free mass (+1.7%), TBW (+8.3%), ICW (+8.8%), and ECW (+7.6%), as well as an increase in jump height (+11.0%) and distance covered in the Yo-Yo test (+34.7%). From our results, it is possible to suggest that pre-season training can induce an increase in hamstring PhA as well as body recomposition and improvement of physical fitness in professional soccer players.",

    "title": "Moderate and Higher Protein Intakes Promote Superior Body Recomposition in Older Women Performing Resistance Training.",
    "abstract": "Resistance training (RT) combined with appropriate dietary intake can promote a concomitant increase in skeletal muscle mass (SMM) and reduction in fat mass, a condition termed body recomposition. This study's primary purpose was to explore the effects of protein ingestion on body recomposition after 24 wk of RT in older women. Data from 130 untrained older women (68.7 ± 5.6 yr, 66.5 ± 11.5 kg, 155.5 ± 6.0 cm, and 27.4 ± 4.0 kg·m-2) across six studies were retrospectively analyzed. The participants were divided into tertiles according to their customary protein intake (g·kg-1·d-1): lower (LP; n = 45), moderate (MP; n = 42), and higher (HP; n = 43) protein intake. Participants performed a whole-body RT program carried out over 24 wk (eight exercises, three sets, 8-15 repetitions, three sessions a week). SMM and fat mass were determined by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. All groups increased SMM from baseline (P < 0.05), with the HP and MP groups showing greater increases than the LP group (LP, 2.3%; MP, 5.4%; and HP, 5.1%; P < 0.05). Reductions in fat mass were similar for all three groups (LP, 1.7%; MP, 3.7%; and HP, 3.1%; P > 0.05). The composite z-score of the percentage changes from pretraining to posttraining indicated greater positive body recomposition values for HP and MP compared with LP (P < 0.05). Results suggest that protein intake is a moderating variable for body recomposition in older women undergoing RT, with a low protein intake having a less favorable effect on body recomposition.",

    "abstract": "there is a paradox between the development of strength-power abilities and the high volume of technical/tactical training in elite soccer players during the pre-season. This concurrent effect between aerobic and neuromuscular training regimes induce impairment in power performance. this study aimed to investigate the effect of an equalized program of strength-power training (4-5 sessions/week) and soccer training (4-6 sessions/week) in power and aerobic performance during 8-weeks of pre-season in elite women soccer players. Vertical jumps [squat jump (SJ); countermovement jump (CMJ)] and Yo-Yo intermittent recovery level 1 test (YOYO-R1) were assessed pre- and post pre-season. A paired sample t-test was used to compare differences between pre and post pre-season (Δ%). The level of significance was established at p ≤ 0.05. the women soccer players improved the SJ (p<0.001; Δ%=12), CMJ (p<0.001; Δ%=8.5), and YOYO-R1 (p<0.001; Δ% =28.5). There was a body recomposition observed, lower body fat (p = 0.004; Δ%=15), higher fat free mass (p = 0.001; Δ%=5). our results demonstrated that it is possible to develop aerobic and power abilities of elite women soccer players during pre-season using an equalized ratio of soccer training and strength-power training schedules.",
