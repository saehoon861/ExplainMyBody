    "abstract": "We sought to determine if pre-intervention bone characteristics measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) were associated with changes in bone-free lean tissue mass following a period of resistance training in a large cohort of untrained adults (n = 119, 62M/57F, 26.0 ± 4.7 kg/m Participants completed 10-12 weeks of supervised whole-body resistance training twice weekly, and DXA scans were obtained approximately the same time of day prior to the intervention and 48-72 h following the final training bout. Associations between baseline skeletal measures (e.g., appendicular bone characteristics, shoulder and hip widths) and training induced changes in appendicular lean mass were examined by estimating correlations between participant-level random slopes (reflecting change over time) and baseline skeletal measures. The same approach was used to evaluate associations between other participant attributes (e.g., age, training volume-load, self-reported energy intake) and appendicular lean tissue mass changes. Modeling was also used to explore whether baseline skeletal characteristics (e.g., shoulder and hip widths) moderated the change in appendicular lean tissue mass from training. All analyses used a Bayesian framework, and interpretation focused on estimated effect sizes and their associated credible intervals rather than formal null hypothesis testing. Strong positive associations were observed between pre-intervention characteristics including dual-arm lean tissue mass and dual-arm bone mineral content ( These provide limited evidence suggesting pre-training bone characteristics do not influence lean tissue mass adaptations to shorter-term resistance training.",

    "title": "The Role of Mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) and Adenosine Monophosphate-Activated Protein Kinase (AMPK) Signaling in Skeletal Muscle Hypertrophy: A Literature Review With Implications for Health and Disease.",
    "abstract": "Maintaining skeletal muscle mass is fundamental not only for strength and mobility but also for metabolic health, disease prevention, and healthy aging. Skeletal muscle functions as a dynamic metabolic organ, and its maintenance depends on the delicate equilibrium between mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), which drives anabolic processes, such as protein synthesis and hypertrophy, and adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which promotes catabolic renewal through mitochondrial biogenesis, autophagy, and energy conservation. Sustained mTOR hyperactivation contributes to obesity, insulin resistance, neurodegeneration, and cancer, while AMPK activation counterbalances these effects by restoring cellular energy balance and enhancing metabolic resilience. Thus, optimal muscle and metabolic health depend not on dominance of one pathway, but on the strategic balance between mTOR and AMPK activity. Human trials and meta-analyses show that for individuals engaged in resistance training, a total protein intake of approximately 1.6 g/kg/day effectively maximizes muscle protein synthesis, with diminishing returns beyond that level. Distributing protein evenly across meals enhances anabolic efficiency, about 0.25 g/kg per meal in younger adults and 0.40 g/kg per meal in older adults, which helps overcome age-related anabolic resistance. Protein quality is equally critical: leucine-rich, rapidly absorbed sources such as whey elicit the most robust mTOR activation and muscle-building response. Exercise mode and energy timing further shape this anabolic-catabolic balance. Concurrent endurance and resistance training may attenuate hypertrophy depending on session order, intensity, and training status, whereas intermittent fasting and time-restricted feeding improve body composition and cardiometabolic health when total energy and protein needs are still met. Together, these findings suggest that integrating structured resistance exercise, well-distributed, high-quality protein intake, and periodic AMPK activation through fasting or aerobic training provides a practical framework for sustaining muscle mass, optimizing metabolic function, and promoting longevity.",

To clarify GLP-1RAs' effects on skeletal muscle tissue, body composition and physical function by reviewing preclinical and clinical evidence. Across randomized and controlled studies, GLP-1RAs reduce fat mass more than lean body mass. Functional measures appear preserved. Preclinical and early clinical data suggest improvements in muscle quality (microvascular recruitment, mitochondrial efficiency, reduced intramuscular fat) rather than hypertrophy. GLP-1RA-induced weight loss is largely fat mass with modest absolute lean body mass decline and no consistent deterioration in strength or function. Progressive resistance training, adequate/high-quality protein and periodic monitoring of body composition and performance should accompany therapy, especially in higher-risk patients.",

    "abstract": "Increasing concerns surrounding the environmental impact of animal- and plant-derived proteins warrants further investigations of alternative protein sources and their efficacy for supporting skeletal muscle anabolism. Herein, the postprandial amino acid bioavailability of a novel protein derived from recombinant bovine β-lactoglobulin (rBLG) was determined, alongside the muscle adaptive response to resistance exercise (RE) with rBLG, compared with dairy-derived whey (WHEY). Healthy adults ( n = 8; age: 24 ± 4 yr; BMI: 23.5 ± 2.1 kg·m 2 ) completed a randomized crossover study and ingested 0.3 g·kg -1 ·body mass -1 of rBLG or WHEY with arterialized blood sampled in the fasted state and 240 min postprandially for measurement of plasma amino acid concentrations via UPLC-MS. In a separate double-blind randomized parallel group design, 24 healthy adults completed thrice-weekly lower-body RE for 8 wk, with twice daily supplementation of 0.3 g·kg -1 ·body mass -1 rBLG ( n = 12; age: 23 ± 6 yr; BMI: 25.6 ± 3.4 kg·m 2 ) or WHEY ( n = 12; age: 25 ± 6 yr; BMI 25.1 ± 3.1 kg·m 2 ). Training-induced changes in muscle strength and DEXA-derived leg lean body mass (LBM) were assessed. Plasma essential amino acid concentrations increased after protein ingestion ( P < 0.001), but did not differ between trials ( P = 0.554). Mean plasma leucine incremental area under curve was greater following rBLG compared with WHEY (mean diff, 10727; 95% confidence interval, 7738-13716) μmol·240 min·L -1 ; P < 0.001).

Training volume and daily protein intake did not differ between groups ( P > 0.05 for all).

Is there a minimum protein intake associated with resistance training to optimize skeletal muscle mass gains in untrained older women? J Strength Cond Res 39(7): 730-735, 2025-This study explored the relationship between habitual total daily protein intake and its effects on skeletal muscle mass (SMM) and body fat mass in a group of healthy, physically independent older women participating in resistance training (RT). The data were retrospectively analyzed from 97 previously untrained older women (age: 68.6 ± 6.3 years; mass: 65.7 ± 11.8 kg; height: 155.2 ± 6.0 cm; body mass index: 27.2 ± 4.3 kg·m -2 ). Subjects were engaged in a whole-body RT program for 24 weeks, which consisted of 8 exercises performed in 3 sets of 8-15 repetitions 3 times a week. The SMM and body fat mass were determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, while food consumption was evaluated using the 24-hour dietary recall method. A positive correlation was found between daily protein intake (g·kg -1 ·d -1 ) and changes in SMM ( r = 0.23, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.03-0.41; p = 0.022). Furthermore, segmented regression analyses revealed a significant positive relationship between daily protein intake and SMM changes ( β = 1.34; p = 0.007), with an estimated breakpoint approximately 1.1 g·kg -1 ·d -1 (95% CI: 0.9-1.3). However, according to linear regression and biphasic linear regression models, there was no significant relationship between body fat mass changes and daily protein intake ( p > 0.05). Our results suggest that a habitual protein intake of approximately 1.1 g·kg -1 ·d -1 associated with RT may be necessary to optimize gains in SMM in untrained older women.",

    "abstract": "Dietary supplements have improved performance and muscle hypertrophy in athletes and nonathletes in the past few decades. Theracurmin, a nutraceutical supplement based on curcumin, has been highlighted by its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties in physiological and pathological conditions. This study aimed to investigate the effects of theracurmin intake (300 mg/kg), containing 30 mg/kg of curcumin, in male Swiss mice (n = 66) under distinct protocols of climbing stairs (strength exercise) and their respective detraining period. Animals, aged 7-9 weeks, were trained for 8 weeks (5 days/week), with a minimum interval of 24 hr between each session, followed by a 4-week detraining period. After euthanasia, skeletal muscle hypertrophy was evaluated through histological analysis. Tissue inflammatory release of tumor necrosis factor, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, and chemokine C-C motif ligand 2, as well as the activity of oxidative stress enzymes (catalase, superoxide dismutase, and lipid peroxidation), were also assessed. In trained animals, inflammatory mediators and skeletal muscle mass increased after training (p = .0004). Theracurmin did not revert the muscle hypertrophy, but it decreased tissue chemokine C-C motif ligand 2 (p = .0001) and lipid peroxidation (p < .0001) after strength training and after detraining (p = .0008 and p = .001, respectively). Tissue tumor necrosis factor was only reduced during the detraining period (p = .037), whereas IL-6 (p = .0001) and IL-10 (p < .0001) increased after the training protocol. No differences were observed in catalase and superoxide dismutase. Our data suggest that theracurmin intake contributes to the reduction of tissue inflammatory mediators during strength training and/or detraining without essential activity on skeletal muscle hypertrophy.",

    "title": "Skeletal Muscle Memory: An Update From the Antidoping Perspective.",
    "abstract": "This narrative review explores the concept of muscle memory, focusing on the physiological and biochemical mechanisms underlying information retention in skeletal muscle tissue as it relates to antidoping. The discussion encompasses the role of satellite cells (SCs) in myonuclei recruitment, resulting in increased myonuclear density and heightened muscle protein turnover. The myonuclear domain theory suggests that myonuclei acquired during hypertrophy may persist, contributing to enhanced muscle protein synthesis (MPS) and potential benefits of muscle memory. The impact of sustained training, protein intake, and resistance exercise on muscle memory, especially in elite athletes, is considered. The review also delves into the influence of anabolic androgenic steroids (AAS) on muscle tissue, highlighting their role in elevating the performance threshold and supporting recovery during intense training through increased muscle protein turnover rates. Additionally, genetic and epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, are explored as potential contributors to muscle memory. The complex interplay of continuous training, AAS use, and genetic factors offers avenues for further research, especially in the context of antidoping efforts. The understanding of muscle memory has implications for maintaining performance gains and addressing ethical challenges in sports.",

    "title": "Evidence for Simultaneous Muscle Atrophy and Hypertrophy in Response to Resistance Training in Humans.",
    "abstract": "Human skeletal muscle has the profound ability to hypertrophy in response to resistance training (RT). However, this has a high energy and protein cost and is presumably mainly restricted to recruited muscles. It remains largely unknown what happens with nonrecruited muscles during RT. This study investigated the volume changes of 17 recruited and 13 nonrecruited muscles during a 10-wk single-joint RT program targeting upper arm and upper leg musculature. Muscle volume changes were measured by manual or automatic 3D segmentation in 21 RT novices. Subjects ate ad libitum during the study and energy and protein intake were assessed by self-reported diaries. Posttraining, all recruited muscles increased in volume (range: +2.2% to +17.7%, P < 0.05), whereas the nonrecruited adductor magnus (mean: -1.5% ± 3.1%, P = 0.038) and soleus (-2.4% ± 2.3%, P = 0.0004) decreased in volume. Net muscle growth ( r = 0.453, P = 0.045) and changes in adductor magnus volume ( r = 0.450, P = 0.047) were positively associated with protein intake. Changes in total nonrecruited muscle volume ( r = 0.469, P = 0.037), adductor magnus ( r = 0.640, P = 0.002), adductor longus ( r = 0.465, P = 0.039), and soleus muscle volume ( r = 0.481, P = 0.032) were positively related to energy intake. When subjects were divided into a HIGH or LOW energy intake group, overall nonrecruited muscle volume (-1.7% ± 2.0%), adductor longus (-5.6% ± 3.7%), adductor magnus (-2.8% ± 2.4%), and soleus volume (-3.7% ± 1.8%) decreased significantly ( P < 0.05) in the LOW but not the HIGH group. To our knowledge, this is the first study documenting that some nonrecruited muscles significantly atrophy during a period of RT. Our data therefore suggest muscle mass reallocation, that is, that hypertrophy in recruited muscles takes place at the expense of atrophy in nonrecruited muscles, especially when energy and protein availability are limited.",

    "abstract": "Despite increasing awareness of plant-based diets for health and athletic performance, athletes are cautioned that careful dietary monitoring is necessary. Whether commonly consumed plant-based diets are nutritionally adequate for maximal muscular hypertrophy remains unknown. This modeling study assessed the nutrient composition of completely plant-based diets scaled to the caloric demands of maximal muscle mass and strength development in adult male bodybuilders. To model calorie requirements, anthropometric data from bodybuilders were input into the Tinsley resting metabolic rate prediction equation, and an appropriate physical activity factor and calorie surplus were applied. Dietary data from a large cohort following completely plant-based diets were then scaled to meet these needs. Modeled intakes for nutrients of interest were calculated as 1.8 g/kg/day of protein and 2.75 g/meal of leucine, which surpass mean requirements for maximal increases in muscle mass and strength and muscle protein synthesis, respectively. Daily levels for all micronutrients, except vitamin D, also exceeded requirements. Saturated fat levels were aligned with dietary guidelines, although sodium levels exceeded recommended limits. Consumption of larger portions of commonplace plant-based diets, scaled to meet the energy demands of maximal accrual of muscle mass and strength, satisfied protein and leucine requirements without the need for additional planning.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of the study was to identify potential predictors of muscle hypertrophy responsiveness following neuromuscular electrical stimulation resistance training (NMES-RT) in persons with chronic spinal cord injury (SCI). Data for twenty individuals with motor complete SCI who completed twice weekly NMES-RT lasting 12-16 weeks as part of their participation in one of two separate clinical trials were pooled and retrospectively analyzed. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to measure muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) of the whole thigh and knee extensor muscle before and after NMES-RT. Muscle biopsies and fasting biomarkers were also measured. Following the completion of the respective NMES-RT trials, participants were classified into either high-responders (n = 8; muscle CSA > 20%) or low-responders (n = 12; muscle CSA < 20%) based on whole thigh muscle CSA hypertrophy. Whole thigh muscle and knee extensors CSAs were significantly greater (P < 0.0001) in high-responders (29 ± 7% and 47 ± 15%, respectively) compared to low-responders (12 ± 3% and 19 ± 6%, respectively). There were no differences in total caloric intake or macronutrient intake between groups. Extensor spasticity was lower in the high-responders compared to the low-responders as was the dosage of baclofen. Prior to the intervention, the high-responders had greater body mass compared to the low-responders with SCI (87.8 ± 13.7 vs. 70.4 ± 15.8 kg; P = 0.012), body mass index (BMI: 27.6 ± 2.7 vs. 22.9 ± 6.0 kg/m",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to examine whether antioxidant vitamin supplementation with vitamin C (VitC) and vitamin E (VitE) affects the hypertrophic and functional adaptations to resistance training in trained men. This was a double-blind, randomized controlled trial in which participants were supplemented daily with VitC and VitE ( n = 12) or placebo ( n = 11) while completing a 10-wk resistance training program accompanied by a dietary intervention (300 kcal surplus and adequate protein intake) designed to optimize hypertrophy. Body composition (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry), handgrip strength, and one-repetition maximum (1-RM), maximal force (F0), velocity (V0), and power (Pmax) were measured in bench press (BP) and squat (SQ) tests conducted before and after the intervention. To detect between-group differences, multiple-mixed analysis of variance, standardized differences, and qualitative differences were estimated. Relative changes within each group were assessed using a paired Student's t test. In both groups, similar improvements were produced in BP 1-RM , SQ 1-RM SQ, and BP F0 (P < 0.05) after the resistance training program. A small effect size was observed for BP 1-RM (d = 0.53), BP F0 (d = 0.48), and SQ 1-RM (d = -0.39), but not for SQ F0 (d = 0.03). Dominant handgrip strength was significantly increased only in the placebo group (P < 0.05). According to body composition data, a significant increase was produced in upper body fat-free mass soft tissue (FFMST; P < 0.05) in the placebo group, whereas neither total nor segmental FFMST was increased in the vitamin group. Small intervention effect sizes were observed for upper body FFSMT (d = 0.32), non-dominant and dominant leg FFMST (d = -0.39; d = -0.42). Although a significant increase in total body fat was observed in both groups (P < 0.05) only the placebo group showed an increase in visceral adipose tissue (P < 0.05), showing a substantial intervention effect (d = 0.85). The data indicated that, although VitC/VitE supplementation seemed to blunt upper body strength and hypertrophy adaptations to resistance training, it could also mitigate gains in visceral adipose tissue elicited by an energy surplus.",

    "abstract": "Many studies have evaluated the effects of resistance training (RT) and protein intake to attenuate the age-related loss of skeletal muscle. However, the effects of graded protein intake with conjunctive RT in older adults are unclear. Older adults (n = 18) performed 10 weeks of whole-body RT with progressions to intensity and volume while consuming either a constant protein (CP) diet (0.8−1.0 g/kg/d) with no protein supplement or a graded protein (GP) diet progressing from 0.8 g/kg/d at week 1 to 2.2 g/kg/d at week 10 with a whey protein supplement. Data were collected prior to commencement of the RT protocol (PRE), after week 5 (MID), and after week 10 (POST). Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry derived lean/soft tissue mass, ultrasonography derived muscle thickness, and a proxy of muscle quality were taken at PRE and POST, while isokinetic dynamometry derived peak torque were taken at PRE, MID, and POST. This study demonstrated the feasibility of the RT protocol (attendance = 96%), and protein intake protocol (CP in range all weeks; GP deviation from prescribed = 7%). Peak torque, muscle quality scores, and appendicular lean/soft tissue mass demonstrated the main effects of time (p < 0.05) while no other main effects of time or group * time interactions were seen for any measure. In conclusion, RT improved appendicular lean/soft tissue mass, peak torque, and muscle quality, with no differential effects of graded or constant protein intake.",

    "title": "Weight Gain Recommendations for Athletes and Military Personnel: a Critical Review of the Evidence.",
    "abstract": "Sports nutrition guidelines typically state that athletes desiring weight gain follow a regimen that includes increasing energy intake by ~ 300-500 kcal/day with an emphasis on adequate protein and carbohydrate and judicious inclusion of energy-dense foods, in combination with rigorous resistance training. This regimen is thought to promote weekly gains of ~ 0.45 kg (1 lb), mostly as lean body mass (LBM). This review summarizes the evidence supporting these intentional weight gain regimens in athletes. Although some research has been conducted in the past 5 years, research on intentional weight gain is lacking. Currently, available data suggests that weekly weight gain of 0.45 kg (1 lb), primarily as LBM, may be difficult for some athletes to achieve. Available evidence, however, suggests that commonly recommended strategies to promote calorie surplus, including consuming larger portions, incorporating energy-dense foods, and prioritizing liquid over solid foods, may prove helpful.",

    "title": "Relationship between protein intake and resistance training-induced muscle hypertrophy in middle-aged women: A pilot study.",
    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to observe the relationship of protein intake at each meal and daily total with change in lean tissue mass with progressive resistance exercise training (RET) in healthy middle-aged women. Twenty-two healthy Japanese women were recruited from Shiga Prefecture, Japan, and a supervised whole body RET program was conducted twice a week for 16 wk. The dietary intake was assessed using 3-d dietary records. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry was used to measure the whole body lean soft tissue mass (WLTM). Multiple regression analysis was performed to examine the relationship between the protein intake and RET-induced changes in the WLTM after adjusting for age, sleep quality, physical activity, and energy intake. The 16-wk RET program caused a significant gain in the WLTM (1.46 ± 0.45%, P = 0.004). Multiple regression analysis showed that the baseline protein intake at breakfast was negatively associated with the percent change in the WLTM (β = -1.598; P = 0.022). Additionally, the percent change (β = 0.624; P = 0.018) in protein intake at breakfast was positively associated with the percent change in WLTM. Increasing protein intake at breakfast may contribute to RET-induced muscle hypertrophy in middle-aged women, especially among those who habitually consume low-protein levels at breakfast. However, future studies with larger sample sizes are required to confirm the importance of protein intake at breakfast.",

    "title": "Evaluating the Effects of Increased Protein Intake on Muscle Strength, Hypertrophy and Power Adaptations with Concurrent Training: A Narrative Review.",
    "abstract": "Concurrent training incorporates dual exercise modalities, typically resistance and aerobic-based exercise, either in a single session or as part of a periodized training program, that can promote muscle strength, mass, power/force and aerobic capacity adaptations for the purposes of sports performance or general health/wellbeing. Despite multiple health and exercise performance-related benefits, diminished muscle hypertrophy, strength and power have been reported with concurrent training compared to resistance training in isolation. Dietary protein is well-established to facilitate skeletal muscle growth, repair and regeneration during recovery from exercise. The degree to which increased protein intake can amplify adaptation responses with resistance exercise, and to a lesser extent aerobic exercise, has been highly studied. In contrast, much less focus has been directed toward the capacity for protein to enhance anabolic and metabolic responses with divergent contractile stimuli inherent to concurrent training and potentially negate interference in muscle strength, power and hypertrophy. This review consolidates available literature investigating increased protein intake on rates of muscle protein synthesis, hypertrophy, strength and force/power adaptations following acute and chronic concurrent training. Acute concurrent exercise studies provide evidence for the significant stimulation of myofibrillar protein synthesis with protein compared to placebo ingestion. High protein intake can also augment increases in lean mass with chronic concurrent training, although these increases do not appear to translate into further improvements in strength adaptations. Similarly, the available evidence indicates protein intake twice the recommended intake and beyond does not rescue decrements in selective aspects of muscle force and power production with concurrent training.",

    "abstract": "Increased protein intake is suggested as a strategy to slow or reverse the loss of muscle mass and strength observed in sarcopenia, but results from studies that directly tested this possibility have been inconsistent. We assessed the evidence on the effects of whole protein supplementation or higher-protein diets, without the use of amino acids or supplements known to stimulate hypertrophy, alone or in combination with resistance exercise (RE) interventions, on lean body mass (LBM) and strength in older adults. A systematic search was conducted using PubMed, Medline, Web of Science, and Cochrane CENTRAL databases from January 1990 to July 2021. Randomized controlled trials that assessed the effects of protein supplementation and/or higher-protein dietary interventions in older adults (mean age ≥50 y) on total LBM, appendicular lean mass (ALM), and handgrip (HG) and knee extension (KE) strength were included. Twenty-eight studies were identified. In pooled analysis, compared with lower protein controls, protein supplementation did not have a significant positive effect on total LBM [weighted mean difference in change (WMD): 0.34; 95% CI: -0.21, 0.89; I2 = 90.01%], ALM (WMD: 0.4; 95% CI: -0.01, 0.81; I2 = 90.38%), HG strength (WMD: 0.69; 95% CI: -0.69, 2.06; I2 = 94.52%), or KE strength (WMD: 1.88; 95% CI: -0.6, 4.35; I2 = 95.35%). However, in interventions that used also RE, statistically significant positive effects of protein were observed for ALM (WMD: 0.54; 95% CI: 0.03, 1.05; I2 = 89.76%) and HG (WMD: 1.71; 95% CI: 0.12, 3.30; I2 = 88.71%). Meta-regression revealed no significant association between age, per-meal protein dose, duration, and baseline protein intake with change in any outcome. Subgroup analysis revealed the statistically significant effects on ALM occurred only in sarcopenic/frail populations (WMD: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.51, 1.25; I2 = 79.0%). Most studies (n = 22) had some risk of bias. In older adults performing RE, increased protein intake leads to greater ALM and HG strength compared with lower protein controls. Without RE, protein has no additional benefit on changes in total LBM, ALM, or HG strength.",

    "title": "Effects of Combining a Ketogenic Diet with Resistance Training on Body Composition, Strength, and Mechanical Power in Trained Individuals: A Narrative Review.",
    "abstract": "Ketogenic diets (KD) have gained popularity in recent years among strength-trained individuals. The present review summarizes current evidence-with a particular focus on randomized controlled trials-on the effects of KD on body composition and muscle performance (strength and power output) in strength-trained individuals. Although long-term studies (>12 weeks) are lacking, growing evidence supports the effectiveness of an ad libitum and energy-balanced KD for reducing total body and fat mass, at least in the short term. However, no or negligible benefits on body composition have been observed when comparing hypocaloric KD with conventional diets resulting in the same energy deficit. Moreover, some studies suggest that KD might impair resistance training-induced muscle hypertrophy, sometimes with concomitant decrements in muscle performance, at least when expressed in absolute units and not relative to total body mass (e.g., one-repetition maximum). KD might therefore be a beneficial strategy for promoting fat loss, although it might not be a recommendable option to gain muscle mass and strength/power. More research is needed on the adoption of strategies for avoiding the potentially detrimental effect of KD on muscle mass and strength/power (e.g., increasing protein intake, reintroduction of carbohydrates before competition). In summary, evidence is as yet scarce to support a major beneficial effect of KD on body composition or performance in strength-trained individuals. Furthermore, the long-term effectiveness and safety of this type of diet remains to be determined.",

    "abstract": "Whole egg may have potential benefits for enhancing muscle mass, independent of its protein content. The yolk comprises ∼40% of the total protein in an egg, as well as containing several nonprotein nutrients that could possess anabolic properties (e.g., microRNAs, vitamins, minerals, lipids, phosphatidic acid and other phospholipids). Therefore, the purpose of this narrative review is to discuss the current evidence as to the possible effects of egg yolk compounds on skeletal muscle accretion beyond those of egg whites alone. The intake of whole egg seems to promote greater myofibrillar protein synthesis than egg white intake in young men. However, limited evidence shows no difference in muscle hypertrophy when comparing the consumption of whole egg versus an isonitrogenous quantity of egg white in young men performing resistance training. Although egg yolk intake seems to promote additional acute increases on myofibrillar protein synthesis, it does not seem to further enhance muscle mass when compared to egg whites when consumed as part of a high-protein dietary patterns, at least in young men. This conclusion is based on very limited evidence and more studies are needed to evaluate the effects of egg yolk (or whole eggs) intake on muscle mass not only in young men, but also in other populations such as women, older adults, and individuals with muscle wasting diseases.",

    "abstract": "Skeletal muscle wasting is a frequent clinical problem encountered in patients with chronic diseases. Increased levels of inflammatory markers play a role in the imbalance between muscle protein synthesis and degradation. Although testosterone has long been proposed as a treatment for patients with muscle wasting, undesirable side effects have raised concerns about prostatic hypertrophy in men as well as virilization in women. Selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs) have demonstrated similar results like testosterone at improving lean body mass (LBM) with less side effects on androgen-dependent tissue. This review outlines the ongoing clinical development in the field of SARMs and their effectiveness in improving body composition and physical function. The included articles were collected at pubmed.gov and analyzed integrally. There is an unmet clinical need for safe and effective anabolic compounds such as SARMs. Despite the effect on LBM shown by SARMs in phase II clinical trials, results on improved physical function and muscle strength are still lacking and long-term outcomes have to be assessed in these patients. Moreover, there is a need to determine the effect of resistance exercise training and protein intake associated with SARMs in the treatment of patients with muscle wasting.",

    "title": "Evenly Distributed Protein Intake over 3 Meals Augments Resistance Exercise-Induced Muscle Hypertrophy in Healthy Young Men.",
    "abstract": "Although daily protein intake (PI) has been reported to be essential for regulating muscle mass, the distribution of daily PI in individuals is typically the lowest at breakfast and skewed toward dinner. Skewed protein intake patterns and inadequate PI at breakfast were reported to be negative factors for muscle maintenance. This study examined whether a protein-enriched meal at breakfast is more effective for muscle accretion compared with the typical skewed PI pattern. This 12-wk, parallel-group, randomized clinical trial included 26 men (means ± SEs; age: 20.8 ± 0.4 y; BMI: 21.8 ± 0.4 kg/m2). The \"high breakfast\" (HBR) group (n = 12) consumed a protein-enriched meal at breakfast providing a PI of 0.33 g/kg body weight (BW); their PI at lunch (0.46 g/kg BW) and dinner (0.48 g/kg BW) provided an adequate overall daily PI (1.30 g/kg BW/d). The \"low breakfast\" (LBR) group (n = 14) consumed 0.12 g protein/kg BW at breakfast; intakes at lunch (0.45 g/kg BW) and dinner (0.83 g/kg BW) yielded the same daily PI as in the HBR group. The participants performed supervised resistance training (RT) 3 times per week (75-80% 1-repetition maximum; 3 sets × 10 repetitions). DXA was used to measure the primary outcome variable, that is, total lean soft tissue mass (LTM). The total LTM at baseline did not differ between the HBR (52.4 ± 1.3 kg) and LBR (53.4 ± 1.2 kg) groups. After the intervention, increases in total LTM were significant in both groups, with that in the HBR group (2.5 ± 0.3 kg) tending to be greater than that in the LBR group (1.8 ± 0.3 kg) (P = 0.06), with a large effect size (Cohen d = 0.795). For RT-induced muscle hypertrophy in healthy young men, consuming a protein-enriched meal at breakfast and less protein at dinner while achieving an adequate overall PI is more effective than consuming more protein at dinner.This study was registered at University hospital Medical Information Network (UMIN) Clinical Trials Registry as UMIN000037583 (https://upload.umin.ac.jp/cgi-open-bin/ctr_e/ctr_view.cgi?recptno=R000042763).",

    "abstract": "Skeletal muscle plays a pivotal role in the maintenance of physical and metabolic health and, critically, mobility. Accordingly, strategies focused on increasing the quality and quantity of skeletal muscle are relevant, and resistance exercise is foundational to the process of functional hypertrophy. Much of our current understanding of skeletal muscle hypertrophy can be attributed to the development and utilization of stable isotopically labeled tracers. We know that resistance exercise and sufficient protein intake act synergistically and provide the most effective stimuli to enhance skeletal muscle mass; however, the molecular intricacies that underpin the tremendous response variability to resistance exercise-induced hypertrophy are complex. The purpose of this review is to discuss recent studies with the aim of shedding light on key regulatory mechanisms that dictate hypertrophic gains in skeletal muscle mass. We also aim to provide a brief up-to-date summary of the recent advances in our understanding of skeletal muscle hypertrophy in response to resistance training in humans.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the current study was to determine if 4 weeks of consumption of Bang® Pre-Workout Master Blaster® (BMB; Vital Pharmaceuticals Inc., Weston, FL) combined with resistance training resulted in greater increases in muscle mass and maximal strength compared with resistance training combined with placebo (PLA). Additionally, we aimed to determine if BMB ingestion combined with resistance training preferentially altered resting skeletal muscle expression of microRNAs (miRs) or resting serum insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1). Sixteen recreationally-active men completed the study. The study employed a block-randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel design. Participants completed two testing sessions separated by 4 weeks of resistance exercise combined with daily supplementation of BMB or PLA. At each testing session, hemodynamics, body composition, and muscle and blood samples were obtained followed by strength assessments of the lower- and upper-body via measurement of squat and bench press one-repetition maximum (1-RM), respectively. A separate general linear model was utilized for analysis of each variable to determine the effect of each supplement (between-factor) over time (within-factor) using an a priori probability level of ≤0.05. No significant effects were observed for dietary intake, hemodynamics, fat mass, body fat percentage, or serum IGF-1. A greater increase in total body mass (3.19 kg, 95% CI, 1.98 kg, 4.40 kg vs. 0.44 kg, 95% CI, - 0.50 kg, 1.39 kg) and lean body mass (3.15 kg, 95% CI, 1.80 kg, 4.49 kg vs. 0.89 kg, 95% CI, - 0.14 kg, 1.93 kg) was observed for the BMB group compared with PLA (p <  0.01). A significant increase over time was observed for miR-23a (p = 0.02) and miR-23b (p = 0.05) expression. A greater increase in squat 1-RM was observed for the BMB group (23.86 kg, 95% CI, 16.75 kg, 30.97 kg) compared with the PLA group (14.20 kg, 95% CI, 7.04 kg, 21.37 kg, p = 0.04). BMB supplementation combined with resistance exercise training for 4 weeks resulted in superior adaptations in maximal strength and LBM compared with resistance training with a placebo. No adverse resting hemodynamic or clinical blood safety markers were observed as a result of BMB supplementation. The superior outcomes associated with BMB supplementation could not be explained by resting serum IGF-1 or the skeletal muscle miRs measured, although resting miR-23a and miR-23b expression both increased as a result of resistance training.",

    "title": "Maximizing Post-exercise Anabolism: The Case for Relative Protein Intakes.",
    "abstract": "Maximizing the post-exercise increase in muscle protein synthesis, especially of the contractile myofibrillar protein fraction, is essential to facilitate effective muscle remodeling, and enhance hypertrophic gains with resistance training. MPS is the primary regulated variable influencing muscle net balance with dietary amino acid ingestion representing the single most important nutritional variable enhancing post-exercise rates of muscle protein synthesis. Dose-response studies in average (i.e., ~80 kg) males have reported an absolute 20 g dose of high quality, rapidly digested protein maximizes mixed, and myofibrillar protein synthetic rates. However, it is unclear if these absolute protein intakes can be viewed in a \"one size fits all\" solution. Re-analysis of published literature in young adults suggests a relative single meal intake of ~0.31 g/kg of rapidly digested, high quality protein (i.e., whey) should be considered as a nutritional guideline for individuals of average body composition aiming to maximize post-exercise myofibrillar protein synthesis while minimizing irreversible amino acid oxidative catabolism that occurs with excessive intakes of this macronutrient. This muscle-specific bolus intake is lower than that reported to maximize whole body anabolism (i.e., ≥0.5 g/kg). Review of the available literature suggests that potential confounders such as the co-ingestion of carbohydrate, sex, and amount of active muscle mass do not represent significant barriers to the translation of this objectively determined relative protein intake. Additional research is warranted to elucidate the effective dose for proteins with suboptimal amino acid compositions (e.g., plant-based), and/or slower digestion rates as well as whether recommendations are appreciably affected by other physiological conditions such endurance exercise, high habitual daily protein ingestion, aging, obesity, and/or periods of chronic negative energy balance.",

    "abstract": "Ketogenic diet (KD) is a nutritional regimen characterized by a high-fat and an adequate protein content and a very low carbohydrate level (less than 20 g per day or 5% of total daily energy intake). The insufficient level of carbohydrates forces the body to primarily use fat instead of sugar as a fuel source. Due to its characteristic, KD has often been used to treat metabolic disorders, obesity, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes. Skeletal muscle constitutes 40% of total body mass and is one of the major sites of glucose disposal. KD is a well-defined approach to induce weight loss, with its role in muscle adaptation and muscle hypertrophy less understood. Considering this lack of knowledge, the aim of this review was to examine the scientific evidence about the effects of KD on muscle hypertrophy. We first described the mechanisms of muscle hypertrophy per se, and secondly, we discussed the characteristics and the metabolic function of KD. Ultimately, we provided the potential mechanism that could explain the influence of KD on skeletal muscle hypertrophy.",

    "title": "Isolated branched-chain amino acid intake and muscle protein synthesis in humans: a biochemical review.",
    "abstract": "Alongside a proper diet, ergogenic aids with potential direct and/or indirect physical performance enhancing effects are sought after for improved adaptation to physical training. Nutritional ergogenics include diet composition changes and/or dietary supplementation. Branched-chain amino acids valine, leucine and isoleucine are widely popular among products with ergogenic claims. Their major marketing appeal derives from allegations that branched-chain amino acids intake combined with resistance physical exercise stimulates muscle protein synthesis. Evidence supporting the efficacy of branched-chain amino acids alone for muscle hypertrophy in humans is somewhat equivocal. This brief review describes physiological and biochemical mechanisms underpinning the effects of complete protein source and branched-chain amino acid intake on skeletal muscle growth in the postabsorptive and post-exercise state. Evidence in favor of or against potential anabolic effects of isolated branched-chain amino acid intake on muscle protein synthesis in humans is also examined. No treinamento físico, buscam-se, além de uma dieta adequada, recursos ergogênicos que possam maximizar direta e/ou indiretamente o desempenho físico. Entre as categorias de recursos ergogênicos, o nutricional compreende a modulação da composição dietética e/ou uso de suplementação. A comercialização dos suplementos de aminoácidos de cadeia ramificada valina, leucina e isoleucina possui muita popularidade entre aqueles com alegação ergogênica. O principal marketing está na afirmação de que o consumo isolado de aminoácidos de cadeia ramificada associado ao exercício físico resistido estimula a síntese de proteína muscular. As evidências da eficácia da ingestão isolada de aminoácidos de cadeia ramificada para a hipertrofia muscular em humanos parecem equivocadas. Nesta breve revisão, apresentamos a compreensão fisiológica e bioquímica de como a ingestão de uma fonte completa de proteína e de aminoácidos de cadeia ramificada afeta o crescimento do músculo esquelético no estado pós-absortivo e pós-exercício. Mostramos também as evidências que suportam ou não a afirmação dos potenciais efeitos anabólicos na síntese de proteína muscular dos aminoácidos de cadeia ramificada quando consumidos isoladamente em humanos.",

    "title": "Is an Energy Surplus Required to Maximize Skeletal Muscle Hypertrophy Associated With Resistance Training.",
    "abstract": "Resistance training is commonly prescribed to enhance strength/power qualities and is achieved via improved neuromuscular recruitment, fiber type transition, and/ or skeletal muscle hypertrophy. The rate and amount of muscle hypertrophy associated with resistance training is influenced by a wide array of variables including the training program, plus training experience, gender, genetic predisposition, and nutritional status of the individual. Various dietary interventions have been proposed to influence muscle hypertrophy, including manipulation of protein intake, specific supplement prescription, and creation of an energy surplus. While recent research has provided significant insight into optimization of dietary protein intake and application of evidence based supplements, the specific energy surplus required to facilitate muscle hypertrophy is unknown. However, there is clear evidence of an anabolic stimulus possible from an energy surplus, even independent of resistance training. Common textbook recommendations are often based solely on the assumed energy stored within the tissue being assimilated. Unfortunately, such guidance likely fails to account for other energetically expensive processes associated with muscle hypertrophy, the acute metabolic adjustments that occur in response to an energy surplus, or individual nuances like training experience and energy status of the individual. Given the ambiguous nature of these calculations, it is not surprising to see broad ranging guidance on energy needs. These estimates have never been validated in a resistance training population to confirm the \"sweet spot\" for an energy surplus that facilitates optimal rates of muscle gain relative to fat mass. This review not only addresses the influence of an energy surplus on resistance training outcomes, but also explores other pertinent issues, including \"how much should energy intake be increased,\" \"where should this extra energy come from,\" and \"when should this extra energy be consumed.\" Several gaps in the literature are identified, with the hope this will stimulate further research interest in this area. Having a broader appreciation of these issues will assist practitioners in the establishment of dietary strategies that facilitate resistance training adaptations while also addressing other important nutrition related issues such as optimization of fuelling and recovery goals. Practical issues like the management of satiety when attempting to increase energy intake are also addressed.",

    "abstract": "A very limited amount of research has examined intermittent fasting (IF) programs, such as time-restricted feeding (TRF), in active populations. Our objective was to examine the effects of TRF, with or without β-hydroxy β-methylbutyrate (HMB) supplementation, during resistance training (RT). This study employed a randomized, placebo-controlled, reduced factorial design and was double-blind with respect to supplementation in TRF groups. Resistance-trained females were randomly assigned to a control diet (CD), TRF, or TRF plus 3 g/d HMB (TRFHMB). TRF groups consumed all calories between 1200 h and 2000 h, whereas the CD group ate regularly from breakfast until the end of the day. All groups completed 8 wk of supervised RT and consumed supplemental whey protein. Body composition, muscular performance, dietary intake, physical activity, and physiological variables were assessed. Data were analyzed prior to unblinding using mixed models and both intention-to-treat (ITT) and per protocol (PP) frameworks. Forty participants were included in ITT, and 24 were included in PP. Energy and protein intake (1.6 g/kg/d) did not differ between groups despite different feeding durations (TRF and TRFHMB: ∼7.5 h/d; CD: ∼13 h/d). Comparable fat-free mass (FFM) accretion (+2% to 3% relative to baseline) and skeletal muscle hypertrophy occurred in all groups. Differential effects on fat mass (CD: +2%; TRF: -2% to -4%; TRFHMB: -4% to -7%) were statistically significant in the PP analysis, but not ITT. Muscular performance improved without differences between groups. No changes in physiological variables occurred in any group, and minimal side effects were reported. IF, in the form of TRF, did not attenuate RT adaptations in resistance-trained females. Similar FFM accretion, skeletal muscle hypertrophy, and muscular performance improvements can be achieved with dramatically different feeding programs that contain similar energy and protein content during RT. Supplemental HMB during fasting periods of TRF did not definitively improve outcomes. This study was prospectively registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03404271.",

    "title": "Should Competitive Bodybuilders Ingest More Protein than Current Evidence-Based Recommendations?",
    "abstract": "Bodybuilding is an aesthetic sport whereby competitors aspire to achieve a combination of high levels of muscularity combined with low levels of body fat. Protein is an important macronutrient for promoting muscle growth, and meeting daily needs is necessary to optimize the accretion of lean mass. Current recommendations for muscle hypertrophy suggest a relative protein intake ranging from 1.4 g/kg/day up to 2.0 g/kg/day is required for those involved in resistance training. However, research indicates that the actual ingestion of protein in competitive bodybuilders is usually greater than advocated in guidelines. The purpose of this current opinion article is to critically evaluate the evidence on whether higher intakes of protein are warranted in competitive bodybuilders. We conclude that competitive bodybuilders may benefit from consuming a higher protein intake than what is generally prescribed for recreationally trained lifters; however, the paucity of direct research in this population makes it difficult to draw strong conclusions on the topic.",

    "title": "Effects of higher habitual protein intake on resistance-training-induced changes in body composition and muscular strength in untrained older women: A clinical trial study.",
    "abstract": "Aging is accompanied by progressive and accentuated decline in muscular strength and skeletal muscle mass, affecting health and functional autonomy. Both resistance training (RT) and diet are strategies that may contribute to improvement in the health of the elderly. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of higher habitual protein intake on RT-induced changes in body composition and strength in untrained postmenopausal women. Seventy older women were submitted to an RT program. Body composition, muscular strength, and dietary intake (24 h dietary recall) were performed pre- and post-intervention. To verify different intervention effects according to protein intake of the participants, the sample was separated into tertiles according to protein intake: low, moderate, and high protein intake. A time vs. group interaction ( p < 0.05) was observed, with high protein intake presenting greater increases compared with low protein intake, for skeletal muscle mass (5.3% vs. 1.3%), lower limb lean soft tissue (4.9% vs. 1.4%), upper lean soft tissue (4.9% vs. 1.2%), preacher curl (24% vs. 15.2%), and total strength (16.4% vs. 11.7%). A time vs. group interaction ( p < 0.05) was observed, with high protein intake presenting greater increases compared with moderate protein intake, for skeletal muscle mass (5.3% vs. 3.2%). In all groups, a main effect of time ( p < 0.05) was observed for knee extension and chest press. We conclude that intake of >1.0 g/kg/day of protein promotes gains in skeletal muscle mass and muscular strength after RT in untrained older women.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine the effect of carbohydrate-protein supplementation with whey protein (CHO-PROw) after resistance training, and casein protein (PROc) before bedtime on the concentration of growth hormone (GH), insulin (I) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1), as well as serum creatine kinase (CK) activity. Twelve strength trained male subjects (age: 25.8 ± 4.7 years; training experience 6.1 ± 0.79 years; body mass 75.9 ± 2.7 kg; body height 171.8 ± 13.3 cm) were recruited for the study. They were randomly divided into an experimental group (group E, n = 6) and a control group (group C, n = 6). All study participants completed full barbell squats with a constant external load of 90% one-repetition maximum (1RM) and a volume of 12 sets. In each set three repetitions were performed with 3 min rest periods after each set. Immediately after the exercise protocol, the subjects from the experimental group received a carbohydrate-protein complex (CHO-PROw) with a dose of 0.5 g/kg of body mass, while before bedtime they ingested a protein supplement (PROc) consisting of 90% casein protein with a dose of 0.3 g/kg of body weight The results indicate that a ignificant increase in GH concentration occurred in the experimental group between the pre-exercise level and after 24 h of recovery (p<0.01), as well as between 1 h and 24 hours of recovery (p<0.01). Significantly higher levels of GH were also found between the control group and the experimental group 24 hours after exercise (p<0.01). The results showed significantly higher levels of IGF-1 in the experimental than in the control group after 24 hours of recovery (p<0.05). In the case of insulin, no significant differences were observed when comparing levels before exercise, after exercise, after 1 hour of recovery and after 24 hours of recovery. The CHO-PROw and the PROc supplements did not reduce post-exercise muscle membrane damage as evidenced by serum CK activity. The intake of these supplements after high-intensity resistance exercise caused an increase in GH and IGF-1 concentration, which could stimulate muscle hypertrophy and inhibit proteolysis.",

    "abstract": "A linear dose-response relationship between resistance-training (RT) volume and hypertrophy/strength has been proposed when ≤10 to 12 weekly sets are implemented. The present study aimed to understand the impact of low to high weekly RT volume on muscular adaptations in trained young men over 6 wk of RT. RT-experienced men (N = 49) were randomly allocated to a low (LOW; n = 17), moderate (MOD; n = 15), or high (HIGH, n = 17) -volume group, performing 9, 18, or 27 weekly sets of biceps RT, respectively, for 6 wk. RT was performed once (LOW) or twice (MOD and HIGH) weekly. Postexercise protein intake was controlled with both dietary intake and external training volume recorded. Before and after RT, assessments of biceps muscle thickness (MT) via ultrasound, isometric, and 1-repetition-maximum (1RM) strength were performed. Data were analyzed using 1-way analysis of variance (baseline characteristics) and repeated-measures analysis of variance (within- and between-groups pre-to-post change). MT significantly increased in all groups (4.3% [7.9%], 9.5% [11.8%], and 5.4% [6.3%] for LOW, MOD, and HIGH, respectively; P < .05), as did 1RM strength (P ≤ .001 for all). Isometric strength increased significantly in HIGH only (8.5% [15.1%], P < .05). There were no significant differences between groups in MT or indices of strength. However, effect-size estimates revealed that the magnitude of response was \"moderate to large\" for MOD and HIGH when compared with LOW. The findings demonstrate that 9 weekly sets of biceps-focused RT, performed in 1 weekly session, are sufficient to increase MT, whereas 18-27 sets performed over 2 weekly sessions may confer greater strength increases.",

    "title": "Are Canadian protein and physical activity guidelines optimal for sarcopenia prevention in older adults?",
    "abstract": "Aging is characterized by physiological and morphological changes that affect body composition, strength, and function, ultimately leading to sarcopenia. This condition results in physical disability, falls, fractures, poor quality of life, and increased health care costs. Evidence suggests that increased consumption of dietary protein and physical activity levels, especially resistance exercise, can counteract the trajectory of sarcopenia. Canadian guidelines for protein intake and physical activity were last updated in 2005 and 2011, respectively, and new evidence on sarcopenia diagnosis, prevention, and treatment is rapidly evolving. Protein recommendations are set as \"one-size-fits-all\" for both young and older adults. Recent evidence demonstrates that current recommendations are insufficient to meet the minimum protein requirement to counteract muscle loss and to stimulate hypertrophy in healthy older adults. Beyond quantity, protein quality is also essential to benefit muscle anabolism in older adults. In terms of physical activity, resistance exercise training is a potential strategy to counteract age-related effects, as it can elicit muscle hypertrophic response in addition to increases in muscle strength and function in older adults. Canadian physical activity guidelines lack details on how this modality of training should be performed. Current guidelines for protein intake and physical activity do not reflect recent knowledge on sarcopenia prevention. The gap between guidelines and the latest evidence on the maintenance and promotion of older adult's health highlight the need for updated protein and physical activity recommendations.",

    "abstract": "We investigated the effects of regular leucine intake and/or resistance exercise training on skeletal muscle hypertrophy and satellite cell activity after the administration of different doses of leucine. Ten-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to six groups (n = 7 per group): a control group (Con), two groups receiving either 10% (0.135 g/kg.wt) (Leu10) or 50% (0.675 g/kg.wt) (Leu50) leucine supplementation, and three exercise groups receiving 0% (Ex), 10% (Leu10Ex), and 50% (Leu50Ex) leucine supplementation. The rats performed ladder climbing exercises thrice per week for 8 weeks, and received leucine supplements at the same time daily. Muscle phenotypes were assessed by immunohistochemistry. MyoD, myogenin, and IGF1 protein levels were determined by western blot. The Leu50Ex group displayed significantly higher numbers of positive embryonic myosin fibers (0.35 ± 0.08, 250%) and myonuclei (3.29 ± 0.3, 118.7%) than all other groups. And exercise training groups increased the cross-sectional area, the number of satellite cells and protein expression of MyoD, myogenin, and IGF1alpha relative to the Control group (P < 0.05). However, Only leucine supplementation group did not increase skeletal muscle hypertrophy and satellite cell activity, regardless of the dose (P > 0.05). Leucine intake accompanied by regular exercise training may increase satellite cell activation in skeletal muscles, and improve muscle quality more effectively than continuous leucine ingestion alone.",

    "abstract": "Human skeletal muscle satellite cells are activated in response to both resistance and endurance exercise. It was initially proposed that satellite cell proliferation and differentiation were only required to support resistance exercise-induced hypertrophy. However, satellite cells may also play a role in muscle fibre remodelling after endurance-based exercise and extracellular matrix regulation. Given the importance of dietary protein, particularly branched chain amino acids, in supporting myofibrillar and mitochondrial adaptations to both resistance and endurance-based training, a greater understanding of how protein intake impacts satellite cell activity would provide further insight into the mechanisms governing skeletal muscle remodelling with exercise. While many studies have investigated the capacity for protein ingestion to increase post-exercise rates of muscle protein synthesis, few investigations have examined the role for protein ingestion to modulate satellite cell activity. Here we review the molecular mechanisms controlling the activation of satellite cells in response to mechanical stress and protein intake in both in vitro and in vivo models. We provide a mechanistic framework that describes how protein ingestion may enhance satellite activity and promote exercise adaptations in human skeletal muscle.",

    "title": "Recent Perspectives Regarding the Role of Dietary Protein for the Promotion of Muscle Hypertrophy with Resistance Exercise Training.",
    "abstract": "Skeletal muscle supports locomotion and serves as the largest site of postprandial glucose disposal; thus it is a critical organ for physical and metabolic health. Skeletal muscle mass is regulated by the processes of muscle protein synthesis (MPS) and muscle protein breakdown (MPB), both of which are sensitive to external loading and aminoacidemia. Hyperaminoacidemia results in a robust but transient increase in rates of MPS and a mild suppression of MPB. Resistance exercise potentiates the aminoacidemia-induced rise in MPS that, when repeated over time, results in gradual radial growth of skeletal muscle (i.e., hypertrophy). Factors that affect MPS include both quantity and composition of the amino acid source. Specifically, MPS is stimulated in a dose-responsive manner and the primary amino acid agonist of this process is leucine. MPB also appears to be regulated in part by protein intake, which can exert a suppressive effect on MPB. At high protein doses the suppression of MPB may interfere with skeletal muscle adaptation following resistance exercise. In this review, we examine recent advancements in our understanding of how protein ingestion impacts skeletal muscle growth following resistance exercise in young adults during energy balance and energy restriction. We also provide practical recommendations for exercisers who wish to maximize the hypertrophic response of skeletal muscle during resistance exercise training.",

    "abstract": "Dietary protein intake is critical for maintaining an optimal muscle mass, especially among older individuals. Although protein supplementation during resistance training (RT) has been shown to further augment training-induced muscle mass in older individuals, the impact of daily variations in protein intake on training-induced muscle mass has not been explored thus far. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the relationship between the dietary protein and amino acid intake and RT-induced muscle hypertrophy among older individuals. Ten healthy older men (n=10; mean age=69±2 y; body weight (BW)=61.5±2.2 kg; height=1.65±0.02 m) participated in progressive RT performed 3 times/wk for 12 wk. Body composition (using DXA) and nutritional assessments (using a 3-d dietary record) were performed before and after the training period. Leg lean mass (LLM) increased significantly (15.0±0.8 vs. 15.4±0.8 kg, p<0.05) after RT, with no change in dietary nutrient intake. The average dietary protein intake was 1.62±0.11 g/kg BW/d, while essential amino acids was 600±51 mg/kg BW/d. Although the correlation between the increase in LLM and dietary protein intake was not significant, a significant correlation was found between the increase in LLM and dietary essential amino acid (EAA) intake. Furthermore, there were significant correlations between the increase in LLM and protein as well as EAA (especially leucine) intake at breakfast among subjects with suboptimal protein intake (p<0.05). Our study findings indicate that dietary protein as well as EAA intake may be significant contributing factors in muscle hypertrophic response during RT among healthy older men.",

    "title": "Effect of Losartan on the Acute Response of Human Elderly Skeletal Muscle to Exercise.",
    "abstract": "To investigate the effect of blocking the angiotensin II Type I receptor (AT1R) upon the response to acute heavy-resistance exercise in elderly human skeletal muscle. The hypothesis was that AT1R blocking would result in a superior myogenic response accompanied by down-regulation of transforming growth factor-beta and up-regulation of insulin-like growth factor-1 signaling. Twenty-eight healthy elderly men (+64 yr) were randomized into two groups, consuming either AT1R blocker (losartan, 100 mg·d) or placebo for 18 d before exercise. Participants performed one bout of heavy-unilateral-resistance exercise. Six muscle biopsies were obtained from the vastus lateralis muscles of each subject: two before exercise and four after exercise (4.5 h and 1, 4, and 7 d). Blood pressure and blood samples were collected at the same time points. Biopsies were sectioned for immunohistochemistry to determine the number of satellite cells associated with Type I and Type II fibers. Gene expression levels of Notch, connective tissue, and myogenic signaling pathways were determined by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Changes over time were detected for circulating creatine kinase, the number of satellite cells per Type I fiber, and most of the gene targets, with no specific effect of losartan on these. However, when compared with placebo, losartan intake resulted in a greater suppression of myostatin messenger RNA. In general, there does not seem to be any effect of AT1R blocking on satellite cell number or myogenic pathways in elderly men in the days after one bout of heavy-resistance exercise. However, the greater suppression of myostatin may prove to be beneficial over a long-term intervention designed to induce hypertrophy.",

    "abstract": "HIIT (high-intensity interval training) has the potential to reduce cardiometabolic risk factors, but the effects on cardiac remodeling and local RAS (renin-angiotensin system) in mice fed high-fat or high-fructose diets still need to be fully addressed. Sixty male C57BL/6 mice (12weeks old) were randomly divided into three groups, control (C), High-fat (HF), or High-fructose diet (HRU) and were monitored for eight weeks before being submitted to the HIIT. Each group was randomly assigned to 2 subgroups, one subgroup was started on a 12-week HIIT protocol (T=trained group), while the other subgroup remained non-exercised (NT=not-trained group). HIIT reduced BM and systolic blood pressure in high-fat groups, while enhanced insulin sensitivity after high-fat or high-fructose intake. Moreover, HIIT reduced left ventricular hypertrophy in HF-T and HFRU-T. Notably, HIIT modulated key factors in the local left ventricular renin-angiotensin-system (RAS): reduced protein expression of renin, ACE (Angiotensin-converting enzyme), and (Angiotensin type 2 receptor) AT2R in HF-T and HFRU-T groups but reduced (Angiotensin type 1 receptor) AT1R protein expression only in the high-fat trained group. HIIT modulated ACE2/Ang (1-7)/Mas receptor axis. ACE2 mRNA gene expression was enhanced in HF-T and HFRU-T groups, complying with elevated Mas (Mas proto-oncogene, G protein-coupled receptor) receptor mRNA gene expression after HIIT. This study shows the effectiveness of HIIT sessions in producing improvements in insulin sensitivity and mitigating LV hypertrophy, though hypertension was controlled only in the high-fat-fed submitted to HIIT protocol. Local RAS system in the heart mediates these findings and receptor MAS seems to play a pivotal role when it comes to the amelioration of cardiac structural and functional remodeling due to HIIT.",

    "abstract": "This study tested the hypothesis that high doses of anti-inflammatory drugs would attenuate the adaptive response to resistance training compared with low doses. Healthy men and women (aged 18-35 years) were randomly assigned to daily consumption of ibuprofen (IBU; 1200 mg; n = 15) or acetylsalicylic acid (ASA; 75 mg; n = 16) for 8 weeks. During this period, subjects completed supervised knee-extensor resistance training where one leg was subjected to training with maximal volitional effort in each repetition using a flywheel ergometer (FW), while the other leg performed conventional (work-matched across groups) weight-stack training (WS). Before and after training, muscle volume (MRI) and strength were assessed, and muscle biopsies were analysed for gene and protein expression of muscle growth regulators. The increase in m. quadriceps volume was similar between FW and WS, yet was (averaged across legs) greater in ASA (7.5%) compared with IBU (3.7%, group difference 34 cm Maximal over-the-counter doses of ibuprofen attenuate strength and muscle hypertrophic adaptations to 8 weeks of resistance training in young adults.

Random-effects meta-analyses and meta-regressions with four a priori determined covariates. Two-phase break point analysis was used to determine the relationship between total protein intake and changes in fat-free mass (FFM).

    "abstract": "Fructose-rich caloric sweeteners induce adverse changes in the metabolism of humans. The study evaluated the effects of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) on a fructose feeding model, focusing on the liver, white adipose tissue (WAT), skeletal muscle, and their interplay. Male C57BL/6 mice were fed for 18 wk one of the following diets: control (C; 5% of total energy from fructose) or fructose (F; 55% of total energy from fructose). In the 10th week, for an additional 8-wk period, the groups were divided into nontrained (NT) or HIIT groups, totaling four groups: C-NT, C-HIIT, F-NT, and F-HIIT. At the end of the experiment, fructose consumption in the F-NT group led to a high systolic blood pressure, high plasma triglycerides, insulin resistance with glucose intolerance, and lower insulin sensitivity. We also observed liver steatosis, adipocyte hypertrophy, and diminished gene expressions of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator 1-α and fibronectin type III domain containing 5 (FNDC5; irisin) in this F-NT group. These results were accompanied by decreased gene expressions of nuclear respiratory factor 1 and mitochondrial transcription factor A (markers of mitochondrial biogenesis), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (markers of β-oxidation). HIIT improved all of these data in the C-HIIT and F-HIIT groups. In conclusion, in mice fed a fructose diet, HIIT improved body mass, blood pressure, glucose metabolism, and plasma triglycerides. Liver, WAT, and skeletal muscle were positively modulated by HIIT, indicating HIIT as a coadjutant treatment for diseases affecting these tissues.",

    "abstract": "Intense physical training increases oxidative stress and inflammation, resulting into muscle and cellular damage. The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of caffeine supplementation on trained young individuals subjected to two treadmill maximal tests. It was a double-blind and crossover study comprising 24 active individuals within the age group 18-30 years. The comparisons were conducted: the effect of exercise (week 1 x 2) and caffeine intake (GC x GP) on thiobarbituric acid (TBARS), interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 10 (IL-10) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) variables during pre-exercise time (30 min. after caffeine or placebo intake) and post-exercise (5 min after treadmill test). The comparison between weeks 1 and 2 showed increase in the first week, in the following items: TBARS, IL-6 and IL-10 in the GC and GP groups. The comparison within the same week showed that GC individuals presented lower post-exercise TBARS values in the first and second weeks; IL- 6 presented higher post-exercise values in the GC group in both weeks. The paired analysis comparing pre- and post-exercise, with and without caffeine showed that IL-6 presented higher post-exercise values in the GC group. Caffeine used by athletes can decrease oxidative stress. The increased IL-6 suggest that this ergogenic supplement may stimulate muscle hypertrophy, since IL-6 has myokine effect. However, the caffeine effect on IL-6 level and muscle hypertrophy increase should be better investigated in future studies.",

In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study, 20 healthy young (22 ± 2 years) participants were assigned to two groups: a placebo-supplement group (PLA, N = 10) or a leucine-supplement group (LEU, N = 10).

    "abstract": "It has been proposed that protein supplementation during resistance exercise training enhances muscle hypertrophy. The degree of hypertrophy during training is controlled in part through the activation of satellite cells and myonuclear accretion. This study aimed to determine the efficacy of protein supplementation (and the type of protein) during traditional resistance training on myofiber cross-sectional area, satellite cell content, and myonuclear addition. Healthy young men participated in supervised whole-body progressive resistance training 3 d·wk for 12 wk. Participants were randomized to one of three groups ingesting a daily 22-g macronutrient dose of soy-dairy protein blend (PB, n = 22), whey protein isolate (WP, n = 15), or an isocaloric maltodextrin placebo (MDP, n = 17). Lean mass, vastus lateralis myofiber-type-specific cross-sectional area, satellite cell content, and myonuclear addition were assessed before and after resistance training. PB and the pooled protein treatments (PB + WP = PRO) exhibited a greater whole-body lean mass %change compared with MDP (P = 0.057 for PB) and (P = 0.050 for PRO), respectively. All treatments demonstrated similar leg muscle hypertrophy and vastus lateralis myofiber-type-specific cross-sectional area (P < 0.05). Increases in myosin heavy chain I and II myofiber satellite cell content and myonuclei content were also detected after exercise training (P < 0.05). Protein supplementation during resistance training has a modest effect on whole-body lean mass as compared with exercise training without protein supplementation, and there was no effect on any outcome between protein supplement types (blend vs whey). However, protein supplementation did not enhance resistance exercise-induced increases in myofiber hypertrophy, satellite cell content, or myonuclear addition in young healthy men. We propose that as long as protein intake is adequate during muscle overload, the adaptations in muscle growth and function will not be influenced by protein supplementation.",

    "abstract": "Hwang, PS, Andre, TL, McKinley-Barnard, SK, Morales Marroquín, FE, Gann, JJ, Song, JJ, and Willoughby, DS. Resistance training-induced elevations in muscular strength in trained men are maintained after 2 weeks of detraining and not differentially affected by whey protein supplementation. J Strength Cond Res 31(4): 869-881, 2017-Resistance training (RT) with nutritional strategies incorporating whey protein intake postexercise can stimulate muscle protein synthesis and elicit hypertrophy. The early phases of training-induced anabolic responses can be attenuated with longer-term training. It is currently unknown if short-term detraining (DT) can restore these blunted anabolic responses during a subsequent retraining (ReT) period. Twenty resistance-trained men (age 20.95 ± 1.23 years; n = 20) were randomized into one of 2 groups (PRO or CHO; 25 g) in a double-blind manner. Participants followed a 4-day per week RT program (4-week RT; 2-week DT; 4-week ReT) while consuming their respective supplement only on workout days during RT and ReT, but every day during DT. At baseline, 4 weeks after RT (post-RT), 2 weeks after DT (post-2-week DT), and after 4 weeks of ReT after DT (post-ReT), leg press strength (LPS) was assessed and rectus femoris cross-sectional area and lean mass changes were assessed by ultrasonography and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, respectively. A factorial 2 × 4 (group by time) analyses of variance with repeated measures were used with a probability level at ≤0.05. LPS was elevated throughout the 10-week training study (p = 0.003) with no decrease in LPS after DT in both groups. Although not statistically significant, both groups retained lean mass after DT. A 2-week period of DT appeared to retain muscular strength in resistance-trained men. Therefore, a short-term period of DT can potentially retain lower-body strength in young resistance-trained men irrespective of supplementing with 25 g of whey protein postexercise.",

    "title": "The effect of resistance training on quadriceps muscle volume and some growth factors in elderly and young men.",
    "abstract": "Aging process is associated with loss of muscle mass, strength and growth factors dysfunction. Resistance training is one of the effective methods to overcome a decline in muscle mass, strength and also can modulate the level of myostatin, follistatin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) factors. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of 8 week resistance training on different anabolic factors which influence muscle hypertrophy in elderly and young men. Fifteen elderly and sixteen young men volunteered and participated in a periodized 3-day per week progressive resistance training program for a total of 8 weeks. Daily calorie intake, muscle volume, cross-sectional area (by computed tomography) and myostatin, follistatin, IGF-1, growth hormone (GH) and testosterone were calculated before and after the training protocol. At the end of the training period, the strength in the elderly group increased significantly compared to the young group (p<0,05); no differences of daily nutrient intake were found in both groups (p>0,05). Quadriceps muscle volume and cross-sectional area increased more in the younger group (p<0,05). Myostatin concentration significantly decreased in both groups (p<0,05), yet the amount of change was not different in either groups (p>0,05). Follistatin and testosterone increased in both groups (p<0,05), but growth hormone and IGF-1 increased in the younger group only (p<0,05). Resistance training improved hypertrophy and lead to anabolic conditions in elder and young subjects, but in different ways. In this regard, GH-IGF-1 axis and growth factors profile at the baseline had an important role in different age-related hypertrophy. Процесс старения связан с потерей мышечной массы, силы и дисфункцией факторов роста. Силовая тренировка является одним из эффективных методов преодоления снижения мышечной массы, силы, а также может модулировать уровень миостатина, фоллистатина и инсулиноподобных факторов роста-1 (IGF-1). Целью данного исследования было изучение влияния 8-недельной силовой тренировки на различные анаболические факторы, которые влияют на мышечную гипертрофию у пожилых и молодых людей. 15 пожилых мужчин и 16 юношей добровольно участвовали в программе тренировок с периодичностью 3 раза в нед в течение 8 нед. Рассчитывали ежедневное потребление калорий, мышечный объем, площадь поперечного сечения (по КТ), а также измеряли до и после тренировок уровень миостатина, фоллистатина, IGF-1, гормона роста (GH) и тестостерона. В конце тренировочного периода сила в группе пожилого возраста значительно повысилась по сравнению с молодой группой (p<0,05) при отсутствии различий суточного потребления питательных веществ в обеих группах (p>0,05). Объем четырехглавой мышцы и площадь поперечного сечения больше увеличились в младшей группе (р<0,05). Концентрация миостатина значительно снизилась в обеих группах (p<0,05), однако величина изменения не отличалась в группах (p>0,05). Фоллистатин и тестостерон повысился в обеих группах (р<0,05), но GH и IGF-1 увеличился только в младшей группе (р<0,05). Силовые тренировки улучшили гипертрофию и привели к анаболическим условиям как в пожилой, так и в молодой группе, но разными путями. В связи с этим, оси GH–IGF-1 и профилям факторов роста на базовом уровне отводится важная роль в разных возрастных гипертрофиях.",

    "title": "Carbohydrate intake and resistance-based exercise: are current recommendations reflective of actual need?",
    "abstract": "Substantial research has been completed examining the impact of carbohydrate (CHO) intake on endurance exercise, whereas its role in resistance-based exercise performance, adaptation and cell signalling has yet to be fully characterised. This empirical shortcoming has precluded the ability to establish specific CHO recommendations for resistance exercise. This results in recommendations largely stemming from findings based on endurance exercise and/or anecdotal evidence despite the distinct energetic demands and molecular responses mediating adaptation from endurance- and resistance-based exercise. Moreover, the topic of CHO and exercise has become one of polarising nature with divergent views - some substantiated, others lacking evidence. Current literature suggests a moderately high daily CHO intake (3-7 g/kg per d) for resistance training, which is thought to prevent glycogen depletion and facilitate performance and adaptation. However, contemporary investigation, along with an emerging understanding of the molecular underpinnings of resistance exercise adaptation, may suggest that such an intake may not be necessary. In addition to the low likelihood of true glycogen depletion occurring in response to resistance exercise, a diet restrictive in CHO may not be detrimental to acute resistance exercise performance or the cellular signalling activity responsible for adaptation, even when muscle glycogen stores are reduced. Current evidence suggests that signalling of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1, the key regulatory kinase for gene translation (protein synthesis), is unaffected by CHO restriction or low muscular glycogen concentrations. Such findings may call into question the current view and subsequent recommendations of CHO intake with regard to resistance-based exercise.",

    "abstract": "Protein consumption after resistance exercise potentiates muscle protein synthesis, but its effects on subsequent appetite in this context are unknown. This study examined appetite and energy intake following consumption of protein- and carbohydrate-containing drinks after resistance exercise. After familiarisation, 15 resistance training males (age 21 ± 1 years, body mass 78.0 ± 11.9 kg, stature 1.78 ± 0.07 m) completed two randomised, double-blind trials, consisting of lower-body resistance exercise, followed by consumption of a whey protein (PRO 23.9 ± 3.6 g protein) or dextrose (CHO 26.5 ± 3.8 g carbohydrate) drink in the 5 min post-exercise. An ad libitum meal was served 60 min later, with subjective appetite measured throughout. Drinks were flavoured and matched for energy content and volume. The PRO drink provided 0.3 g/kg body mass protein. Ad libitum energy intake (PRO 3742 ± 994 kJ; CHO 4172 ± 1132 kJ; P = 0.007) and mean eating rate (PRO 339 ± 102 kJ/min; CHO 405 ± 154 kJ/min; P = 0.009) were lower during PRO. The change in eating rate was associated with the change in energy intake (R = 0.661, P = 0.007). No interaction effects were observed for subjective measures of appetite. The PRO drink was perceived as creamier and thicker, and less pleasant, sweet and refreshing (P < 0.05). These results suggest whey protein consumption after resistance exercise reduces subsequent energy intake, and this might be partially mediated by a reduced eating rate. Whilst this reduced energy intake is unlikely to impair hypertrophy, it may be of value in supporting an energy deficit for weight loss.",

    "title": "Combined effects of resistance training and calorie restriction on mitochondrial fusion and fission proteins in rat skeletal muscle.",
    "abstract": "Recent studies have demonstrated that resistance exercise leads not only to muscle hypertrophy, but it also improves mitochondrial function. Because calorie restriction (CR) has been suggested as a way to induce mitochondrial biogenesis, we examined the effects of resistance training with or without CR on muscle weight and key mitochondrial parameters in rat skeletal muscle. Four weeks of resistance training (thrice/wk) resulted in increased gastrocnemius muscle weight by 14% in rats fed ad libitum (AL). The degree of muscle-weight increase via resistance training was lower in rats with CR (7.4%). CR showed no effect on phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling proteins rpS6 and ULK1. Our results revealed that CR resulted in elevated levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) protein, a known master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis. Resistance training alone also resulted in increased PGC-1α levels in skeletal muscle. The magnitude of the increase in PGC-1α was similar in rats in both the CR and AL groups. Moreover, we found that resistance training with CR resulted in elevated levels of proteins involved in mitochondrial fusion (Opa1 and Mfn1), and oxidative phosphorylation, whereas there was no effect of CR on the fission-regulatory proteins Fis1 and Drp1. These results indicate that CR attenuates resistance training-induced muscle hypertrophy, and that it may enhance mitochondrial adaptations in skeletal muscle.",

    "abstract": "The transcriptional coactivator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator (PGC)-1α is recognized as the master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis. However, recently a novel isoform, PGC-1α4, that specifically regulates muscle hypertrophy was discovered. Because stimulation of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) activity is tightly coupled to hypertrophy, we hypothesized that activation of this pathway would upregulate PGC-1α4. Eight male subjects performed heavy resistance exercise (10 × 8-12 repetitions at ∼75% of 1 repetition maximum in leg press) on four different occasions, ingesting in random order a solution containing essential amino acids (EAA), branched-chain amino acids (BCAA), leucine, or flavored water (placebo) during and after the exercise. Biopsies were taken from the vastus lateralis muscle before and immediately after exercise, as well as following 90 and 180 min of recovery. Signaling through mTORC1, as reflected in p70S6 kinase phosphorylation, was stimulated to a greater extent by the EAA and BCAA than the leucine or placebo supplements. Unexpectedly, intake of EAA or BCAA attenuated the stimulatory effect of exercise on PGC-1α4 expression by ∼50% (from a 10- to 5-fold increase with BCAA and EAA, P < 0.05) 3 h after exercise, whereas intake of leucine alone did not reduce this response. The 60% increase (P < 0.05) in the level of PGC-1α1 mRNA 90 min after exercise was uninfluenced by amino acid intake. Muscle glycogen levels were reduced and AMP-activated protein kinase α2 activity and phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase enhanced to the same extent with all four supplements. In conclusion, induction of PGC-1α4 does not appear to regulate the nutritional (BCAA or EAA)-mediated activation of mTORC1 in human muscle.",

    "abstract": "Introduction. Sarcopenia is a process characterized by reduction in protein mass and muscle strength with increasing age, especially in the postmenopausal period, resulting in functional limitations and with great impact on the physical autonomy of the elderly. Objective. To evaluate the effects of diets with vegetable proteins (VP) or animal proteins (AP) associated with resistance training (RT) on the structural and biochemical parameters of the medial gastrocnemius muscle in Wistar rats with sarcopenia. Methods. An experimental model with ovariectomized rats was used to induce sarcopenia and resistance training. The histochemical technique was used for the typing of muscle fibers, the cross-sectional area of myocytes, and volume densities of myocytes and interstitium; the technique of Picrosirius stain was used to highlight the collagen fibers. Results. The VP diet was not able to minimize the effects of sarcopenia in the medial gastrocnemius of sedentary animals and when associated with RT, it promoted maintenance of the CSA, attenuating the atrophy of type IIB fibers in the medial gastrocnemius. The AP diet in sedentary animals protected the type I fibers. When combined with RT, the AP promoted muscle remodeling, with reduction in volume density of type I and IIA fibers, and increase of IIB fibers, together with an increase in collagen volume density. Conclusion. The data suggest a tendency to better results of hypertrophy in animal groups that consumed the AP diet, even the sedentary animals, although more evident in those trained.",

    "title": "New strategies in sport nutrition to increase exercise performance.",
    "abstract": "Despite over 50 years of research, the field of sports nutrition continues to grow at a rapid rate. Whilst the traditional research focus was one that centred on strategies to maximise competition performance, emerging data in the last decade has demonstrated how both macronutrient and micronutrient availability can play a prominent role in regulating those cell signalling pathways that modulate skeletal muscle adaptations to endurance and resistance training. Nonetheless, in the context of exercise performance, it is clear that carbohydrate (but not fat) still remains king and that carefully chosen ergogenic aids (e.g. caffeine, creatine, sodium bicarbonate, beta-alanine, nitrates) can all promote performance in the correct exercise setting. In relation to exercise training, however, it is now thought that strategic periods of reduced carbohydrate and elevated dietary protein intake may enhance training adaptations whereas high carbohydrate availability and antioxidant supplementation may actually attenuate training adaptation. Emerging evidence also suggests that vitamin D may play a regulatory role in muscle regeneration and subsequent hypertrophy following damaging forms of exercise. Finally, novel compounds (albeit largely examined in rodent models) such as epicatechins, nicotinamide riboside, resveratrol, β-hydroxy β-methylbutyrate, phosphatidic acid and ursolic acid may also promote or attenuate skeletal muscle adaptations to endurance and strength training. When taken together, it is clear that sports nutrition is very much at the heart of the Olympic motto, Citius, Altius, Fortius (faster, higher, stronger).",

    "abstract": "Nutrition intake in the context of a resistance training (RT) bout may affect body composition and muscle strength. However, the individual and combined effects of whey protein and carbohydrates on long-term resistance training adaptations are poorly understood. A four-week preparatory RT period was conducted in previously untrained males to standardize the training background of the subjects. Thereafter, the subjects were randomized into three groups: 30 g of whey proteins (n = 22), isocaloric carbohydrates (maltodextrin, n = 21), or protein + carbohydrates (n = 25). Within these groups, the subjects were further randomized into two whole-body 12-week RT regimens aiming either for muscle hypertrophy and maximal strength or muscle strength, hypertrophy and power. The post-exercise drink was always ingested immediately after the exercise bout, 2-3 times per week depending on the training period. Body composition (by DXA), quadriceps femoris muscle cross-sectional area (by panoramic ultrasound), maximal strength (by dynamic and isometric leg press) and serum lipids as basic markers of cardiovascular health, were analysed before and after the intervention. Twelve-week RT led to increased fat-free mass, muscle size and strength independent of post-exercise nutrient intake (P < 0.05). However, the whey protein group reduced more total and abdominal area fat when compared to the carbohydrate group independent of the type of RT (P < 0.05). Thus, a larger relative increase (per kg bodyweight) in fat-free mass was observed in the protein vs. carbohydrate group (P < 0.05) without significant differences to the combined group. No systematic effects of the interventions were found for serum lipids. The RT type did not have an effect on the adaptations in response to different supplementation paradigms. Post-exercise supplementation with whey proteins when compared to carbohydrates or combination of proteins and carbohydrates did not have a major effect on muscle size or strength when ingested two to three times a week. However, whey proteins may increase abdominal fat loss and relative fat-free mass adaptations in response to resistance training when compared to fast-acting carbohydrates.",

    "title": "Nutritional Support for Exercise-Induced Injuries.",
    "abstract": "Nutrition is one method to counter the negative impact of an exercise-induced injury. Deficiencies of energy, protein and other nutrients should be avoided. Claims for the effectiveness of many other nutrients following injuries are rampant, but the evidence is equivocal. The results of an exercise-induced injury may vary widely depending on the nature of the injury and severity. Injuries typically result in cessation, or at least a reduction, in participation in sport and decreased physical activity. Limb immobility may be necessary with some injuries, contributing to reduced activity and training. Following an injury, an inflammatory response is initiated and while excess inflammation may be harmful, given the importance of the inflammatory process for wound healing, attempting to drastically reduce inflammation may not be ideal for optimal recovery. Injuries severe enough for immobilization of a limb result in loss of muscle mass and reduced muscle strength and function. Loss of muscle results from reductions in basal muscle protein synthesis and the resistance of muscle to anabolic stimulation. Energy balance is critical. Higher protein intakes (2-2.5 g/kg/day) seem to be warranted during immobilization. At the very least, care should be taken not to reduce the absolute amount of protein intake when energy intake is reduced. There is promising, albeit preliminary, evidence for the use of omega-3 fatty acids and creatine to counter muscle loss and enhance hypertrophy, respectively. The overriding nutritional recommendation for injured exercisers should be to consume a well-balanced diet based on whole, minimally processed foods or ingredients made from whole foods. The diet composition should be carefully assessed and changes considered as the injury heals and activity patterns change.",

    "title": "Nutritional interventions to augment resistance training-induced skeletal muscle hypertrophy.",
    "abstract": "Skeletal muscle mass is regulated by a balance between muscle protein synthesis (MPS) and muscle protein breakdown (MPB). In healthy humans, MPS is more sensitive (varying 4-5 times more than MPB) to changes in protein feeding and loading rendering it the primary locus determining gains in muscle mass. Performing resistance exercise (RE) followed by the consumption of protein results in an augmentation of MPS and, over time, can lead to muscle hypertrophy. The magnitude of the RE-induced increase in MPS is dictated by a variety of factors including: the dose of protein, source of protein, and possibly the distribution and timing of post-exercise protein ingestion. In addition, RE variables such as frequency of sessions, time under tension, volume, and training status play roles in regulating MPS. This review provides a brief overview of our current understanding of how RE and protein ingestion can influence gains in skeletal muscle mass in young, healthy individuals. It is the goal of this review to provide nutritional recommendations for optimal skeletal muscle adaptation. Specifically, we will focus on how the manipulation of protein intake during the recovery period following RE augments the adaptive response.",

    "abstract": "Increasing the frequency of protein consumption is recommended to stimulate muscle hypertrophy with resistance exercise. This study manipulated dietary protein distribution to assess the effect on gains in lean mass during a rugby preseason. Twenty-four developing elite rugby athletes (age 20.1 ± 1.4 years, mass 101.6 ± 12.0 kg; M ± SD) were instructed to consume high biological value (HBV) protein at their main meals and immediately after resistance exercise while limiting protein intake between meals. To manipulate protein intake frequency, the athletes consumed 3 HBV liquid protein supplements (22 g protein) either with main meals (bolus condition) or between meals (frequent condition) for 6 weeks in a 2 × 2 crossover design. Dietary intake and change in lean mass values were compared between conditions by analysis of covariance and correlational analysis. The dietary manipulation successfully altered the protein distribution score (average number of eating occasions containing > 20 g of protein) to 4.0 ± 0.8 and 5.9 ± 0.7 (p < .01) for the bolus and frequent conditions, respectively. There was no difference in gains in lean mass between the bolus (1.4 ± 1.5 kg) and frequent (1.5 ± 1.4 kg) conditions (p = .91). There was no clear effect of increasing protein distribution from approximately 4-6 eating occasions on changes in lean mass during a rugby preseason. However, other dietary factors may have augmented adaptation.",

    "abstract": "This study was designed to determine the appropriate Leucine intake volume to obtain the effects of restoring damaged muscle through the synthesis of muscle proteins to increase skeletal muscle and improve exercise performance, and to achieve enhanced muscle hypertrophy. To clarify the effects of leucine on skeletal muscle hypertrophy of SD rats, following eight weeks of resistance exercise (climbing ladder), the mass of the FHL (Flexor hallucis longus) was measured after extraction, after which change in the activity of muscle signaling proteins (PKB/Akt, mTOR, p70S6K, 4EBP1) was analyzed. The expressions of PKB/Akt, mTOR and p70S6K were increased in L5 (Leucine 50% administration group) compared with the control group (CON) and exercise group (Ex, exercise training group); EL1 (exercise + 10% leucine administration group) and EL5 (exercise + 50% Leucine administration) also exhibited increased expressions of PKB/Akt, mTOR, and p70S6K, while no difference between EL1 and EL5 were observed. No significant differences in 4EBP1 were found among any of the groups. In addition, there were no differences in FHL mass, while relative mass (FHL/body mass) was increased in the exercise group (Ex, EL1, EL5) compared with the control group. No differences were observed among the exercise groups. The present study demonstrated that the relative body mass was increased in the EX group compared with the CON group, while no significant differences in muscle mass could be found among the groups. Even though some signaling proteins were increased, or some differences existed among groups, there were no differences in muscle mass between the leucine administration and exercise training combined with leucine administration groups in the present study.",

    "title": "Protein Ingestion before Sleep Increases Muscle Mass and Strength Gains during Prolonged Resistance-Type Exercise Training in Healthy Young Men.",
    "abstract": "It has been demonstrated that protein ingestion before sleep increases muscle protein synthesis rates during overnight recovery from an exercise bout. However, it remains to be established whether dietary protein ingestion before sleep can effectively augment the muscle adaptive response to resistance-type exercise training. Here we assessed the impact of dietary protein supplementation before sleep on muscle mass and strength gains during resistance-type exercise training. Forty-four young men (22 ± 1 y) were randomly assigned to a progressive, 12-wk resistance exercise training program. One group consumed a protein supplement containing 27.5 g of protein, 15 g of carbohydrate, and 0.1 g of fat every night before sleep. The other group received a noncaloric placebo. Muscle hypertrophy was assessed on a whole-body (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry), limb (computed tomography scan), and muscle fiber (muscle biopsy specimen) level before and after exercise training. Strength was assessed regularly by 1-repetition maximum strength testing. Muscle strength increased after resistance exercise training to a significantly greater extent in the protein-supplemented (PRO) group than in the placebo-supplemented (PLA) group (+164 ± 11 kg and +130 ± 9 kg, respectively; P < 0.001). In addition, quadriceps muscle cross-sectional area increased in both groups over time (P < 0.001), with a greater increase in the PRO group than in the PLA group (+8.4 ± 1.1 cm(2) vs. +4.8 ± 0.8 cm(2), respectively; P < 0.05). Both type I and type II muscle fiber size increased after exercise training (P < 0.001), with a greater increase in type II muscle fiber size in the PRO group (+2319 ± 368 μm(2)) than in the PLA group (+1017 ± 353 μm(2); P < 0.05). Protein ingestion before sleep represents an effective dietary strategy to augment muscle mass and strength gains during resistance exercise training in young men. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02222415.",

    "title": "The effects of protein supplements on muscle mass, strength, and aerobic and anaerobic power in healthy adults: a systematic review.",
    "abstract": "Protein supplements are frequently consumed by athletes and recreationally active adults to achieve greater gains in muscle mass and strength and improve physical performance. This review provides a systematic and comprehensive analysis of the literature that tested the hypothesis that protein supplements accelerate gains in muscle mass and strength resulting in improvements in aerobic and anaerobic power. Evidence statements were created based on an accepted strength of recommendation taxonomy. English language articles were searched through PubMed and Google Scholar using protein and supplements together with performance, exercise, strength, and muscle, alone or in combination as keywords. Additional articles were retrieved from reference lists found in these papers. Studies recruiting healthy adults between 18 and 50 years of age that evaluated the effects of protein supplements alone or in combination with carbohydrate on a performance metric (e.g., one repetition maximum or isometric or isokinetic muscle strength), metrics of body composition, or measures of aerobic or anaerobic power were included in this review. The literature search identified 32 articles which incorporated test metrics that dealt exclusively with changes in muscle mass and strength, 5 articles that implemented combined resistance and aerobic training or followed participants during their normal sport training programs, and 1 article that evaluated changes in muscle oxidative enzymes and maximal aerobic power. All papers were read in detail, and examined for experimental design confounders such as dietary monitoring, history of physical training (i.e., trained and untrained), and the number of participants studied. Studies were also evaluated based on the intensity, frequency, and duration of training, the type and timing of protein supplementation, and the sensitivity of the test metrics. For untrained individuals, consuming supplemental protein likely has no impact on lean mass and muscle strength during the initial weeks of resistance training. However, as the duration, frequency, and volume of resistance training increase, protein supplementation may promote muscle hypertrophy and enhance gains in muscle strength in both untrained and trained individuals. Evidence also suggests that protein supplementation may accelerate gains in both aerobic and anaerobic power. To demonstrate measureable gains in strength and performance with exercise training and protein supplementation, many of the studies reviewed recruited untrained participants. Since skeletal muscle responses to exercise and protein supplementation differ between trained and untrained individuals, findings are not easily generalized for all consumers who may be considering the use of protein supplements. This review suggests that protein supplementation may enhance muscle mass and performance when the training stimulus is adequate (e.g., frequency, volume, duration), and dietary intake is consistent with recommendations for physically active individuals.",

    "title": "Evidence-based recommendations for natural bodybuilding contest preparation: nutrition and supplementation.",
    "abstract": "The popularity of natural bodybuilding is increasing; however, evidence-based recommendations for it are lacking. This paper reviewed the scientific literature relevant to competition preparation on nutrition and supplementation, resulting in the following recommendations. Caloric intake should be set at a level that results in bodyweight losses of approximately 0.5 to 1%/wk to maximize muscle retention. Within this caloric intake, most but not all bodybuilders will respond best to consuming 2.3-3.1 g/kg of lean body mass per day of protein, 15-30% of calories from fat, and the reminder of calories from carbohydrate. Eating three to six meals per day with a meal containing 0.4-0.5 g/kg bodyweight of protein prior and subsequent to resistance training likely maximizes any theoretical benefits of nutrient timing and frequency. However, alterations in nutrient timing and frequency appear to have little effect on fat loss or lean mass retention. Among popular supplements, creatine monohydrate, caffeine and beta-alanine appear to have beneficial effects relevant to contest preparation, however others do not or warrant further study. The practice of dehydration and electrolyte manipulation in the final days and hours prior to competition can be dangerous, and may not improve appearance. Increasing carbohydrate intake at the end of preparation has a theoretical rationale to improve appearance, however it is understudied. Thus, if carbohydrate loading is pursued it should be practiced prior to competition and its benefit assessed individually. Finally, competitors should be aware of the increased risk of developing eating and body image disorders in aesthetic sport and therefore should have access to the appropriate mental health professionals.",

    "title": "A brief review of critical processes in exercise-induced muscular hypertrophy.",
    "abstract": "With regular practice, resistance exercise can lead to gains in skeletal muscle mass by means of hypertrophy. The process of skeletal muscle fiber hypertrophy comes about as a result of the confluence of positive muscle protein balance and satellite cell addition to muscle fibers. Positive muscle protein balance is achieved when the rate of new muscle protein synthesis (MPS) exceeds that of muscle protein breakdown (MPB). While resistance exercise and postprandial hyperaminoacidemia both stimulate MPS, it is through the synergistic effects of these two stimuli that a net gain in muscle proteins occurs and muscle fiber hypertrophy takes place. Current evidence favors the post-exercise period as a time when rapid hyperaminoacidemia promotes a marked rise in the rate of MPS. Dietary proteins with a full complement of essential amino acids and high leucine contents that are rapidly digested are more likely to be efficacious in this regard. Various other compounds have been added to complete proteins, including carbohydrate, arginine and glutamine, in an attempt to augment the effectiveness of the protein in stimulating MPS (or suppressing MPB), but none has proved particularly effective. Evidence points to a higher protein intake in combination with resistance exercise as being efficacious in allowing preservation, and on occasion increases, in skeletal muscle mass with dietary energy restriction aimed at the promotion of weight loss. The goal of this review is to examine practices of protein ingestion in combination with resistance exercise that have some evidence for efficacy and to highlight future areas for investigation.",

    "title": "Synergistic effects of resistance training and protein intake: practical aspects.",
    "abstract": "Resistance training is a potent stimulus to increase skeletal muscle mass. The muscle protein accretion process depends on a robust synergistic action between protein intake and overload. The intake of protein after resistance training increases plasma amino acids, which results in the activation of signaling molecules leading to increased muscle protein synthesis (MPS) and muscle hypertrophy. Although both essential and non-essential amino acids are necessary for hypertrophy, the intake of free L-leucine or high-leucine whole proteins has been specifically shown to increase the initiation of translation that is essential for elevated MPS. The literature supports the use of protein intake following resistance-training sessions to enhance MPS; however, less understood are the effects of different protein sources and timing protocols on MPS. The sum of the adaptions from each individual training session is essential to muscle hypertrophy, and thus highlights the importance of an optimal supplementation protocol. The aim of this review is to present recent findings reported in the literature and to discuss the practical application of these results. In that light, new speculations and questions will arise that may direct future investigations. The information and recommendations generated in this review should be of benefit to clinical dietitians as well as those engaged in sports.",

    "title": "The effect of protein timing on muscle strength and hypertrophy: a meta-analysis.",
    "abstract": "Protein timing is a popular dietary strategy designed to optimize the adaptive response to exercise. The strategy involves consuming protein in and around a training session in an effort to facilitate muscular repair and remodeling, and thereby enhance post-exercise strength- and hypertrophy-related adaptations. Despite the apparent biological plausibility of the strategy, however, the effectiveness of protein timing in chronic training studies has been decidedly mixed. The purpose of this paper therefore was to conduct a multi-level meta-regression of randomized controlled trials to determine whether protein timing is a viable strategy for enhancing post-exercise muscular adaptations. The strength analysis comprised 478 subjects and 96 ESs, nested within 41 treatment or control groups and 20 studies. The hypertrophy analysis comprised 525 subjects and 132 ESs, nested with 47 treatment or control groups and 23 studies. A simple pooled analysis of protein timing without controlling for covariates showed a small to moderate effect on muscle hypertrophy with no significant effect found on muscle strength. In the full meta-regression model controlling for all covariates, however, no significant differences were found between treatment and control for strength or hypertrophy. The reduced model was not significantly different from the full model for either strength or hypertrophy. With respect to hypertrophy, total protein intake was the strongest predictor of ES magnitude. These results refute the commonly held belief that the timing of protein intake in and around a training session is critical to muscular adaptations and indicate that consuming adequate protein in combination with resistance exercise is the key factor for maximizing muscle protein accretion.",

Dynamic changes in the post-exercise plasma metabolite profile consisted of fluctuations in alanine, beta-hydroxybutyrate, branched amino acids, creatine, glucose, glutamine, glutamate, histidine, lipids and tyrosine. In comparison with the intake of a non-caloric drink, the same pattern of changes in low-molecular weight plasma metabolites was found for both whey and caseinate intake. However, the study indicated that whey and caseinate protein intake had a different impact on low-density and very-low-density lipoproteins present in the blood, which may be ascribed to different effects of the two protein sources on the mobilization of lipid resources during energy deficiency. In conclusion, no difference in the effects on low-molecular weight metabolites as measured by proton NMR-based metabonomics was found between the two protein sources.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of high-load strength training and protein intake in patients undergoing dialysis with a focus on muscle strength, physical performance, and muscle morphology. This was a randomized controlled study conducted in three dialysis centers. Subjects for the study included 29 patients undergoing dialysis. The participants went through a control period of 16 weeks before completing 16 weeks of strength training. Before the training period, the participants were randomly assigned to receive a protein or a nonprotein drink after every training session. Muscle strength and power were tested using the good strength equipment and the leg extensor power rig. Physical performance and function were assessed using a chair stand test and the Short Form 36 questionnaire. Muscle fiber type size and composition were analyzed in biopsies obtained from the m. vastus lateralis. All variables remained unchanged during the control period. After training, muscle strength and power, physical performance, and physical function increased significantly. Muscle fiber composition was changed by a relative decrease in type 2x muscle fiber number whereas muscle size at the fiber level was unchanged. There were no effects of combining the training with protein intake. High-load strength training is associated with improvements in muscle strength and power, physical performance, and quality of life. The effects were surprisingly not associated with muscle hypertrophy, and the results did not reveal any additional benefit of combining the training with protein intake. The positive results in muscle strength and physical performance have clinically relevant implications in the treatment of patients undergoing dialysis.",

    "title": "Unique aspects of competitive weightlifting: performance, training and physiology.",
    "abstract": "Weightlifting is a dynamic strength and power sport in which two, multijoint, whole-body lifts are performed in competition; the snatch and clean and jerk. During the performance of these lifts, weightlifters have achieved some of the highest absolute and relative peak power outputs reported in the literature. The training structure of competitive weightlifters is characterized by the frequent use of high-intensity resistance exercise movements. Varied coaching and training philosophies currently exist around the world and further research is required to substantiate the best type of training programme for male and female weightlifters of various age groups. As competitive weightlifting is contested over eight male and seven female body weight categories, the anthropometric characteristics of the athletes widely ranges. The body compositions of weightlifters are similar to that of athletes of comparable body mass in other strength and power sports. However, the shorter height and limb lengths of weightlifters provide mechanical advantages when lifting heavy loads by reducing the mechanical torque and the vertical distance that the barbell must be displaced. Furthermore, the shorter body dimensions coincide with a greater mean skeletal muscle cross-sectional area that is advantageous to weightlifting performance. Weightlifting training induces a high metabolic cost. Although dietary records demonstrate that weightlifters typically meet their required daily energy intake, weightlifters have been shown to over consume protein and fat at the expense of adequate carbohydrate. The resulting macronutrient imbalance may not yield optimal performance gains. Cross-sectional data suggest that weightlifting training induces type IIX to IIA fibre-type transformation. Furthermore, weightlifters exhibit hypertrophy of type II fibres that is advantageous to weightlifting performance and maximal force production. As such, the isometric peak force and contractile rate of force development of weightlifters is ~15-20% and ~13-16% greater, respectively, than in other strength and power athletes. In addition, weightlifting training has been shown to reduce the typical sex-related difference in the expression of neuromuscular strength and power. However, this apparent sex-related difference appears to be augmented with increasing adult age demonstrating that women undergo a greater age-related decline in muscle shortening velocity and peak power when compared with men. Weightlifting training and competition has been shown to induce significant structural and functional adaptations of the cardiovascular system. The collective evidence shows that these adaptations are physiological as opposed to pathological. Finally, the acute exercise-induced testosterone, cortisol and growth hormone responses of weightlifters have similarities to that of following conventional strength and hypertrophy protocols involving large muscle mass exercises. The routine assessment of the basal testosterone : cortisol ratio may be beneficial when attempting to quantify the adaptive responses to weightlifting training. As competitive weightlifting is becoming increasingly popular around the world, further research addressing the physiological responses and adaptations of female weightlifters and younger (i.e. ≤17 years of age) and older (i.e. ≥35 years of age) weightlifters of both sexes is required.",

    "abstract": "Skeletal muscle is the major deposit of protein molecules. As for any cell or tissue, total muscle protein reflects a dynamic turnover between net protein synthesis and degradation. Noninvasive and invasive techniques have been applied to determine amino acid catabolism and muscle protein building at rest, during exercise and during the recovery period after a single experiment or training sessions. Stable isotopic tracers ((13)C-lysine, (15)N-glycine, ²H5-phenylalanine) and arteriovenous differences have been used in studies of skeletal muscle and collagen tissues under resting and exercise conditions. There are different fractional synthesis rates in skeletal muscle and tendon tissues, but there is no major difference between collagen and myofibrillar protein synthesis. Strenuous exercise provokes increased proteolysis and decreased protein synthesis, the opposite occurring during the recovery period. Individuals who exercise respond differently when resistance and endurance types of contractions are compared. Endurance exercise induces a greater oxidative capacity (enzymes) compared to resistance exercise, which induces fiber hypertrophy (myofibrils). Nitrogen balance (difference between protein intake and protein degradation) for athletes is usually balanced when the intake of protein reaches 1.2 g · kg(-1) · day(-1) compared to 0.8 g · kg(-1) · day(-1) in resting individuals. Muscular activities promote a cascade of signals leading to the stimulation of eukaryotic initiation of myofibrillar protein synthesis. As suggested in several publications, a bolus of 15-20 g protein (from skimmed milk or whey proteins) and carbohydrate (± 30 g maltodextrine) drinks is needed immediately after stopping exercise to stimulate muscle protein and tendon collagen turnover within 1 h.",

    "abstract": "High protein (HP) diet consumption may adversely affect metabolic acidosis and hepatic and renal health. Despite such potentially adverse effect, there are only few studies analyzing the effects of resistance training on the parameters that could be altered by such diets. A total of 32 adult male Wistar rats were randomly distributed in 4 experimental groups (n = 8): normoprotein or HP diets, with or without resistance training. Diets were based on a whey protein hydrolyzate, and the experimental period lasted for 90 days. Consumption of HP diets and resistance training significantly affected food intake, body composition and plasmatic levels of total cholesterol and triglycerides. Consumption of HP diets led to a considerable increase in liver and kidney weight (P < 0.001), urinary volume and acidity, as well as in the urinary excretion of Ca, with a parallel reduction in the urinary excretion of citrate (P < 0.05). The buffering action of resistance training on such diet-induced alterations was especially evident in the levels of hepatic and plasma triglycerides, plasmatic urea, and in liver and kidney weight (P < 0.001). Resistance training had a protective action against alterations of hepatic and renal health status and some metabolic parameters like hepatic and plasma triglycerides.",

    "title": "High Burden of Premature Ventricular Contractions Upregulates Transcriptional Markers of Inflammation and Promotes Adverse Cardiac Remodeling Linked to Cardiomyopathy.",
    "abstract": "Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) are the most prevalent ventricular arrhythmia in adults. High PVC burden can lead to left ventricular systolic dysfunction, eccentric hypertrophy, and an increased risk of heart failure and sudden cardiac death. Inadequate angiogenesis is a key determinant in the transition from adaptive to maladaptive cardiac hypertrophy, and fibrosis is a risk factor for arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death. We quantitatively assessed structural remodeling and transcriptional alterations in PVC-induced cardiomyopathy (PVC-CM). Animals were implanted with modified pacemakers to deliver bigeminal PVCs (200-220 ms coupling interval) for 12 weeks. Collagen deposition and interstitial ultrastructure of left ventricular samples were analyzed using light and transmission electron microscopy, respectively. Pericytes, fibroblasts, myocytes, smooth muscle, and endothelial cells were imaged using confocal microscopy, quantified with an artificial intelligence-based segmentation analysis, and compared using hierarchical statistics. Transcriptional changes were assessed via RNAseq, and protein expression was assessed using western blot. Although cardiomyocytes hypertrophied in PVC-CM, capillary rarefaction was overcome by an increase in the capillary-to-myocyte ratio. Additionally, thicker blood vessels were more abundant in PVC-CM. Fibroblast-to-myocyte ratio more than doubled, interstitial collagen fibers increased, and interstitial space thickened in PVC-CM. Transcripts involved in interstitial remodeling, inflammatory response, and alarmins were strongly elevated in PVC-CM, showing enrichment of NF-κB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) transcriptional signature. These results coincide with elevated levels of the proinflammatory cytokine IL (interleukin)‑1β, the inflammasome component NLRP3 (nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich repeat family, pyrin domain containing 3), and increased expression of NF‑κB p65 (RelA). Although the angiogenic response meets the metabolic demands of cardiac hypertrophy, upregulated markers of inflammation and cardiomyopathy linked to reactive fibrosis collectively represent an adverse left ventricular remodeling in PVC-CM that could provide the substrate for heart failure, arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death in PVC-CM.",

    "title": "Sex differences in cachexia outcomes and branched-chain amino acid metabolism following chemotherapy in aged mice.",
    "abstract": "Cachexia is a complex muscle wasting syndrome that affects the majority of hospitalized cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. It is often unresponsive to nutritional interventions, including provision of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs: leucine, isoleucine and valine). BCAAs are anabolic for skeletal muscle. We wondered whether their ineffectiveness in managing cachexia might be related to altered metabolism of these amino acids, a subject that has received minimal attention. Because estrogen limits BCAA catabolism, we hypothesized that the effects of chemotherapy on cachexia in old mice would be worse in males compared to females, and that this would be related to greater tissue release of the BCAAs in males. To better reflect the age population for which cachexia is an issue, we treated aged male and female mice (18 ± 2 months) with the chemotherapy drug cocktail FOLFIRI (50 mg/kg 5-fluorouracil (5FU), 90 mg/kg Leucovorin, and 24 mg/kg CPT11) or vehicle twice per week for 6 weeks. This cocktail is used in treating colon cancer. Metabolism and concentrations of the BCAAs and their metabolites were measured in plasma and tissues. There was a main effect of chemotherapy, reflected in reduced body weight, skeletal muscle, myofibrillar protein content, anabolic signalling and protein synthesis. In response to chemotherapy, males showed worsened outcomes for skeletal muscle weight and ubiquitinated proteins; they also had higher total plasma BCAAs but reduced muscle BCAAs. There was a main effect of chemotherapy in reducing the expression of the BCAA transporter LAT1. In response to chemotherapy, gastrocnemius muscle of males but not females had reduced inhibitory phosphorylation of BCKD-E1αser293, corresponding with increased activity of this enzyme. Chemotherapy reduced muscle and liver ketoacids of the BCAAs only in females. These data suggest that sex differences in BCAA catabolism may be linked to the severity of chemotherapy-induced muscle damage and interventions against cachexia need to take this into account.",

    "title": "ChREBP deficiency aggravates diabetic sarcopenia by disrupting glucose signaling: a novel mouse model of muscle atrophy.",
    "abstract": "Diabetes is an increasingly prevalent global disease and is often accompanied by sarcopenia, particularly in older adults. While insulin resistance is a well-known contributor to muscle loss in diabetes, the role of glucose signaling in diabetic skeletal muscle atrophy, particularly under insulin-deficient conditions, remains poorly understood. This study aimed to elucidate the pathophysiological role of the carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein (ChREBP), a glucose-sensing transcription factor encoded by the Chrebp gene in mice, in diabetic sarcopenia by generating Chrebp-deficient, insulin-deficient Ins2Akita/+ mice. We evaluated Chrebp +/+, Chrebp -/-, Ins2Akita/+ /Chrebp +/+, and Ins2Akita/+ /Chrebp -/- mice for muscle strength, endurance, survival, body composition, and muscle histology. Skeletal muscles were analyzed for gene expressions related to anabolic and catabolic pathways. We found that Ins2Akita/+ /Chrebp -/- mice exhibited significant reductions in body weight, grip strength, survival, and skeletal muscle mass - particularly in the tibialis anterior, soleus, gastrocnemius, and quadriceps - compared to Ins2Akita/+ controls, despite similar hyperglycemia. Histological analysis revealed a smaller mean muscle fiber size and reduced cross-sectional area of type 2A and 2B fibers, without changes in fiber-type composition. Furthermore, Igf-1 expression was suppressed, while the atrophy marker Fbxo32/Atrogin-1 was upregulated. These findings demonstrate that Chrebp deletion exacerbates muscle atrophy and frailty in insulin-deficient mice, underscoring a key role for ChREBP-mediated glucose signaling in maintaining muscle mass under diabetic conditions. The Ins2Akita/+ /Chrebp -/- model provides a valuable platform for exploring diabetic sarcopenia mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "β-Hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate (HMB), a metabolite of leucine, increases both protein synthesis and lipolysis, immune function, and overall health in both humans and animals. Previous cattle studies have shown that HMB, fed as calcium HMB (CaHMB), can minimize stress responses and improve meat quality. The objective of the present study was to investigate the effect of feeding CaHMB in a subtropical feedlot on performance of Nellore (Bos indicus) bulls. A total of 3,520 bulls (64 pens; 55 animals per pen) were studied with four levels of CaHMB (0 (control, CON), 3, 5, or 7 g per head per day) and half the pens had shade access (SH), and half did not in a split-plot experimental design. Diets containing CaHMB were fed during three phases of the study, adaptation, growth, and finishing. There were no CaHMB x SH interactions observed for any variable measured. However, adjusted final body weight (FBW) tended to increase in CaHMB-treated bulls up to 5.8 kg in bulls fed 3 g per day (linear P < 0.07). Additionally, adjusted average daily gain (ADG) and carcass ADG were also increased with 3 g per day CaHMB by 3.2% and 2.6%, respectively, when compared with CON (linear P < 0.04). Bulls fed CaHMB tended to have increased hot carcass weight (HCW) by up to 3.4 kg in bulls fed 3 g CaHMB per day and a 0.36% increase in dressing percentage (DP) (linear P < 0.07 and 0.09, respectively). No differences were observed in dry matter intake (DMI) during any of the feeding periods. No significant differences were observed in gain: feed. Of major importance to the subtropical environment, 34% of the days were considered hot to very hot with the comfort level (InCI) >0.45 on a 0 to 1.0 scale. In conclusion, supplementing Bos indicus bulls with CaHMB resulted in improved growth performance and carcass yield. Improving beef cattle efficiency has an impact on overall food production efficiency. The leucine metabolite, β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate (HMB), has been shown to improve muscle protein metabolism in several species including humans. Previously CaHMB has also been shown to improve immune function and reduce stress which could also improve performance of beef cattle in the feedlot. Bos indicus bulls were received in a subtropical feedlot in Brazil and placed on diets containing HMB in the calcium salt form (CaHMB). In this study, cattle were fed in pens without shade and with shade, as providing shade has been shown to also improve feedlot performance in this environment. This study suggests that feeding 3 g CaHMB per head per d, with access to shade, increased body weight and meat yield. Thus, production efficiency was improved, resulting in more meat output and possibly a greater return for the producer.",

    "abstract": "Resistance training (RT) is an effective intervention for improving muscle health and metabolism in ageing, but the degree of responsiveness (hypertrophy) to RT varies substantially. We examined muscle metabolomic profiles before and after 10-weeks RT in older adults classified into upper (UPPER) and lower (LOWER) tertiles of hypertrophy to identify key metabolic adaptation differences. Fifty older adults (23 males, 27 females, mean 68.2 years old) completed 10 weeks of RT combined with whey protein supplementation. Quadriceps cross-sectional area (CSA) was assessed via magnetic resonance imaging before and after RT. Participants were grouped into UPPER (n = 25, 10.3 ± 2% CSA increase) or LOWER (n = 25, 3.3 ± 2% CSA increase) based on ranked CSA changes. We profiled skeletal muscle tissues from the UPPER and LOWER groups using a metabolomics platform. Over 2,500 metabolites were mapped to 104 metabolic pathways. In the UPPER group, upregulation of tryptophan-indole metabolites and the kynurenine pathway suggests a potential role of gut function and anti-inflammatory effect on RT-induced hypertrophy. Also, leucine, isoleucine and valine were significantly upregulated in the absence of their catabolites. Enrichment of urea cycle/amino group metabolism alongside mitochondria-matrix metabolites in the UPPER group indicates improved amino acids and energy homeostasis. Our findings highlight distinct RT-induced skeletal muscle metabolic profiles between UPPER and LOWER in older adults, underscoring the value of metabolic data. These metabolic pathways are important for understanding what contributes to the heterogeneity of hypertrophic response to RT in older adults.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the effect of leucine-rich high protein supplementation on body composition, muscle function and gene expression among older adults with or at risk of sarcopenia residing in Klang Valley, Malaysia. A total of 47 participants were recruited into this 12-week double-blinded, randomized controlled trial. Intervention group consumed 2 sachets of high protein supplement daily contributing to 50.6 g of protein/day and 6 g of leucine/day. Control group received placebo supplement. Body composition was assessed via anthropometry measurements, bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of left mid-thigh. Meanwhile, muscle function was assessed using short physical performance battery (SPPB). A total of 16 ml of full blood was collected pre- and post- study to assess participants' health profiling and changes in gene expression as determined by mitochondrial RNA activity derived from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The measurements were performed at 0, 6, and 12 weeks. Participants were mostly women (89.4%) with a mean age of 69.3 ± 7.1 years. Repeated measures ANOVA showed no significant intervention effect in body composition (anthropometry measurements and BIA) as well as muscle function (SPPB score). However, genes responsible for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production (GBA, MLYCD), cell proliferation (STAT5A) and DNA repair (BRCC3) were significantly up-regulated in intervention group (p < 0.05). Leucine-rich high protein supplementation did not produce significant changes in body composition or muscle function in older adults with sarcopenia. However, it showed potential in improving gene expression. Further studies with a longer supplementation period and a larger sample size might be needed for noticeable changes, particularly for body composition.",

    "abstract": "In the face of population aging, sarcopenia has emerged as a significant muscle disorder characterized by the progressive loss of muscle mass, strength, and function. Chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction contribute to sarcopenia and help explain its association with comorbidities such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, and neurodegenerative diseases. Despite extensive research, there remains a need to integrate current knowledge on interventions that target these interconnected mechanisms. This review synthesizes recent evidence on the effects of resistance exercise, nutritional supplementation (high-protein intake, leucine, vitamin D, omega-3 fatty acids), and probiotic use on muscle function and inflammatory status in older adults with sarcopenia. Literature was critically analyzed to evaluate the efficacy of multicomponent strategies. The reviewed studies consistently report that combining resistance training with anti-inflammatory nutrition and targeted supplementation improves muscle strength, reduces pro-inflammatory cytokines, and supports mitochondrial function. These findings suggest that an integrated, multicomponent approach represents a promising strategy for attenuating the progression of sarcopenia and reducing its associated comorbidities.",

    "abstract": "Preterm (PT) infants are at increased risk for reduced postnatal lean mass accretion. We established that the feeding-induced stimulation of protein synthesis in skeletal muscle is blunted in piglets born PT compared with those born at term. We evaluated the extent to which key components of the amino acid-sensing pathways that regulate mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) activation contribute to anabolic resistance in skeletal muscle of piglets born PT compared with those born term. Piglets delivered by cesarean section 10 d PT (n = 23) or at term (n = 22) were administered total parenteral nutrition for 3 d. On day 4, euinsulinemic-euaminoacidemic-euglycemic (FAST group), hyperinsulinemic-euaminoacidemic-euglycemic (INS group), or euinsulinemic-hyperaminoacidemic-euglycemic (AA group) clamps were performed for 2 h. Abundances and activation of amino acid signaling components in skeletal muscle were analyzed by immunoblotting. Abundances of amino acid transporters LAT1/SLC7A5 (leucine), SLC38A9 (arginine), and SNAT2/SLC38A2 (glutamine) were unaffected by prematurity. Sestrin1- and Sestrin2-GATOR2 abundances were reduced (P < 0.05) by AA, consistent with leucine-induced dissociation of these inhibitory complexes; prematurity blunted this effect for Sestrin1-GATOR2 (P < 0.05). SAR1B, but not LARS-mTOR, leucine-sensor abundances were lower in PT than term animals (P < 0.05). TARS2 (threonine) and RAB1A (branched-chain amino acid) sensor abundances were lower in PT (P < 0.05). Arginine (CASTOR1-GATOR2), methionine (SAMTOR-GATOR1), and glutamine (ARF1) sensor abundances were unaffected by prematurity. AA-induced formations of RagA- and RagC-mTOR complexes were attenuated in PT compared with term piglets (P < 0.05). Both AA and INS stimulated mTORC1 phosphorylation, but these effects were blunted by prematurity. PT birth impairs the abundance and activation of multiple amino acid-sensing components upstream of mTORC1 in skeletal muscle. This disruption attenuates amino acid-induced mTORC1-dependent translation initiation and protein synthesis and likely contributes to the anabolic resistance, reduced lean mass, and extrauterine growth faltering frequently observed in premature infants.",

    "title": "Effects of Replacing Soybean Meal With Degossypolized Cottonseed Protein on the Growth Performance, Protein Metabolism, Digestive Capacity, and Antioxidant Capacity of Hybrid Fish Hefang Bream.",
    "abstract": "An 8-week feeding trial was conducted to evaluate the feasibility of substituting soybean meal (SBM) with degossypolized cottonseed protein (DCP) on Hefang bream. Five iso-nitrogenous and iso-lipidic diets were formulated with graded replacement levels of SBM by DCP at 0% (control), 25% (DCP25), 50% (DCP50), 75% (DCP75), and 100% (DCP100). Results showed that DCP could effectively replace up to 50% of dietary SBM in Hefang bream, without adverse influence on survival rate and growth performance. However, the specific growth rate in fish fed diets with DCP replacing 75% and 100% of SBM decreased significantly. Muscle essential amino acid profiles showed marked reductions in isoleucine, leucine, and lysine concentrations in fish fed diets with DCP replacing 75% and 100% of SBM, correlating with suppressed mTOR pathway transcription. The intestinal villi length and the intestinal trypsin activity in fish fed diets with DCP replacing 75% and 100% of SBM were significantly lower than those in the control group. The total antioxidant capacity and catalase activity in fish fed the diet with DCP replacing 100% of SBM were significantly lower than those in the control group. The mRNA expression of hepatic inflammatory cytokines in fish fed the diet with DCP replacing 25% of SBM was the lowest among the groups. In conclusion, these findings suggest that DCP can replace up to 50% of SBM in diets of the Hefang bream without compromising the growth performance. However, excessive dietary DCP (75%-100%) can induce protein utilization impairment, digestive dysfunction, oxidative stress, and hepatic inflammation.",

    "abstract": "Aging is related to a decline in muscle mass, cognitive capabilities, and exercise proficiency, all of which collectively diminish quality of life and heighten the susceptibility to chronic illnesses. Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), with specific emphasis on leucine, have surfaced as pivotal regulators of muscle metabolism and may significantly influence the muscle-brain metabolic axis, thereby affecting hippocampal plasticity and cognitive wellbeing. This review consolidates contemporary evidence from 21 clinical and experimental investigations examining the influences of BCAA intake in conjunction with exercise on muscle functionality, cognitive outcomes, and endurance capacity in conditions associated with aging. The results indicate that BCAA supplementation, particularly when augmented with leucine and combined with resistance or multicomponent exercise regimens, facilitates muscle protein synthesis, mitigates inflammation, and enhances physical performance in the elderly population. Initial data also suggest possible advantages for hippocampal plasticity and cognitive function; however, this domain necessitates further investigation. The presence of challenges such as variability in study methodologies, supplementation regimens, and demographic characteristics of participants constrains the ability to draw definitive conclusions. Subsequent research endeavors ought to concentrate on clarifying the mechanistic pathways that connect muscular and cognitive health, refining supplementation methodologies, and investigating tailored strategies to alleviate age-associated sarcopenia and cognitive deterioration. In summary, the combination of BCAAs with physical exercise presents a potentially effective intervention to facilitate healthy aging through the interconnected metabolic axis of muscle and brain.",

    "abstract": "NADPH oxidase organizer 1 (NoxO1) is known as a scaffold cytoplasmic subunit of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) forming Nox1 complex. We previously identified an interaction between NoxO1 and Erbin, a cytosolic scaffold protein that associates with Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), but its ROS-independent roles remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that NoxO1 overexpression remodels the endolysosomal system by expanding early endosomes and lysosomes. A calibrated six-compartment ordinary differential equation model of EGFR trafficking predicts a slowed down intracellular trafficking: NoxO1 overexpression increased internalization rates by 14 % while reducing degradative sorting by 48 %, lysosomal transfer by 24 %, and final degradation by 41 %. Using fluorescent cargo (EGF and BSA), we confirmed enhanced internalization and cargo accumulation in lysosomes, supporting the idea of prolonged lysosomal retention in NoxO1 overexpressing cells. Mechanistically, NoxO1 activated transcription factor EB (TFEB), the master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis, in an Erbin-dependent but ROS independent manner. Proximity ligation assays revealed spatial association of NoxO1, Erbin, EGFR, and TFEB, suggesting a multi-protein regulatory complex. Genetic ablation of Erbin abolished NoxO1-induced increases in early endosome (EEA1) and lysosome (LAMP1) markers, confirming Erbin's essential role. In conclusion, via its interaction with Erbin NoxO1 promotes activation of TFEB, contributes to lysosome formation while delaying cargo degradation.",

    "abstract": "The relationship between depression and hypertension has garnered increasing scholarly attention, particularly regarding the role of depression in exacerbating organ damage in hypertensive individuals. Inflammation is a key characteristic of organ damage associated with elevated blood pressure. However, the specific impact of inflammation on vascular dysfunction in hypertensive rats with depression has yet to be fully understood. This study examines the effects of the NF-κB inhibitor MG132 on blood pressure, depression-like behaviors, endothelial function, and vascular remodeling in hypertensive rats exhibiting depressive symptoms. The administration of MG132 resulted in a significant reduction in blood pressure and an improvement in depressive behaviors among these rats. Furthermore, MG132 treatment led to a notable decrease in serum levels of Angiotensin II (AngⅡ) and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), while increasing nitric oxide (NO) levels in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and those with chronic depression. Additionally, MG132 inhibited the differentiation of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) into smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and reduced the levels of inflammatory cytokines, including high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β). Moreover, MG132 effectively suppressed the expression of NF-κB P65 and its downstream signaling pathway, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1).",

In C2C12 myotubes, DEX suppressed anabolic signaling (mTOR, p-Akt, PI3K, p-S6K1, TRPV4) and upregulated catabolic mediators (FOXO3, MuRF1, Atrogin-1, Cathepsin L, REDD2). Fucoidan mainly suppressed catabolic signaling, peptides enhanced anabolic pathways, and their combination synergistically restored protein turnover. In a DEX-induced mouse model, the combined treatment significantly preserved muscle weight, improved strength and endurance, and protected myofiber morphology, exceeding the effects of either treatment alone or leucine. Compositional profiling confirmed that fucoidan was enriched in fucose and sulfate, whereas grouper peptides were abundant in branched-chain amino acids and bioactive dipeptides, supporting their complementary mechanisms. These findings demonstrate that fucoidan and grouper-derived peptides exert distinct yet synergistic effects on muscle protein homeostasis, highlighting their translational potential as safe, mechanism-based interventions for preventing and treating muscle-wasting conditions such as sarcopenia, cachexia, and glucocorticoid-induced atrophy.",

    "abstract": "Skeletal muscle accounts for approximately 40% of body mass and 50%-75% of whole-body protein, playing a central role in meat production and quality. Efficient protein synthesis in skeletal muscle relies on an adequate supply of nutrient substrates and a balanced amino acid profile. Branched-chain amino acids (BCAA), including leucine (Leu), isoleucine (Ile), and valine (Val), are the most abundant essential amino acids in skeletal muscle and contribute to both protein synthesis and oxidative energy production. Additionally, BCAA function as signaling molecules that regulate gene expression and protein phosphorylation cascades, which significantly influence physiological processes, such as protein synthesis and degradation, glucose and lipid metabolism, and cell apoptosis and autophagy. These processes are primarily mediated through the PI3K/AKT/AMPK/mTOR signaling pathways. This review summarizes BCAA transporters and catabolic metabolism, their role as signaling molecules in regulating protein metabolism and glucose and lipid equilibrium, and applications in animal production. These findings offer both theoretical insights and practical guidelines for the precise regulation of feed efficiency and production performance through tailored dietary BCAA supplementations.",

    "abstract": "Muscle wasting is frequently observed in critically ill patients, leading to increased rates of complications and mortality, and could be determined by measuring the quadriceps femoris muscle thickness (QFMT). One significant contributing factor is inflammation, with interleukin-6 (IL-6) as one of the important markers. Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), especially leucine, enhance muscle protein synthesis, and reduce inflammation. This study examined the effects of high leucine BCAA supplementation on QFMT and IL-6 levels in critically ill patients. This multicentre, double-blind, randomised controlled trial was conducted in two hospitals in Indonesia from December 2023 to May 2024. Recently admitted critically ill patients were randomly assigned to receive 40 g/day of BCAA (19 g/day of leucine, with a ratio of leucine : isoleucine : valine = 2:1:1.2) supplementation, either enterally or partial parenterally, for 10 days, or to a control group. QFMT was measured using an ultrasound (US), and IL-6 serum levels were measured at baseline and day 10. We performed a linear mixed model to analyse the effects of other factors on outcomes. Forty participants were included in this study; most (78 %) were male, median age 49 (21), and had a surgical diagnosis (55 %). Patients in both groups had similar initial QFMT and IL-6 levels. On day 10 of the study, loss of muscle thickness was found to be less prominent in the BCAA than the control group (0 vs. -13 %, p = 0.001), and the BCAA group showed a significant reduction in IL-6 levels than control (-59.1 vs. 126.5 pg/mL, p = 0.012). Supplementing critically ill patients with high leucine BCAA potentially attenuates muscle mass loss and reduces IL-6 levels. NCT06167772.",

    "abstract": "Essential (EAA) and branched chain (BCAA) amino acid ingestion support whole-body anabolism after resistance exercise and can attenuate markers of postexercise myofibrillar protein breakdown (i.e. urinary 3-methylhistidine; 3MH). Leucine is often considered a primary anabolic EAA through its ability to activate the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and stimulate muscle protein synthesis. The dipeptide leucine (dileucine) has been shown to more effectively stimulate myofibrillar protein synthesis than leucine in young males at rest. Therefore, we aimed to determine the effect of a dileucine-containing essential amino acid formula (DIEAA; 2 g dileucine, 1 g leucine, 9.15 g total EAA) on the anabolic and catabolic responses following resistance exercise in young recreationally active adults when compared with ingesting branched chain amino acids (BCAA; 3 g leucine, 1.5 g isoleucine, 1.5 g valine) or isonitrogenous (to DIEAA) collagen hydrolysate (COL). In a randomized, double-blind, crossover design, 12 healthy adults (8 M, 4F, aged 24 ± 3 y) performed a 60 min bout of whole-body resistance exercise, after which they ingested DIEAA, BCAA, or COL protein beverages containing 100 mg L-[1- Total exogenous leucine retention were similar ( Dileucine-supplemented EAA and BCAA support greater whole-body anabolism compared with COL after resistance exercise independent of attenuation in urinary estimates of myofibrillar protein breakdown.

    "abstract": "Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive interstitial lung disease. It is currently difficult to treat, with limited treatment options available. Recent evidence implicates ferroptosis-an iron-dependent form of regulated cell death-as a critical pathogenic mechanism in pulmonary fibrogenesis. Empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, which have been proven to have anti-fibrotic effects on various organ systems, however, there are few studies on the mechanism of action of the drug in pulmonary fibrosis. Utilizing a bleomycin-induced murine model and MLg fibroblasts/MLE12 alveolar epithelial cells, we conducted multi-parametric assessment of fibrotic markers (Alpha smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), Collagen I), ferroptosis markers (intracellular iron, lipid peroxidation), and key regulatory proteins. Empagliflozin treatment significantly attenuated pulmonary collagen deposition and myofibroblast activation in vivo, while demonstrating dual anti-ferroptotic effects in vitro: reducing excessive iron accumulation and lipid peroxidation in MLg cells, while restoring glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) expression in ferroptosis-sensitive MLE12 cells. Mechanistically, empagliflozin upregulates the expression of transcription factor EB (TFEB) post TGF-β1 challenge, initiating coordinated regulation of ferroptosis mediators. TFEB knockdown exacerbated ferroptosis through GPX4 suppression and Acyl-CoA Synthetase Long Chain Family Member 4 (ACSL4) induction, whereas TFEB overexpression reversed these effects. We confirmed TFEB-mediated transcriptional upregulation of GPX4 coupled with ACSL4 suppression as the molecular basis for empagliflozin's anti-fibrotic action. These findings establish empagliflozin as a novel therapeutic strategy for IPF through TFEB-driven modulation of ferroptosis pathways, providing experimental basis for repurposing SGLT2 inhibitors in fibrotic lung diseases.",

    "title": "Current Perspectives on Protein Supplementation in Athletes: General Guidance and Special Considerations for Diabetes-A Narrative Review.",
    "abstract": "Proteins elicit various metabolic and physiological functions that are related to physical performance. Due to increased need in athletes, protein supplementation has been widely used to support recovery and performance. However, the extent to which acute gains in muscle protein synthesis translate into measurable performance remains debated. This narrative review synthesizes evidence from trials on supplemental proteins across resistance, endurance, and mixed-modality training, comparing sources (whey, casein, soy, pea, and blends). Moreover, this review summarizes dosing and timing strategies, with notes for master, diabetic, and female athletes. It is well-established that supplemental protein enhances fat-free mass and, to a lesser extent, strength when baseline dietary protein is suboptimal. However, the effects are smaller when habitual intake already meets athletic targets. Whey, as a rapid protein and rich in leucine, reliably elicits an acute anabolic response, while casein provides prolonged elevated aminoacidemia. When total intake and leucine thresholds are matched, plant proteins and blends can yield comparable long-term adaptations. In addition, studies showed that the distribution and strategic timing around exercise (post-exercise first, with optional pre-sleep casein or blends) support recovery during high-frequency training or energy deficit. Protein co-ingested with carbohydrate in endurance and high-intensity functional training (HIFT) can also help glycogen restoration and attenuate muscle-damage markers, though effects on sport outcomes are inconsistent. The evidence in diabetic athletes is limited; guidance extrapolates from diabetes and athlete studies, with benefits apparent when intake, quality, or distribution are limited. Furthermore, evidence indicates that anabolic resistance in master athletes requires higher per-meal doses and distribution, with post-exercise and pre-sleep feedings valuable. Consistently, female athletes partaking in aerobic and resistance training while supplementing with protein demonstrate desired body composition adaptations. Overall, although supplemental protein helps close gaps between intake and physiological demand, various factors may influence its regimen. Protein source may help the kinetics balance, amino-acid profile, and dietary preferences. Alternatively, timing may influence the protein effects on training and recovery.",

    "abstract": "Anabolic resistance, consisting of a diminished ability of aging muscle to respond to anabolic stimuli such as exercise and protein intake, is a key contributor to age-related declines in muscle mass. However, diseases and lifestyle factors associated with aging, including insulin resistance states, overweight/obesity, persistent inflammation and specifically-as a focus herein-physical inactivity and inadequate dietary protein-intake habits, might interact with chronological impairments in muscle anabolism. In this context, master athletes, as individuals who have engaged in lifelong structured exercise, including regular training and sports participation, offer a valuable model for studying processes of chronological vs. inactivity-related aging. While these lifelong exercisers may present improved body composition parameters and other potential benefits in terms of muscle mass and function, it remains unclear whether exercise practice throughout life can prevent the development of anabolic resistance associated with aging. Albeit limited, evidence has indicated that even in lifelong-trained older individuals there is a blunted post-exercise muscle anabolic response compared to younger athletes. However, there is a paucity of data to systematically understand the differences in postprandial anabolic response to varying protein doses in older vs. young athletes. In lieu of the above, it seems reasonable that master athletes may benefit from increasing protein intake closer to the upper limit of current recommendations (1.6-2.0 g/kg/day). In addition, supplementing their diet with ingredients that have established anabolic potential, including branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) such as leucine, the leucine metabolite β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate (HMB), and n3-polyunsaturated fatty acids (n3-PUFA), may potentiate the anabolic response to protein and exercise.",

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a genetic, progressive neuromuscular disease caused by mutations in the dystrophin protein which compromise the integrity of the sarcolemma. Current care of DMD involves both supportive and targeted disease modifying medications. Obestatin, a peptide derived from preproghrelin, is a potential candidate to enhance existing treatments for DMD. This study was conducted to analyse the molecular mechanism by which obestatin acts on myofiber metabolism and muscle restructuring in DMD. Through human and animal models of DMD, we identify the calcium-activated protein phosphatase 3 (PPP3) as key node in obestatin signalling for restoration of muscle homeostasis and activation of membrane repair. In particular, we describe how obestatin signalling recovers muscle function by coordinated activation of the transcription factor EB (TFEB) and the nuclear factor of activated T cell (NFATc1) in which PPP3 is a core component. TFEB dephosphorylation triggers its nuclear translocation and the activation of macroautophagic/autophagic and mitochondrial biogenesis. NFATc1 promotes the slow myofiber phenotype fibre marker utrophin. Overall, obestatin treatment ameliorates distinctive dystrophic features of DMD, including muscle contractile damage, elevated serum creatine kinase levels, and reduced muscle force. Hence, obestatin represents a promising therapeutic approach for treating DMD, not only as monotherapy but also as part of combinatorial treatment strategies aimed at overcoming the barriers that limit the efficacy of gene or cell therapy.",

    "abstract": "Excessive muscle protein synthesis causes skeletal muscle hypertrophy. Essential amino acids are substrates for muscle proteins and stimulate muscle protein synthesis. Several essential amino acids are taken up into muscle cells through L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1). However, LAT1 may influence protein synthesis in an amino acid uptake-independent manner. Here, we investigated the effects of LAT1 inhibition on protein synthesis in C2C12 myotubes and the associated mechanisms. JPH203 (50 μM), a selective inhibitor of LAT1, stimulated protein synthesis without changing expression of phosphorylated p70S6K (T389) and 4EBP1 (T37/46), an indicator of mTORC1 activity. Culturing in amino acid-free media did not suppress JPH203-induced protein synthesis. The mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin (100 nM) did not suppress JPH203-induced protein synthesis. ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitor AZD8055 (1 μM) suppressed JPH203-induced protein synthesis. JPH203 treatment increased intracellular glutamine concentration. These results suggest that inhibition of LAT1 function augments muscle protein synthesis, possibly through the activation of rapamycin-insensitive mTOR signaling; elevated intracellular glutamine levels may contribute to the enhancement of muscle protein synthesis induced by LAT1 inhibition.",

    "title": "The Effect of Leucine-Enriched β-Lactoglobulin Versus an Isonitrogenous Whey Protein Isolate on Skeletal Muscle Protein Anabolism in Young Healthy Males.",
    "abstract": "β-lactoglobulin (BLG) is a protein found within whey protein (WP) that is rich in essential amino acids, most notably, leucine (LEU). LEU is considered the most potent EAA in the postprandial stimulation of muscle protein synthesis (MPS), such that suboptimal protein/essential amino acid (EAA) doses containing higher LEU content elicit muscle anabolism comparable to larger protein doses. Our objective was to test the effects of naturally LEU-rich BLG (~10 g protein) versus isonitrogenous whey protein isolate (WPI, ~10 g) on MPS. Ten healthy young men (26 ± 2 y; 179 ± 2 cm; 81 ± 3 kg) received BLG (1.57 g LEU) or WPI (1.02 g LEU) in a randomised double-blind cross-over fashion. A primed constant intravenous infusion of [1,2  Plasma EAA, branched-chain amino acid (BCAA), and LEU concentrations increased rapidly following both protein supplements but exhibited a significantly greater EAA/BCAA/leucinemia following BLG ( Both BLG and WPI effectively stimulated MPS doses in young healthy males, with BLG offering an advantage in EAA/BCAA/LEU bioavailability. It follows that future research should explore the potential of BLG in populations exhibiting anabolic resistance and exercise anabolism deficiency, such as older adults as well as frail and clinical populations, to assess its utility in preserving muscle mass under conditions of suboptimal protein intake.",

    "abstract": "The impact of combining animal and plant protein sources on digestibility is unclear, despite their increasing clinical use. Using a non-invasive dual stable isotope tracer approach, we assessed the digestibility, bioavailability and utilization of distinct protein blends in older adults, and associated plasma amino acid profiles and muscle protein synthesis (MPS) rates. Thirty-two older men (69 ± 3 y) consumed one of four protein blends (A (51:49, casein/soy); B and C (35:25:20:20, whey/casein/soy/pea); D (80:20, casein/whey)) alongside primed constant infusions of [1,2- No differences ( These findings suggest that protein quantity (and/or leucine content), rather than composition, appears to be the most important factor driving MPS.

    "abstract": "Sarcopenia impairs self-care ability in older adults. While branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs)/leucine enhance muscle protein synthesis and resistance training promotes muscle growth, the combined effect on sarcopenia remains unclear. This meta-analysis evaluates whether combining resistance training with BCAA-rich supplements synergistically improves body composition and function in sarcopenic elders. We systematically searched four databases and analyzed outcomes using Stata 18.0. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) were calculated via random-effects models. Twelve randomized trials (n = 459) were included. Only skeletal muscle index significantly improved with combined intervention vs. control (SMD = 0.337, 95 % CI [0.035,0.639], p = 0.029). No significant differences were found in: hand grip strength (SMD = 0.289, p = 0.080), 30-s chair stand (SMD = -0.794, p = 0.169), SPPB (SMD = -0.321, p = 0.124), walking speed (SMD = 0.344, p = 0.283), knee extension strength (SMD = 0.332,p = 0.328), total lean mass (SMD = 0.024, p = 0.908), or fat mass (SMD = -0.036, p = 0.866; all p > 0.05). BCAA supplementation post-resistance training only increased skeletal muscle index in older adults, without improving other functional or body composition outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Protein digestion and amino acid absorption kinetics are quantifiable metrics commonly utilized to determine the quality of a protein source. This review critically evaluates recent evidence (primarily from studies that provided commonly consumed protein-rich foods) regarding the relationship between in vivo protein digestion and amino acid absorption rates with the postprandial stimulation of muscle protein synthesis (MPS), with an emphasis on healthy adults and critically ill patients. Ingested protein sources that elicit moderate amino acid bioavailability, including leucine, stimulate MPS rates to a comparable extent as protein sources that elicit high amino acid bioavailability in healthy young adults. Amino acid absorption kinetics appear to be modulated in critically ill patients, leading to a marked reduction in postprandial MPS rates. Preliminary studies demonstrate that enteral feeding of high dose free amino acids increase amino acid bioavailability to a greater extent than intact protein, leading to a positive whole-body net protein balance in critically ill patients. However, in practice, the high osmolarity of free amino acids leads to a high prevalence of diarrhoea and thus limits the clinical application of this intervention. The enteral provision of free amino acids represents a theoretical, but not practically-relevant, clinical nutrition strategy to mitigate the catabolic response to critical illness. Future studies are warranted to establish targeted protein/amino acid-based interventions to mitigate skeletal muscle atrophy during the metabolic care of critically ill patients.",

    "abstract": "The influence of protein intake on insulin resistance, has garnered an increasing amount of interest over the past few decades. Increased provisions of dietary protein during weight loss helps preserve skeletal muscle, which as the largest organ in the human body, is responsible for 80% of insulin-stimulated glucose disposal. The postprandial influence of essential amino acids (EAAs) either alone or as part of intact proteins are regulated through leucine-induced activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) that serves to promote muscle protein synthesis and maintain skeletal muscle. High protein diets and/or EAA supplementation have also been demonstrated to improve satiety and augment mitochondrial function, which may have an indirect or direct influence on insulin sensitivity. On the other hand, chronic elevations in postabsorptive concentrations of branched chains amino acids (BCAAs) have been associated with chronic activation of the mTOR pathway, impairing insulin action. It appears that causal links between BCAAs and the pathogenesis of insulin resistance are reliant on chronic hyperinsulinemia and nutrient overload that foster chronic lipotoxicity. Conversely, postprandial elevations in EAAs leverage sensing as an anabolic mediator to facilitate muscle remodeling, augment satiety and improve metabolic regulation.",

    "title": "Smooth Muscle LRRC8A Knockout Preserves Vascular Function in Ang II Hypertension.",
    "abstract": "Ang II (angiotensin II) causes hypertension and vascular inflammation both directly and indirectly via cytokines, including TNFα (tumor necrosis factor-α). In vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), Ang II and TNFα activate Nox1 (NADPH oxidase 1) to produce superoxide. TNFα receptors associate with Nox1 and LRRC8A (leucine-rich repeat containing 8A) anion channels to modulate inflammation and contractility in a RhoA-dependent manner. VSMC-specific LRRC8A knockout mesenteric arteries are protected from TNFα-induced injury, and vasodilation is preserved. We hypothesized that LRRC8A knockout would preserve vascular function and decrease blood pressure (BP) in Ang II-infused mice. Wild-type and knockout mice received Ang II infusions for 14 days. BP was measured by radiotelemetry, and aortic and mesenteric artery function was measured by wire myography. VSMCs were isolated from male wild-type and knockout mice. Systolic BP was not different, but knockout mice had more BP dipping during inactive periods at baseline, and dipping was preserved after Ang II. The function of knockout aortic and mesenteric vessels was less impaired by Ang II, as reflected by less augmented contraction to norepinephrine and serotonin and preserved relaxation to acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside. Western blotting revealed increased soluble guanylate cyclase alpha and reduced CPI-17 in hypertensive knockout aortae. Consistent with lower Rho kinase activity, phosphorylation of ERM (ezrin/radixin/moesin) and cofilin was reduced in knockout VSMCs. Ang II caused less proliferation (lower PCNA [proliferating cell nuclear antigen]) and less induction of senescence in knockout vessels. LRRC8A anion channels support VSMC inflammation and the associated vascular dysfunction, which impairs BP dipping in hypertension.",

    "abstract": "Peripheral nerve injury (PNI) often results in incomplete recovery due to persistent neuroinflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction. Here, we investigated the therapeutic potential of Urolithin A (UA), a gut microbiota-derived metabolite, in promoting nerve regeneration by modulating mitophagy and inflammasome activation. To evaluate whether UA enhances peripheral nerve regeneration by activating TFEB-mediated mitophagy and inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation. In a rat sciatic nerve crush injury model and Schwann cell cultures, UA effects were evaluated using behavioral tests, histological analysis, transmission electron microscopy, immunofluorescence, Western blotting, and molecular docking. UA administration significantly improved sciatic functional index, reduced muscle atrophy, and enhanced axonal regeneration and remyelination. Mechanistically, UA promoted transcription factor EB (TFEB) nuclear translocation, upregulated autophagy-lysosomal genes, and facilitated clearance of damaged mitochondria, leading to reduced ROS levels and suppression of NLRP3 inflammasome activation. These effects were abolished by TFEB knockdown or autophagy inhibition, indicating a TFEB-dependent mechanism. Molecular docking suggested direct binding between UA and TFEB. UA facilitates peripheral nerve repair by coupling TFEB-mediated mitophagy with NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition. This dual action provides a promising non-invasive therapeutic strategy for PNI and warrants further translational research.",

    "abstract": "Endometriosis (EMS), a multifactorial and chronic benign gynecological disease characterized by ectopic endometrial growth, remains poorly understood in its pathogenesis. Proline, glutamic acid, leucine-rich protein 1 (PELP1), implicated in various diseases, has not been studied in EMS. Here, we investigated the functional role and molecular mechanisms of PELP1 in EMS progression. Using ectopic and eutopic endometrial tissues from EMS patients, we showed that PELP1 was significantly upregulated in ectopic lesions. Knockdown of PELP1 in primary ectopic endometrial stromal cells (Ec-ESCs) and the mouse model inhibited proliferation, angiogenesis, and inflammation. Mechanistically, PELP1 interacted with FHL2 to potentiate transcriptional activation of downstream factors, such as CCND1, CCND2, CDK6, ANG, CCL2, and MMP3. These findings demonstrate that PELP1 promotes EMS progression and highlight its potential as a novel therapeutic target.",

    "abstract": "Functional amino acids including glutamine and glutamate (Gln/Glu) play critical roles in supporting intestinal health, antioxidant defense, and metabolic regulation during periods of increased physiological demand, including late gestation and lactation in sows. This study evaluated the effects of Gln/Glu supplementation in sow diets during late gestation and lactation on sow performance, reproductive parameters, colostrum composition, blood biomarkers, and fecal microbiota. A total of 43 DanBred sows (parity 4.0 ± 1.7; body weight 270 ± 31 kg) were allocated using a randomized complete block design with parity and body weight as blocks and fed either a control diet or a Gln/Glu-supplemented diet (10 g/kg) from day 86 of gestation until weaning (day 21 of lactation). Sows fed the Gln/Glu-supplemented diet exhibited reduced farrowing duration (P < 0.05). Colostrum from sows fed the Gln/Glu-supplemented diet showed higher concentrations of methionine, cystine, isoleucine, leucine, alanine, and tyrosine compared to the control group (P < 0.05), with trends for increased levels of histidine (P = 0.083), glutamic acid (P = 0.081), glycine (P = 0.062), and serine (P = 0.089). A trend toward higher average daily feed intake during lactation (P = 0.089) and increased insulin concentration (P = 0.077) was also observed. Piglet weaning weight was improved (P < 0.05) in sows fed the Gln/Glu-supplemented diet. No effects were observed on gestation weight gain, lactation weight loss, backfat thickness, body condition score, or most blood biochemical and immunological parameters. The fecal bacterial load of Escherichia coli and Clostridium perfringens was unaffected by treatment. These findings suggest that supplementing sow diets with Gln/Glu during late gestation and lactation may enhance farrowing efficiency, improve colostrum amino acid content, and improve neonatal growth during lactation. The period around farrowing (birth) and lactation is incredibly demanding for sows, requiring substantial nutrient support. This study evaluated whether supplementing glutamine and glutamate (Gln/Glu) to sow diets during late pregnancy and lactation could improve sow performance and colostrum quality. We found that sows fed Gln/Glu had shorter farrowing duration, which is beneficial because quicker farrowings reduce risks for piglet survival. Although colostrum protein and fat did not differ, Gln/Glu supplementation significantly increased the concentrations of several amino acids, including branched-chain, sulfur-containing, and tyrosine. These specific amino acids are crucial for piglet growth, muscle development, and immune system strength. Ultimately, piglets from sows supplemented with Gln/Glu had higher weaning weights compared with the control group. Our results suggest that Gln/Glu supplementation in sow diets may improve the farrowing process, enhance the nutritional quality of colostrum, and improve piglets’ weaning weight, even if it doesn’t drastically change all sow performance measures.",

    "abstract": "As the building blocks of proteins and precursors of many other important compounds, amino acids play a vital role in the biochemical processes needed to sustain life. The branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) are unique in their structure and function, as they are metabolized in muscle tissue and play important roles in protein synthesis and energy production. However, despite their physiological importance, relatively little integrative research has been conducted into the direct relationships between this class of metabolites and their effect on risk for metabolic diseases. Utilizing an integrative PheWAS approach using UK Biobank data, we were able to identify strong, high confidence, metabolite-disease correlations for the three BCAAs: leucine, isoleucine, and valine. Relationships were established through comparison of metabolite level-disease prevalence associations with polygenic scores for BCAAs, followed by Mendelian randomization analysis. All BCAAs studied demonstrated especially strong relationships with type II diabetes, and robust relationships with obesity, hypertension, sleep apnea, and chronic kidney disease. We illustrate this with a set of metabolite prevalence-disease risk plots that suggest differing potential for disease based on varying levels of branched-chain amino acid metabolites. Similar results are observed with polygenic scores for plasma BCAAs. Mendelian randomization shows positive effects of leucine and isoleucine on hypertension, and either reverse causality or no clear directional relationship for other associations, notably effects of obesity and type II diabetes on all three BCAAs, with limited or borderline evidence for other outcomes. Overall, the results of our study highlight a relatively unexplored area of metabolite-disease associations and provide a blueprint for uncovering additional relationships using readily available biobank data.",

    "abstract": "Fatigue is closely associated with an impaired mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, and inefficient energy metabolism, all contributing to reduced physical performance. Nutritional strategies targeting mitochondrial biogenesis and antioxidant defense may help alleviate fatigue and enhance endurance. This study examined the anti-fatigue and antioxidant effects of an amino acid (AA)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) mixture comprised of 3 AAs (cysteine [Cys], glutamine [Gln], and leucine [Leu]) and EGCG on mitochondrial biogenesis, oxidative stress mitigation, and physical performance enhancement. C2C12 myoblasts were treated to assess mitochondrial biogenesis-related gene expression and oxidative stress markers. Animal studies measured the swimming endurance, glycogen, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and serum parameters. A pilot clinical trial evaluated the blood glucose, lactate, and serum enzyme levels post-exercise. In cellular experiments, a 1:1:3 ratio of the AA mixture (Cys, Gln, and Leu) with EGCG enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis-related gene expression (AMP-activated protein kinase, sirtuin 1, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1α [PGC-1α]) and reduced the oxidative stress markers (reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde [MDA]). Animal studies revealed significant increases in swimming endurance, elevated glycogen and ATP levels, and reduced serum fatigue markers (creatine phosphokinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and blood nitrogen). Furthermore, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) and PGC-1α expression was significantly upregulated in the gastrocnemius muscle, supporting enhanced mitochondrial function. In addition, the antioxidant effects were observed with reduced MDA levels in liver tissue. Clinical trial data showed improved blood lactate clearance and higher post-exercise blood glucose levels in the AA-EGCG group compared to the placebo group. The AA-EGCG mixture enhances mitochondrial biogenesis and antioxidant capacity by activating the NRF2 and PGC-1α pathways, improving physical performance and reducing fatigue. This study highlights its potential as a supplement for managing fatigue and enhancing endurance.",

PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar databases were searched for clinical and nonclinical studies on the effects of supplementation in adults, published between 1990 and 2025. Essential amino acids and leucine showed the most consistent associations with increased MPS and, in older adults, improvements in strength/lean mass. Branched-chain amino acids supplementation generally attenuated muscle damage/DOMS and helped preserve performance, with benefits appearing context dependent (e.g., energy restriction, high training load). Evidence for non-essential amino acids is preliminary. Signals of greater strength oriented effects in men and greater recovery benefits in women are biologically plausible but largely hypothesis-generating due to single sex cohorts and indirect cross study contrasts. Amino acid supplementation can support muscle anabolism and, in selected contexts, strength and recovery, best viewed as an adjunct to resistance training with individualized dosing/timing. Progress requires adequately powered, pre registered, sex comparative RCTs that standardize protocols and prespecify functional and structural endpoints to define dose response, timing, and durability across ages and training states.",

    "abstract": "Dynapenic obesity (DO), the co-occurrence of muscle strength loss and obesity in aging adults, exacerbates metabolic dysfunction and disability risks. While amino acid (AA) dysregulation is implicated in both conditions, their combined metabolic signature remains unexplored. We aimed to identify sex-specific amino acid metabolic patterns associated with DO in Iranian older people. In this cross-sectional study of 1,928 adults (aged 50 years or older) from the Bushehr Elderly Health Program, serum AA profiles were quantified using UPLC-MS/MS. Principal component analysis (PCA) derived four factors from 20 AAs.Dynapenia thresholds were handgrip strength < 26 kg (men) and < 18 kg (women). Abdominal obesity was defined as a waist circumference ≥ 102 cm (men) or ≥ 88 cm (women). Multinomial logistic regression was used to evaluate the associations between these factors and dynapenia/obesity phenotypes, stratified by sex and adjusted for confounders. The study included 1928 people (57.2% women; mean age 61.6 ± 7.7 years) after excluding subjects with missing values. Four distinct amino acid factors reflecting major metabolic pathways: insulin resistance with branched-chain and aromatic amino acids (Factor 1), nitrogen and methyl group metabolism (Factor 2), anabolic capacity and protein turnover (Factor 3), and urea cycle function and detoxification (Factor 4). In women, Factor 1(Leucine, Valine, Tyrosine, Alanine, Methionine, Tryptophan, and Proline) was positively linked to nondynapenic obesity [RR = 1.55 (1.15-2.08)] and DO [RR = 1.35(0.99-1.84,  This study found distinct amino acid signatures associated with dynapenia and obesity in older adults. Factor 1 highlighted the role of insulin resistance-related amino acids in obesity across both genders, while Factor 2 emphasized nitrogen metabolism and its association with muscle loss and adiposity primarily in men. Factor 3's anabolic profile suggested a complex but modest link to obesity and muscle health, and factor 4 underscored the protective effects of efficient nitrogen detoxification against obesity in women. These results reveal sex-specific metabolic pathways involved in dynapenic obesity, offering potential targets for personalized treatments to improve muscle and metabolic health in aging populations. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and explore therapeutic applications. The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s40200-025-01746-x.",

    "title": "CTRP9 as a myokine mitigates sarcopenia via the LAMP-2A/NLRP3 pathway.",
    "abstract": "Sarcopenia, a degenerative condition marked by progressive skeletal muscle atrophy and impaired regeneration, is closely associated with aging, chronic inflammation, and disrupted proteostasis. While macroautophagy has been extensively studied in this context, little of the role of chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) has been known. In this study, we identified C1q/TNF-related protein 9 (CTRP9) as a novel autocrine myokine secreted by skeletal muscle that exerts dual protective functions-pro-differentiative and anti-atrophic. By using a replicative senescence model in C2C12 myoblasts, we observed that CTRP9 expression declined with cellular aging, accompanied by reduced levels of lysosome-associated membrane protein type 2A (LAMP2A), increased nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich-containing family, and pyrin domain-containing-3 (NLRP3) accumulation, and elevated interleukin-1β (IL-1β) secretion. Similar molecular signatures were detected in skeletal muscle tissues of CTRP9 knockout (KO) mice, further validating its role in vivo. Treatment with the biologically active globular domain of CTRP9 (gCTRP9) restored LAMP2A expression, enhanced CMA activity, and promoted selective degradation of NLRP3, thereby alleviating inflammatory stress and cellular senescence. Functionally, gCTRP9 restored myogenic differentiation markers (e.g., MYOD1) while suppressing atrophy-related genes (e.g., Fbxo32) and improving fusion potential and myotube integrity. In primary human myoblasts isolated from elderly individuals, CTRP9 and LAMP2A were significantly downregulated, and NLRP3 expression was increased-changes that were partially reversed upon gCTRP9 treatment. These findings collectively demonstrate that the CTRP9-LAMP2A-NLRP3 axis plays a pivotal role in regulating both muscle regeneration and maintenance. By targeting CMA-mediated NLRP3 degradation, CTRP9 offers a promising therapeutic strategy for combating sarcopenia through coordinated modulation of differentiation pathways and muscle atrophy.",

    "abstract": "This review evaluates recent evidence on how total protein and energy intake, amino acid composition, and nutrient delivery modality influence protein synthesis in preterm neonates, with the goal of informing nutritional strategies to support optimal lean mass accretion and growth. Preterm neonates exhibit anabolic resistance to feeding due to impaired insulin and amino acid signaling in skeletal muscle. Enteral nutrition, especially fortified human milk, supports better lean mass accretion and neurodevelopment than parenteral nutrition. Intermittent bolus feeding and pulsatile leucine supplementation during continuous feeding further enhance mTORC1-dependent translation initiation signaling and protein synthesis efficiency in skeletal muscle, offering promising strategies to optimize lean tissue growth. Strategies that prioritize early enteral feeding, appropriate milk fortification, and nutrient delivery patterns that mimic feeding pulsatility may overcome anabolic resistance and enhance lean mass accretion, supporting healthy growth trajectories in preterm infants.",

    "title": "Predominant role of fat mass in the association between HMB and frailty.",
    "abstract": "β-Hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate (HMB) is a bioactive metabolite formed from the breakdown of leucine, which increases muscle protein synthesis and reduces muscle breakdown. Previous studies have shown an inverse association between HMB levels and frailty in older adults. This study aims to assess if body composition influences this association. A cross-sectional analysis was conducted using data from a cohort of adults ≥65 years from the Toledo Study of Healthy Aging. Body composition [total lean (TBLM) and fat mass (TBFM)] was assessed using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Frailty was assessed with the Frailty Trait Scale (FTS-12). Six regression models were employed to examine HMB/body composition ratios and frailty, adjusting by age, sex, comorbidity, waist-to-hip ratio, nutritional status, and Mediterranean diet adherence. Data from 1257 individuals (56.72% females, mean age 74.6 ± 5.95 years) were analyzed. Significantly higher values of HMB levels were observed in men compared to women. HMB/body composition ratios were significantly associated with frailty in both sexes. Increased HMB/TBFM ratios occurred due to both higher HMB levels (Q1: 0.155 ± 0.027 ng/mL vs Q4: 0.280 ± 0.057 ng/mL) and lower fat mass (Q1: 19.11 ± 3.12 kg/m2 vs Q4: 11.34 ± 2.44 kg/m2), whereas higher HMB/TBLM ratios were primarily driven by higher HMB levels (Q1: 0.149 ± 0.023 ng/mL vs Q4: 0.292 ± 0.05 ng/mL), whereas lean mass remained constant (Q1: 25.11 ± 2.79 kg/m2 vs Q4: 24.62 ± 2.91 kg/m2). The protective effect of the HMB/TBFM ratio was independent of the lean mass ratio. The relationship between endogenous HMB and frailty is modified by body composition, with a stronger impact mediated by fat mass than lean mass. Future studies should explore the therapeutic implications of HMB supplementation in age-related changes in body composition and frailty.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to elucidate the regulatory role of the muscle-specific gene ATP1B4 in skeletal muscle metabolism and mitophagy in diabetic sarcopenia (DS) rats. Differentially expressed genes were screened from the GEO dataset GSE7014, and ATP1B4 was identified as a candidate gene associated with DS. A DS rat model was established via high-fat diet feeding and streptozotocin injection. ATP1B4 expression was modulated through lentiviral overexpression or knockdown. Additionally, PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway activators (SC79, leucine) and inhibitors (LY294002, MK-2206) were administered. Protein expression of ATP1B4, phosphorylated PI3K/AKT/mTOR components, and autophagy markers (LC3-II, DRP1, ATG9, MFN2) was assessed via Western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence. Skeletal muscle function and structure were evaluated using behavioral tests (treadmill and inclined plane) and histopathological staining (H&E, Masson, PAS). Bioinformatic analysis of the GSE7014 dataset identified ATP1B4 as a skeletal muscle-related differentially expressed gene enriched in extracellular matrix and metabolic pathways. In DS rats, ATP1B4 expression was upregulated, coinciding with suppression of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling and activation of mitophagy markers (LC3-II, DRP1, ATG9). Overexpression of ATP1B4 exacerbated hyperglycemia, muscle atrophy, collagen accumulation, and glycogen deposition, while knockdown reversed these effects. Activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway improved muscle function and histological architecture, normalized autophagy, and reduced pathological features. However, co-overexpression of ATP1B4 eliminated the protective effects of pathway activation. Conversely, dual intervention with ATP1B4 knockdown and PI3K activation restored skeletal muscle integrity and autophagy flux. Importantly, ATP1B4 expression remained unchanged following pathway modulation, supporting its unidirectional upstream regulatory role in DS. ATP1B4 may aggravate diabetic sarcopenia by acting as an upstream suppressor of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway.",

The leucine-rich repeat-containing 8 (LRRC8) channel complex forms a lysosomal anion channel and regulates PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling, skeletal muscle differentiation, growth, and systemic glucose metabolism. Here, we define the endogenous LRRC8 subunits localized to a subset of lysosomes in differentiated myotubes. We show that LRRC8A affects leucine-stimulated mTOR; lysosome size; number; pH; expression of lysosomal proteins LAMP2, P62, and LC3B; and lysosomal function. Mutating an LRRC8A lysosomal targeting dileucine motif sequence (LRRC8A-L706A;L707A) in myotubes recapitulates the abnormal AKT signaling and altered lysosomal morphology and pH observed in LRRC8A knockout cells. In vivo, LRRC8A-L706A;L707A knock-in mice exhibit increased adiposity, impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance associated with reduced skeletal muscle PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling, glucose uptake, and impaired incorporation of glucose into glycogen. These data reveal a lysosomal LRRC8-mediated metabolic signaling function regulating lysosomal function, systemic glucose homeostasis, and insulin sensitivity.",

    "abstract": "Brown adipose tissue (BAT) comprises a heterogeneous population of adipocytes and non-adipocyte cell types. To characterize these cellular subpopulations and their adaptation to cold, we performed single-nucleus mRNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) on interscapular BAT from mice maintained at room temperature or exposed to acute (24h) or chronic (10 days) cold (6 °C). To investigate the role of the de novo lipogenesis (DNL)-regulating transcription factor carbohydrate response element-binding protein (ChREBP), we analyzed control and brown adipocyte-specific ChREBP knockout mice. We identified different cell populations, including seven brown adipocyte subtypes with distinct metabolic profiles. One of them highly expressed ChREBP and DNL enzymes. Notably, these lipogenic adipocytes were highly sensitive to acute cold exposure, showing a marked depletion in BAT of control mice that was compensated by other brown adipocyte subtypes maintaining DNL. Chronic cold exposure resulted in an expansion of basal brown adipocytes and adipocytes putatively derived from stromal and endothelial precursors. In ChREBP-deficient mice, lipogenic adipocytes were almost absent under all conditions, identifying the transcription factor as a key determinant of this adipocyte subtype. Detailed expression analyses revealed Ttc25 as a specific marker of lipogenic brown adipocytes and as a downstream target of ChREBP. Furthermore, pathway and cell-cell interaction analyses implicated a Wnt-ChREBP axis in the maintenance of lipogenic adipocytes, with Wnt ligands from stromal and muscle cells providing instructive cues. Our findings provide a comprehensive atlas of BAT cellular heterogeneity and reveal a critical role for ChREBP in lipogenic adipocyte identity, with implications for BAT plasticity and metabolic function.",

    "title": "Enhancing Muscle Quality: Exploring Leucine and Whey Protein in Sarcopenic Individuals.",
    "abstract": "Sarcopenia is characterised by a decline in the skeletal muscle mass with increasing age. This poses many challenges to the health and independence of older individuals. New and emerging studies have focused on supplementing leucine-enriched whey protein and resistance training in older adults to mitigate the effects of sarcopenia, including significant muscle mass loss. This study aimed to comprehensively analyse the current literature regarding the beneficial effects of leucine-enriched whey protein supplementation in older adults. This article systematically reviewed randomised controlled trials, longitudinal studies, and meta-analyses published between 2011 and 2024. The biochemical mechanisms underlying the anabolic properties of leucine, including its role in protein synthesis and mTOR signalling pathways, were explored to elucidate its potential to enhance muscle protein accretion. Findings from the reviewed studies indicate that the combined intervention of leucine-enriched whey protein supplementation and resistance training elicits favourable outcomes regarding increased lean muscle mass, muscle strength and physical performance in older adults with sarcopenia. The potential of leucine-enriched whey protein to mitigate muscle protein breakdown is discussed along with its potential synergistic effects with resistance exercise to optimise muscle adaptation. Future research directions, including investigations of optimal dosing regimens, long-term sustainability and potential contraindications, are proposed to enhance the precision and applicability of this intervention strategy. Leucine-enriched whey protein supplementation combined with resistance training is beneficial in addressing sarcopenia in older adults. This review consolidates the current understanding of this intervention, highlights its potential benefits and provides insights for future research and clinical applications in geriatric muscle health.",

    "abstract": "There is considerable variation in the anabolic action of ingesting protein-dense foods on the stimulation of postprandial myofibrillar protein synthesis rates (MPS) despite ingesting similar amounts of protein and essential amino acids (EAA). This study aims to determine the effects of consuming high-fat pork (HFP), low-fat pork (LFP), or a carbohydrate control (CHO) on the MPS response. In a semicrossover design, 16 physically active adults (25 ± 5 y; 25.0 ± 2.3 kg/m Both HFP and LFP conditions increased MPS above postabsorptive values (P = 0.028 and P < 0.001, respectively), with LFP eliciting a greater postexercise MPS {0.106 ± 0.026 %/h [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.088, 0.118]} than HFP [0.072 ± 0.027 %/h (95% CI: 0.057, 0.087); P = 0.030] and CHO [0.056 ± 0.035 %/h (95% CI: 0.41, 0.71); P < 0.001]. The absolute change in MPS from basal was significantly correlated with peak EAA and leucine concentrations (r = 0.4638, P = 0.017; r = 0.4211, P = 0.032). LFP stimulated MPS more than HFP or CHO conditions. Our work demonstrated that other nutrients in the food matrix, beyond total ingested protein or EAAs, can impact the regulation of MPS in healthy adults. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT05876299.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance are driven in part by dysregulated signaling through the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway. The scaffold protein JIP1 and its upstream kinase DLK (dual leucine zipper kinase) form a dynamic signaling complex that modulates JNK activity, yet the physiological role of DLK in glucose metabolism remains undefined. Here, we identify DLK as a critical regulator of insulin sensitivity using three genetically modified mouse models: a hypomorphic DLK allele, a tamoxifen-inducible whole-body DLK knockout, and a high-fat diet-induced obese model with DLK ablation. All models exhibited enhanced insulin sensitivity independent of adiposity, characterized by increased glucose uptake in muscle and adipose tissue, and improved suppression of hepatic glucose production during hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp studies. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that DLK functions in a cell-autonomous manner, limiting insulin signaling through modulation of AKT and IRS1 phosphorylation downstream of insulin stimulation. In cultured myoblasts and fibroblasts, DLK was required for JNK activation and subsequent dampening of insulin signaling. These findings establish DLK as a regulator of whole-body insulin sensitivity, independent of obesity through a JIP-JNK signaling module. The results suggest that targeting DLK could represent a therapeutic strategy for improving insulin sensitivity in metabolic disease.",

The patient presented with an infiltrative nasal cavity tumour. Histologic examination showed a tumour composed of sheets and nests of epithelioid cells with clear to eosinophilic granular cytoplasm, round to oval nuclei, inconspicuous nucleoli and no mitotic activity. The tumour cells featured strong diffuse expression of smooth muscle actin and nuclear TFE3, with patchy expression of HMB45. Neoplastic cells showed no immune-reactivity for Melan A. Molecular genetic analysis revealed a novel TRAF3(ex8)::TFE3(ex6) fusion.

    "abstract": "Running promotes skeletal muscle remodeling through metabolic and inflammatory signaling pathways, though the extent to which these responses are sex-dependent remains unclear. We profiled cytokine responses in quadriceps lysates from sedentary, voluntary wheel-running (VWR), and muscle-specific TFEB-overexpressing (cTFEB;HSACre) male and female mice. Cytokine analysis revealed 40 differentially expressed factors associated with exercise and/or TFEB overexpression, many exhibiting sex-dimorphic patterns. In males, VWR increased interleukins (IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-5, and IL-17) and chemokines (e.g., MCP-1, CCL5, and CXCL9), including components of TNF signaling (e.g., TNFα, sTNFR1/2, and Fas ligand). These elevations were partially recapitulated by TFEB overexpression in sedentary males. In contrast, female VWR muscle showed limited changes, with significant differences restricted to IL-3, IL-3Rb, IL-13, and CXCL16. These findings demonstrate sex-specific cytokine responses to endurance-like stimuli and suggest a broader or more prolonged inflammatory remodeling profile in male skeletal muscle. Moreover, muscle-specific TFEB overexpression reproduced similar endurance-induced cytokine changes, particularly in males, highlighting TFEB as a partial molecular mimic of exercise-associated inflammatory signaling in skeletal muscle. Together, our data underscore the importance of sex as a biological variable in exercise-induced cytokine remodeling and support the utility of TFEB overexpression as a platform for prioritizing exercise-associated phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is a complex chronic disease requiring lifelong comprehensive treatment. In addition to lifestyle counseling that improves nutrition and physical activity, a promising new generation of obesity medications has been added to bariatric procedures as therapeutic options to achieve weight reduction and improve health outcomes. With the promise of effective and safe treatments comes the need to emphasize maximal reduction of body fat and minimal loss of vital body components, including skeletal muscle and bone. Nutrition is a critical aspect of obesity care and is leveraged to support preservation of lean tissues, such as skeletal muscle, through adequate, daily, high-quality protein intake and intake of key micronutrients. More targeted nutrition approaches that promote muscle protein synthesis include amino acid supplementation with leucine and its metabolite β-hydroxy β-methylbutyrate. Another potential target for support is the gut microbiome, as its adequate function is increasingly seen as playing a role in human health and metabolism. Obesity is a heterogenous disease, and there is considerable interest in specific metabolic phenotypes that might be used to tailor nutrition strategies. As research advances on these and other fronts, there is the potential to identify precision nutrition strategies for individualized, more effective approaches to lifelong obesity management.",

    "title": "Alpha-Ketoisocaproate Attenuates Muscle Atrophy in Cancer Cachexia Models.",
    "abstract": "Cancer-associated cachexia (CAC) is a multifactorial syndrome characterised by progressive loss of muscle mass with limited Food and Drug Administration treatments. Although emerging evidence suggests that l-leucine and β-hydroxy-β-methyl butyrate (HMB) have potential for treating CAC, the role of α-ketoisocaproate (KIC), a metabolite of l-leucine, remains unclear. Therefore, this study explored the use of KIC as a therapeutic agent for CAC-induced muscle atrophy by targeting myostatin. We evaluated the effect of KIC on muscle atrophy using BALB/c mice and C2C12 myotubes as models of C26- and 4T1-induced CAC. Male and female mice were injected with C26 and 4T1 cells, respectively. Grip strength was measured weekly, and mice were sacrificed 4 weeks post-injection for muscle collection. C2C12 myotubes were treated with conditioned media (CM) derived from C26 or 4T1 cells. KIC suppressed mRNA expression of myostatin, a key regulator of muscle atrophy, more effectively than did l-leucine (-26.37 ± 4.11%, p < 0.01). KIC enhanced protein turnover in C2C12 myotubes and maintained 50% cell viability at high concentrations (KIC: 4.68 mM, HMB: 3.11 mM). Following CM treatment, KIC suppressed MuRF1 and MAFbx expression in a myostatin-dependent manner, thereby reducing their polyubiquitination. KIC restored Akt-FoxO3a phosphorylation, leading to improved myotube diameter (+63.8 ± 25.71%, p < 0.05) and fusion index (+51.9 ± 22.6%, p < 0.05). Immunofluorescence and nuclear fractionation revealed that KIC reduced FoxO3a nuclear accumulation. CM reduced p-Akt-FoxO3a interaction, which was rescued by KIC. In vivo, KIC administration increased body weight (11.11 ± 8.53%), grip strength (24.76 ± 10.58%), and skeletal muscle mass (p < 0.001) in C26 tumour-bearing mice. Protein expression of myostatin in the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle (-23.57 ± 12.22%, p < 0.05) and serum (-52.11 ± 3.56%, p < 0.001) was lower in KIC-treated mice (n = 12) compared with that in the controls. KIC increased the mean fibre cross-sectional area in TA (24.51 ± 14.14%, p < 0.01). In 4T1 tumour-bearing mice, KIC improved body weight (13.10 ± 10.76%) and grip strength (7.42 ± 4.33%) (p < 0.001, n = 10). Serum myostatin levels (-57.43 ± 9.46%, p < 0.001) and skeletal muscle weight were reduced in KIC-treated mice (n = 10). Our findings demonstrate that KIC improves muscle function in CAC-induced muscle atrophy by regulating myostatin expression in skeletal muscle via the Akt-FoxO3a pathway. Thus, KIC has been proposed as a potential therapeutic agent against CAC.",

    "abstract": "Plant-based protein supplementation in supporting muscle recovery following resistance exercise remains an area of growing interest, particularly among vegan athletes, as a potential alternative to animal-based proteins. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of plant-based proteins on recovery from resistance exercise-induced muscle damage in healthy young adults. A systematic and comprehensive search was administered in eight databases up to 1 May 2025, identifying 1407 articles. Following deduplication and screening, 24 studies met the eligibility criteria, including 22 randomized controlled trials and 2 non-randomized studies, with the majority from high income western countries. Interventions primarily involved soy, pea, rice, hemp, potato, and blended plant protein sources, with doses ranging from 15 to 50 g, typically administered post resistance exercise. Outcomes assessed included muscle protein synthesis (MPS), delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS), inflammatory biomarkers, muscle function, and fatigue. The review findings reaffirm that single-source plant proteins generally offer limited benefits compared to animal proteins such as whey, particularly in acute recovery settings, a limitation well-documented consistently in the literature. However, our synthesis highlights that well-formulated plant protein blends (e.g., combinations of pea, rice, and canola) can stimulate MPS at levels comparable to whey when consumed at adequate doses (≥30 g with ~2.5 g leucine). Some studies also reported improvements in subjective recovery outcomes and reductions in muscle damage biomarkers with soy or pea protein. However, overall evidence remains limited by small sample sizes, moderate to high risk of bias, and heterogeneity in intervention protocols, protein formulations, and outcome measures. Risk of bias assessments revealed concerns related to detection and reporting bias in nearly half the studies. Due to clinical and methodological variability, a meta-analysis was not conducted. plant-based proteins particularly in the form of protein blends and when dosed appropriately, may support muscle recovery in resistance-trained individuals and offer a viable alternative to animal-based proteins. However, further high-quality, long-term trials in vegan populations are needed to establish definitive recommendations for plant protein use in sports nutrition.",

This prospective observational study followed two cohorts of malnourished patients receiving personalized nutritional interventions over 3 months. One group received a leucine-enriched oral supplement (20 % protein, 100 % whey, 3 g leucine), while other received a standard supplement (hypercaloric and normo-hyperproteic) with mixed protein sources. Nutritional status was assessed at baseline and after 3 months using anthropometry, bioelectrical impedance analysis, AI assisted muscle ultrasound, and handgrip strength. A total of 142 patients were included (76 Leucine-ONS, 66 Standard-ONS), mostly women (65.5 %), mean age 62.00 (18.66) years. Malnutrition was present in 90.1 % and 34.5 % had sarcopenia. Cancer was the most common condition (30.3 %). The Leucine-ONS group showed greater improvements in phase angle (+2.08 % vs. -1.57 %; p = 0.02) and rectus femoris thickness (+1.72 % vs. -5.89 %; p = 0.03). Multivariate analysis confirmed associations between Leucine-ONS and improved phase angle (OR = 2.41; 95%CI: 1.18-4.92; p = 0.02) and reduced intramuscular fat (OR = 2.24; 95%CI: 1.13-4.46; p = 0.02). Leucine-enriched-ONS significantly improved phase angle and muscle thickness compared to standard ONS, supporting its role in enhancing body composition in malnourished patients. These results must be interpreted in the context of the observational design of the study, the heterogeneity of comparison groups and the short duration of intervention. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these results and assess long-term clinical and functional outcomes.",

    "title": "Binding of Hypoxia-Induced Mitogenic Factor/RELM-β to Bone Morphogenetic Protein Receptor 2 Complex Promotes Pulmonary Hypertension.",
    "abstract": "HIMF (hypoxia-induced mitogenic factor) induces pulmonary hypertension; however, the molecular nature of its extracellular membrane receptor(s) remains unknown. A combination of cross-immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting, yeast 2-hybrid assays, and proteomics analysis was performed to screen and identify the candidate receptors. The interaction of HIMF with these candidate(s) was further evaluated using overexpression, silencing, point mutation, and blocking peptide strategies in chronic hypoxia and sugen/hypoxia pulmonary hypertension rat models to decipher the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms. Cross-immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting identified HIMF interaction with the BMPR2 (bone morphogenetic protein receptor 2) complex. Yeast 2-hybrid revealed HIMF binding to the DTLPF motif (Asp-Thr-leucine-Pro-Phe [aspartic acid-threonine-leucine-proline-phenylalanine]) at the 54 to 58 amino acids (aa) in the extracellular domain of the BMPR1A (bone morphogenetic protein receptor 1A), one partner of the BMPR2 heterodimeric complex, but not BMPR2 itself. HIMF and human counterpart RELM (resistin-like molecule)-β binding to BMPR1A disrupted the BMPR1A/BMPR2 complex and decreased BMPR2 activity as revealed by reduced downstream events including ≈43% to 56% decline in Smad1/5/9 (Sma- and Mad-related protein 1/5/9) phosphorylation and ≈41% to 60% decrease in Id-1 (inhibitor of DNA binding 1) expression. This dynamic induced pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell proliferation and pulmonary vascular remodeling leading to pulmonary hypertension. A mutated motif in rats or a blocking peptide targeting this motif restrained HIMF binding with BMPR1A, rescued BMPR2 activity by ≈25% increase in Smad/1/5/9 phosphorylation and ≈39% elevation in Id-1 expression, and attenuated chronic hypoxia or sugen/hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension. HIMF induced pulmonary hypertension by direct binding to BMPR1A ectodomain, subsequently disrupting its binding to BMPR2 and BMPR2 activity. This HIMF signaling pathway represents a potential therapeutic target by selectively interfering with BMPR1A binding.",

    "abstract": "Essential tremor (ET) is a common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by action tremors and various non-motor symptoms. This study investigated the potential therapeutic effects of ketamine, an NMDA receptor antagonist with known GABA modulatory and anti-inflammatory properties, in a harmaline-induced model of ET in mice. We also evaluated the changes in expression of inflammatory interleukin 6 (IL-6) as well as Leucine rich repeat and Immunoglobin-like domain-containing protein 1 (Lingo-1), a prominent gene involved in the pathogenesis of ET. Male Swiss Webster mice were divided into four groups: control, harmaline (10 mg/kg), ketamine (8 mg/kg), and harmaline + ketamine. Tremor severity, muscle strength, locomotor activity, anxiety-like behavior, and passive avoidance learning were assessed. Cerebellar expression of Lingo-1 and IL-6 was analyzed using real-time PCR. Ketamine did not significantly reduce harmaline-induced tremors but improved muscle strength deficits in the wire grip test. In the open field test, ketamine normalized some harmaline-induced changes in locomotor activity and grooming behavior. No significant differences were observed in passive avoidance learning across groups. At the molecular level, ketamine did not mitigate the harmaline-induced increase in IL-6 expression, and Lingo-1 expression was not significantly altered by either harmaline or ketamine treatment. Our findings suggest that ketamine has limited efficacy in the harmaline ET model, showing some improvements in motor function and anxiety-like behavior but failing to address core tremor symptoms or modulate inflammatory and Lingo-1 pathways. These results highlight the complex nature of ET pathophysiology and the need for further research into targeted therapeutic approaches.",

In this study, the effect of probiotics on the formation of leucine derivatives in yoghurts was investigated. Moreover, the addition of leucine, whey protein, and lactose, protease treatment, and various fermentation conditions were evaluated to enhance the synthesis of these compounds by yoghurt and kefir starter cultures. Lactobacillus rhamnosus was the most effective probiotic for 2-hydroxyisocaproic acid formation in yoghurt. In fermented milk product with yoghurt starter culture, pH adjustment (pH 6), the addition of leucine (1 %) and whey protein (20 %) to the milk, and extended fermentation time (21h) increased the 2-hydroxyisocaproic acid concentration to 4651 mg/kg dry weight. This study provides insights into the impact of fermentation on leucine derivatives, offering valuable knowledge for the development of new food products by optimizing fermentation conditions.",

    "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is rising in prevalence and incidence, which is leading to increased burden on healthcare systems. A less recognized consequence of T2DM is the accelerated loss of skeletal muscle, which can reduce quality of life and further exacerbate T2DM progression. Insulin resistance disrupts skeletal muscle maintenance by impairing insulin- and leucine-mediated signalling-processes challenging to study due to the number and complexity of dysregulated components. Several key areas in this field remain underexplored, such as the causal relationship between T2DM and muscle atrophy, the impact of insulin resistance on muscle protein balance, and the mechanisms driving muscle atrophy in humans with T2DM. Advancing understanding in these areas requires the integration of evidence from experimental, prospective, and computational studies to more precisely characterize the mechanisms and progression of T2DM-related muscle atrophy and to inform targeted interventions to mitigate muscle loss.",

    "title": "Understanding Dietary Protein Quality: Digestible Indispensable Amino Acid Scores and Beyond.",
    "abstract": "Dietary protein quality refers to the capacity of a food to meet the human metabolic needs for essential amino acids (EAAs) and nitrogen. This is critical in low- and middle-income countries, where severe protein malnutrition occurs, and relevant in higher-income countries, where increasing dietary EAA intake may improve health and function. There are several methods to assess protein quality, each with different objectives. Chemical scoring metrics, like the digestible indispensable amino acid score, describe the EAA composition and digestibility of a protein source. However, these methods do not capture the metabolic activity of food-derived amino acids. Overreliance on a single metric leads to generic dietary recommendations lacking individual context. This review draws on chemical score and stable isotope methods to provide a comprehensive assessment of dietary protein quality. We translate these findings into practical recommendations for improving protein quality in the context of whole diets. High-quality protein sources are characterized by high EAA density (%EAAs/kcals), digestibility, bioavailability, and the capacity to stimulate protein synthesis. Practically, protein quality improves when using processing and cooking methods that reduce antinutrients, denature proteins, and reduce food particle size and structure. Conversely, protein quality decreases when exposing foods to prolonged storage, heat sterilization, and high surface temperatures. Diet modeling studies show that EAA density and protein quality are higher in omnivorous and lacto-ovo-vegetarian diets, and diets high in whole food plant-derived proteins may require greater total protein and energy intakes to compensate for lower protein quality. For incomplete plant-derived proteins, consuming complementary proteins may be beneficial. Considerations for dietary protein quality in older adults include chewing efficiency, food particle size, and higher EAA density and leucine intakes to maximize muscle protein synthesis. Recognizing dietary protein quality as a multifaceted, modifiable metric is essential to improving dietary recommendations and public health outcomes.",

    "abstract": "While maternal proline (Pro) supplementation has demonstrated efficacy in enhancing placental angiogenesis and farrowing efficiency in swine, its regulatory role in fetal skeletal muscle ontogeny remains undefined. This study systematically evaluated the temporal-specific impacts of dietary Pro supplementation during critical phases of fetal myogenesis (encompassing primary myofiber formation and secondary myofiber hyperplasia) on offspring muscle development. A total of 120 sows with similar farrowing schedules were assigned to three groups: CON (basal diet), ST-Pro (0.5% Pro supplementation during secondary myofiber formation period, from d 60 gestation to farrowing), LT-Pro (0.5% Pro supplementation spanning primary and secondary myofiber formation period: from d 20 gestation to farrowing). LT-Pro group significantly increased the longissimus dorsi (LD) muscle mass per unit body weight in newborn piglets compared to CON group (P < 0.05), while no such effect was observed in the ST-Pro group. Metabolomic profiling revealed elevated Pro, lysine, and tryptophan levels in the LD muscle of LT-Pro group piglets, accompanied by reduced branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs; leucine, isoleucine, and valine) in both serum and muscle (P < 0.05). Histological analysis demonstrated a 45.74% increase in myofiber cross-sectional area in the LT-Pro group (P < 0.05). At the molecular level, LT-Pro group piglets exhibited upregulated mRNA expression levels of myogenic regulatory genes (MYOD1, MYF6) and the cell cycle accelerator CCND1 (P < 0.05), coupled with activation of the STAT3 signaling pathway (phosphorylated STAT3 protein increased by 2.53-fold, P < 0.01). Furthermore, Pro supplementation enhanced oxidative metabolism, evidenced by elevated mitochondrial biogenesis markers (the mRNA expression levels of PPARGC1A, OPA1, and SQSTM1) and a 61.58% increase in succinate dehydrogenase activity (P < 0.05). Notably, LT-Pro group piglets showed a selective shift toward slow-twitch oxidative fibers, with both MyHC1 mRNA and protein expression levels significantly upregulated (P < 0.05), while the mRNA expression levels of MyHCIIb showed no significant change. This study identified the primary fiber formation period as a critical window. Supplementation with Pro during G20-114 reprogrammed offspring skeletal muscle development through STAT3-CCND1-mediated myoblast proliferation, enhanced mitochondrial bioenergetics, and oxidative fiber specification. However, no such effects were observed during G60-114. These findings propose maternal Pro intervention as a novel strategy to enhance muscle yield and metabolic efficiency in swine production, with potential applications for improving meat quality traits linked to oxidative muscle phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "As the global population ages, the risks associated with primary sarcopenia, including falls, fractures, functional decline, and frailty, are becoming increasingly apparent, all of which significantly impair the quality of life in older adults. Emerging evidence suggests that the gut microbiota plays a pivotal role in maintaining muscle physiology. Specific gut bacteria promote intramuscular protein synthesis through the production of certain amino acids (e.g., leucine, tryptophan), short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and hydrogen sulfide. Notably, Escherichia coli expressing the enzyme nicotinamidase (PncA) has been shown to enhance nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) synthesis, potentially improving mitochondrial function in muscle tissue. Furthermore, secondary bile acids and lactate influence the levels of fibroblast growth factor 15/19 and unacylated ghrelin in circulation by binding to receptors that are highly expressed in gut endocrine cells, thereby affecting muscle physiology. This review examines the characteristic composition of the gut microbiota in patients with sarcopenia, its role in primary sarcopenia, and potential therapeutic targets.",

    "title": "Inactivity-induced NR4A3 downregulation in human skeletal muscle affects glucose metabolism and translation: Insights from in vitro analysis.",
    "abstract": "Physical activity promotes health, whereas inactivity is associated with metabolic impairment. The transcription factor nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group A member 3 (NR4A3) is a pleiotropic regulator of skeletal muscle exercise adaptation and metabolism. However, the consequence of lower NR4A3 expression remains largely unexplored. We investigated the impact of NR4A3 downregulation on human skeletal muscle metabolism. Published transcriptomic datasets from human bed rest and limb immobilisation studies were curated to meta-analyse the effect of physical inactivity on skeletal muscle NR4A3 levels. In primary human skeletal myotubes, siRNA and lentivirus were used to silence and overexpress NR4A3, respectively. Basal and stimulated (insulin ± leucine) signal transduction was determined by immunoblot analysis. Effects on glucose, fatty acid, and protein metabolism were measured using radiolabelled substrate assays. Lactate production was assessed in culture supernatant by colourimetry. Cell morphology was analysed by immunocytochemistry and gene expression was quantified by RT-qPCR. Physical inactivity decreased skeletal muscle NR4A3 (-27%), concomitant with pathways related to mitochondrial function, cytoskeleton organization, chromatin regulation, protein synthesis and degradation. Silencing of NR4A3 reduced glucose oxidation (-18%) and increased lactate production (+23%) in vitro. This coincided with greater signalling downstream of AMPK and elevated rates of basal (+26%) and FCCP-stimulated (+55%) fatty acid oxidation. NR4A3 downregulation lowered protein synthesis (-25%), and impaired mTORC1 signalling and ribosomal transcription. Alternatively, overexpression of the canonical NR4A3 protein isoform (+290%) augmented translation and total cellular protein content, which protected myotubes against dexamethasone-induced atrophy. Moreover, partial restoration of NR4A3 levels rescued glucose oxidation in NR4A3-silenced muscle cells and restored phosphorylation of mTORC1 substrates. NR4A3 depletion reduced myotube area (-48%) and further altered protein and gene expression of key contractile elements in skeletal muscle. Our study connects reduced NR4A3 expression with physical inactivity and indicates that NR4A3 downregulation in human skeletal muscle has adverse effects on glucose metabolism and protein synthesis. Thus, decrements in NR4A3 abundance could be causal in the deleterious health consequences resulting from sedentary lifestyles and targeting NR4A3 may offer new avenues for combating conditions such as disuse muscle atrophy.",

    "title": "Therapeutic advances in sarcopenia management: From traditional interventions to personalized medicine.",
    "abstract": "Sarcopenia, a progressive decline in skeletal muscle mass and function, has emerged as a critical geriatric syndrome affecting 10-40% of older adults, contributing to increased disability and mortality. This comprehensive review evaluates evidence-based strategies for sarcopenia management, from established interventions to emerging personalized approaches. Pathophysiological insights reveal multifactorial mechanisms involving anabolic resistance, chronic inflammation (elevated IL-6, TNF-α), hormonal imbalances (e.g., testosterone/IGF-1 decline), neuromuscular junction dysfunction, mitochondrial impairment, and novel mediators like GDF-15, which drive proteolysis and appetite suppression. Non-pharmacological interventions demonstrate robust efficacy: combined resistance-aerobic exercise regimens (2-3 sessions/week) improve muscle strength by 20-35%, while optimized protein intake (1.0-1.5 g/kg/day) with leucine or vitamin D supplementation enhances muscle synthesis and functional capacity. Pharmacological trials highlight selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs) and myostatin inhibitors (e.g., bimagrumab) increasing lean mass by 3-5% in phase II studies, with GDF-15-neutralizing antibodies emerging as promising anti-catabolic agents. Advanced therapies, including stem cell transplantation and AAV-mediated gene editing targeting myostatin/IGF-1 pathways, show preclinical regenerative potential. However, clinical translation requires validation through large-scale trials. Personalized strategies integrating biomarkers, comorbidities, and digital monitoring tools optimize intervention efficacy, particularly in complex populations like diabetic or cachectic patients. This synthesis underscores the paradigm shift toward precision medicine but identifies critical knowledge gaps, including long-term safety of biologics and cost-effectiveness of regenerative approaches. Future research should prioritize multimodal therapies, validated biomarkers, and AI-driven algorithms to individualize sarcopenia management in aging populations.",

    "title": "Sarcopenia in cirrhosis: a clinical practice review.",
    "abstract": "Cirrhosis, a leading cause of death in the United States, is a result of chronic liver injury leading to progressive liver fibrosis. Initially asymptomatic, cirrhosis progresses to decompensated forms characterized by jaundice, ascites, gastroesophageal variceal bleeding, and hepatic encephalopathy (HE). Malnutrition, frailty, and sarcopenia are prevalent comorbidities in cirrhosis patients and are often used interchangeably in the clinical setting. Malnutrition is a condition marked by imbalanced nutrient intake and is closely related to the development of frailty and sarcopenia. Frailty is characterized by the decline in physiological reserve and function, while sarcopenia is the generalized loss of skeletal mass. Both are insidious complications of cirrhosis and also significantly influence morbidity, mortality, and transplant outcomes. Major contributing factors include decreased oral intake, poor nutrient uptake and deranged metabolism. Accurate assessment of frailty and sarcopenia in patients with cirrhosis is essential for predicting clinical outcomes. Interventions targeting frailty and sarcopenia could significantly improve patient prognosis. Nutritional interventions and physical activity promote muscle protein synthesis, increase muscle mass and mitigate sarcopenia. A cirrhosis-specific treatment includes ammonia-lowering agents to improve cognitive function and ultimately oral intake, and increase muscle mass. Emerging therapies, such as including L-ornithine L-aspartate, leucine-enriched branch-chained amino acids, hold promise in modulating skeletal muscle. This review explores the definitions, clinical manifestations, and consequences of malnutrition, frailty, and sarcopenia in cirrhosis, emphasizing the importance of early assessment and intervention.",

    "abstract": "Protein variants of the same gene─proteoforms─can have high molecular similarity yet exhibit different biological functions. Thus, the identification of unique peptides that unambiguously map to proteoforms can provide crucial biological insights. In humans, four human tropomyosin (TPM) genes produce similar proteoforms that can be challenging to distinguish with standard proteomics tools. For example, TPM1 and TPM2 share 85% sequence identity with amino acid substitutions that play unique roles in muscle contraction and myopathies. In this study, we evaluated the ability of the recently released Platinum single-molecule protein sequencer to detect proteoform-informative peptides. Platinum employs fluorophore-labeled recognizers that reversibly bind to cognate N-terminal amino acids (NAAs), enabling polypeptide sequencing within nanoscale apertures of a semiconductor chip that can accommodate single peptide molecules. As a proof of concept, we evaluated the ability of Platinum to distinguish three main types of proteoform variation: paralogue-level, transcript-level, and post-translational modification (PTM). We distinguished paralogous TPM1 and TPM2 peptides differing in a single isobaric residue (leucine/isoleucine). We also distinguished tissue-specific TPM2 spliceforms. Notably, we found that a phosphotyrosine-modified peptide displayed a reduced recognizer affinity for tyrosine, showing sensitivity to PTMs. This study paves the way for the targeted detection of proteoform biomarkers at the single molecule level.",

    "abstract": "A healthy life depends on the availability and the synthesis of amino acids as they are building blocks of proteins and regulators of principal physiological processes in organisms. Contemporary investigations have elucidated amino acids' roles in biological processes, emphasizing their contributions to preventing and treating metabolic disorders. Their structural architecture and nutritional importance elucidate their diverse biological roles, including muscle protein synthesis, immune support, neurological functions, and energy metabolism. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), a prevalent metabolic disorder marked by insulin resistance and hyperglycemia, exemplifies a pertinent case for examining the relevance of amino acids in pathological conditions. The alteration of the amino acid profile, particularly high levels of leucine, isoleucine, and valine, is connected with insulin resistance and oxidative stress, which contribute to the progression of T2DM. In contrast, the potential therapeutic benefit of branched chain amino acid (BCAA) has earlier been reported to influence insulin signaling pathways, promote glucose uptake, and decrease inflammatory responses. However, the dosage and combination of amino acid intake through dietary interventions and supplementation may offer promising benefits to improve the management of T2DM effectively. This review investigates the functions of amino acids in normal physiological states, their potential as a diagnostic biomarker, the probable risk of deficiency, and the therapeutic ability for managing and preventing T2DM. Conversely, there is a need to intensively investigate the controversial dual role of BCAA in T2DM, the mechanism of amino acid actions in insulin resistance, the effect of a combination of amino acids, and the dosage limit in diabetic conditions.",

    "title": "Nutrition support whilst on glucagon-like peptide-1 based therapy. Is it necessary?",
    "abstract": "Weight loss is a primary goal in the treatment of obesity, but its effect on body composition - particularly fat-free mass (FFM) and skeletal muscle mass (SM) - is of increasing concern. This review examines the effects of antiobesity medications, particularly glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor analogs (GLP-1 RA), on body composition, the risk of sarcopenia, and strategies to preserve muscle mass during pharmacological weight loss. Studies have shown that while GLP-1 RA are effective in reducing fat mass, up to 40% of the total weight loss can come from FFM. However, it is important to distinguish between FFM and SM, as FFM includes nonmuscle components. Resistance training and adequate protein intake can mitigate muscle loss, but the evidence for their efficacy in the context of GLP-1 RA therapy is mixed. If these measures are insufficient to prevent and maintain muscle mass, the use of some nutrients, such as branched chain amino acids, creatine, leucine, omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin D, may be beneficial. Newer pharmacological approaches, such as bimagrumab, a human monoclonal antibody that acts by binding to the activin type II receptor II (ActRII), and other activin or myostatin inhibitors, show promise in preserving muscle mass while promoting fat loss. GLP-1 RA therapy for obesity should include resistance training, optimal protein intake and, if needed, specific nutrients and possibly pharmacological interventions to preserve muscle mass. Further research is needed to assess the long-term effects of GLP-1 RA on muscle health and to refine strategies to prevent sarcopenia in patients undergoing pharmacological weight loss.",

    "abstract": "The monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) 8 is a specific transporter for thyroid hormones. Pathogenic variants in MCT8 lead to a severe psychomotor disorder called MCT8 deficiency. A recently published patient carries a MCT8V235 to leucine substitution that was incapable of T3 transport. Analyses of our MCT8 homology model predicted steric clashes between Leu235 and Phe285 as well as Gln288, possibly affecting another transport-sensitive phenylalanine at position 287. We analyzed the occurrence of potential van der Waals (VDW) interactions between Leu235 and Phe285 as well as Gln288 in the homology model. We overexpressed MCT8V235 and MCT8F287 mutants with altered side-chain properties in cells to assess their role in T3 transport function. In addition, we created an MCT8V235L,F285A double mutant. Mutations of MCT8V235 to alanine, threonine or isoleucine, as well as the analysis of potential VDW interactions, helped us to identify Phe285, but not Gln288, as the amino acid responsible for the inactivity of MCT8V235L. The hypothesis was supported by activity measurements of an MCT8V235L,F285A double mutant that showed rescued T3 transport with KM values similar to wild-type MCT8. The analyses of MCT8F287 mutated to tyrosine, tryptophan and valine revealed that the size and/or the aromatic properties of the amino acid side chain are crucial for proper membrane expression and T3 transport. We were able to restore transport activity of MCT8V235L by introducing a second mutation (MCT8V235L,F285A). We speculate that the additional mutation prevents a shift of Phe287 into the potential transport cavity, eventually restoring T3 transport.",

    "abstract": "Leucine, a branched-chain amino acid (BCAA), is an effective nutritional strategy to enhance skeletal muscle mass in aging populations. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of oral leucine-enriched BCAA supplementation on muscle mass, muscle synthesis biomarkers, and physical performance in elderly patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). A randomized controlled trial was conducted among CKD patients aged over 65 years. The participants were randomly assigned to receive either oral mixed BCAA supplementation (60% leucine, 4.5 g/day; 20% valine, 1.5 g/day; 20% isoleucine, 1.5 g/day) (N = 29) or a placebo (N = 26) for 12 weeks. Muscle mass, serum insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), and myostatin levels were measured at baseline and after 12 weeks. A 3-day food record was reviewed by a dietitian, and functional capacity was assessed using handgrip and 6-min walk tests. Fifty-five patients (mean age 75.4 ± 5.2 years) were enrolled. Daily protein and calorie intake were comparable between groups. At study conclusion, lean muscle mass significantly increased in the leucine group compared to placebo (0.4 kg [95% CI 0.1-0.7] vs. - 0.2 kg [95% CI - 0.6-0.2], P = 0.010). A significant difference in the percentage change in muscle mass was also observed (1.0 ± 1.8% vs. - 0.5 ± 2.6%, P = 0.014). No significant differences were found in muscle strength, serum myostatin, IGF-1, or adverse events. Leucine-enriched BCAA supplementation for 12 weeks significantly increased muscle mass but did not impact biomarkers of muscle activity or functional capacity in elderly CKD patients.

    "abstract": "This study investigated the effects of 0.4 % Leucine (Leu) addition on growth performance, intestinal growth, carcass characteristics, and pattern recognition receptors (PRR) gene expression in broilers. A Total of 144 one-day-old Arbor Acres broilers were randomly divided into two treatment groups: the basal diet (CON) and the basal diet added with 0.4 % crystalline Leu. Growth performance, visceral organ indices, carcass traits, intestinal growth, and mRNA levels of TLR2, TLR4, NOD1, NOD5, and IL-4 were analyzed at 20 and 40 d. Results indicated that Leu reduced the FCR during 1-20 d (P < 0.05) and increased ADG during 21-40 d (P < 0.05). Leu increased IL-4 expression in the duodenum and jejunum and enhanced relative intestinal weight and length during the starting phase (20 d) (P < 0.05). Leu downregulated the gene expression of NOD1, NOD5, and TLR4 in the duodenum (P < 0.05) and reduced the jejunal mRNA levels of NOD1 (P < 0.05). At 40 d, Leu increased pectoral muscle yield and downregulated TLR4 in pectoral muscle (P < 0.05). These findings suggest that dietary Leu supplementation improves intestinal development and modulates PRR-related immune responses in a tissue-specific manner, highlighting its potential as an immunomodulatory feed additive.",

Only valine supplementation resulted in a significant decrease in sperm concentration and viability. In addition, only valine supplementation was associated with a dramatic increase in sperm immotility.

Nutritional strategies, including protein intake, play a crucial role in cardiovascular rehabilitation by supporting overall health and recovery. This review explores the hypothesis that protein supplementation enhances muscle mass, leading to improved body composition and functional capacity in CVD patients. We conducted a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in accordance with the Cochrane Manual for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, with the protocol registered under CRD42022292687. A comprehensive search strategy, incorporating population, intervention, and study design terms, was executed across PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and Web of Science from data inception to February 1, 2024. Study quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool (RoB 2.0), and meta-analysis was performed with statistical packages in Rstudio 3.6.2. From 10 939 initial citations, seven RCTs and three pilot RCTs met the eligibility criteria. Sample sizes ranged from 11 to 70 participants, with mean ages between 55 and 80 years. The narrative synthesis revealed mixed effects of protein supplementation on body composition and functional capacity. Lean body mass improvements were observed in several trials, particularly when protein intake was combined with resistance training. However, reductions in adipose tissue were inconsistent.

    "abstract": "The phenotypic transition of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) is a central pathological alteration in pulmonary artery remodeling, contributing to pulmonary hypertension. Super-enhancers (SEs), characterized by histone modifications and the binding of coactivators, drive the expression of prominent genes that define cellular identity. However, the specific role of SEs, particularly SE-driven lncRNAs (long noncoding RNAs), in hypoxia-induced phenotypic plasticity of PASMCs remains unclear. In this study, the lncRNA UNC5B antisense RNA 1 (UNC5B-AS1) regulated by SEs was screened in hypoxic PASMCs using RNA sequencing and H3K27ac (histone 3 lysine 27 acetylation) ChIP (chromatin immunoprecipitation) sequencing. Overexpression or knockdown of UNC5B-AS1 in vitro was performed to elucidate its role in pulmonary hypertension pathogenesis. A serotype 5 adenovirus-associated virus carrying a conserved functional fragment of UNC5B-AS1 was used to treat pulmonary hypertension in vivo. We identified UNC5B-AS1 as an SE-driven lncRNA transcriptionally activated by the transcription factor FOXP3 (forkhead box protein P3), which regulates phenotypic transition in PASMCs. Notably, we demonstrated that UNC5B-AS1 interacts with key glycolytic enzymes in the cytoplasm and likely serves as a molecular scaffold for LRPPRC (leucine-rich PPR motif-containing protein) and oxidative respiratory chain complex IV in mitochondria. Consequently, the deficiency of UNC5B-AS1 in PASMCs promotes the lactylation of promoter regions within inflammatory genes, including those of IL (interleukin)-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α (tumor necrosis factor-α), under hypoxic conditions, ultimately leading to inflammatory phenotypic transition of PASMCs. Our findings identify SE-driven UNC5B-AS1 as a novel regulatory factor in the hypoxia-induced phenotypic transition of PASMCs and suggest that overexpression of UNC5B-AS1 may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for pulmonary hypertension.",

    "title": "Impact of resistance training on body composition and metabolic syndrome variables during androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer: a pilot randomized controlled trial.",
    "abstract": "Prostate cancer patients on androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) experience adverse effects such as lean mass loss, known as sarcopenia, fat gain, and changes in cardiometabolic factors that increase risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS). Resistance training can increase lean mass, reduce body fat, and improve physical function and quality of life, but no exercise interventions in prostate cancer patients on ADT have concomitantly improved body composition and MetS. This pilot trial investigated 12 weeks of resistance training on body composition and MetS changes in prostate cancer patients on ADT. An exploratory aim examined if a combined approach of training and protein supplementation would elicit greater changes in body composition. Prostate cancer patients on ADT were randomized to resistance training and protein supplementation (TRAINPRO), resistance training (TRAIN), protein supplementation (PRO), or control stretching (STRETCH). Exercise groups (EXE = TRAINPRO, TRAIN) performed supervised exercise 3 days per week for 12 weeks, while non-exercise groups (NoEXE = PRO, STRETCH) performed a home-based stretching program. TRAINPRO and PRO received 50 g⋅day A total of 37 participants were randomized; 32 participated in the intervention (EXE n = 13; NoEXE n = 19). At baseline, 43.8% of participants were sarcopenic and 40.6% met the criteria for MetS. Post-intervention, EXE significantly improved lean mass (d = 0.9), sarcopenia prevalence (d = 0.8), body fat % (d = 1.1), strength (d = 0.8-3.0), and prostate cancer-specific quality of life (d = 0.9) compared to NoEXE (p < 0.05). No significant differences were observed between groups for physical function or MetS-related variables except waist circumference (d = 0.8). A 12-week resistance training intervention effectively improved sarcopenia, body fat %, strength and quality of life in hypogonadal prostate cancer patients, but did not change MetS or physical function. PRO did not offer additional benefit in improving body composition. ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01909440 . Registered 24 July 2013.",

    "abstract": "The response to resistance training and protein supplementation in the latissimus dorsi muscle (LDM) has never been investigated. We investigated the effects of resistance training (RT) and protein supplementation on muscle mass, strength, and fiber characteristics of the LDM. Eighteen healthy young subjects were randomly assigned to a progressive eight-week RT program with a normal protein diet (NP) or high protein diet (HP) (NP 0.85 vs. HP 1.8 g of protein·kg(-1)·day(-1)). One repetition maximum tests, magnetic resonance imaging for cross-sectional muscle area (CSA), body composition, and single muscle fibers mechanical and phenotype characteristics were measured. RT induced a significant gain in strength (+17%, p < 0.0001), whole muscle CSA (p = 0.024), and single muscle fibers CSA (p < 0.05) of LDM in all subjects. Fiber isometric force increased in proportion to CSA (+22%, p < 0.005) and thus no change in specific tension occurred. A significant transition from 2X to 2A myosin expression was induced by training. The protein supplementation showed no significant effects on all measured outcomes except for a smaller reduction of 2X myosin expression. Our results suggest that in LDM protein supplementation does not further enhance RT-induced muscle fiber hypertrophy nor influence mechanic muscle fiber characteristics but partially counteracts the fast-to-slow fiber shift.",

    "abstract": "Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may enhance resistance training induced gain in skeletal muscle mass and strength, but it is unknown if NSAIDs affects muscle loss during periods of inactivity in elderly individuals. Thus, we studied the influence of NSAID treatment on human skeletal muscle during immobilization and rehabilitation resistance training (retraining). 19 men (60-80yrs, range) were randomly assigned to ibuprofen (1200mg/d, Ibu) or placebo (Plc). One lower limb was immobilized in a cast for 2weeks and retrained for 6weeks. Moreover, whey protein isolate was ingested (2×20g/d) throughout the whole study period. Plasma inflammatory markers, quadriceps muscle mass and strength, and muscle gene expression were investigated. Muscle mass and strength decreased after 2weeks of immobilization (P<0.001), but returned to baseline levels after 2weeks of retraining combined with whey protein supplementation (P<0.001). Furthermore, muscle mass and strength reached beyond baseline levels after 6weeks of retraining (p<0.05), and NSAID did not significantly affect this (p>0.05). No group-differences, but differences over time, were observed for muscle gene expression of proteolytic and anabolic factors. Plasma inflammatory markers were unaffected by the study intervention and NSAID treatment. Two weeks of lower limb immobilization lead to a reduction in muscle mass and strength, but these parameters were restored already after2 weeks of retraining and whey protein supplementation. After 6weeks of retraining and whey protein supplementation, muscle mass and strength increased beyond baseline levels, and NSAID treatment did not significantly influence this in elderly.",

    "abstract": "We examined if 8 weeks of whey protein (WP) supplementation improved body composition and performance measures in NCAA Division III female basketball players. Subjects were assigned to consume 24 g WP (n = 8; age, 20 ± 2 years; height, 170 ± 6 cm; weight, 66.0 ± 3.1 kg) or 24 g of maltodextrin (MD) (n = 6; age, 21 ± 3 years; height, 169 ± 6 cm; weight, 68.2 ± 7.6 kg) immediately prior to and following training (4 days/week anaerobic and resistance training) for 8 weeks. Prior to (T1) and 8 weeks following supplementation (T2), subjects underwent dual X-ray absorptiometry body composition assessment as well as performance tests. The WP group gained lean mass from T1 to T2 (+1.4 kg, p = 0.003) whereas the MD group trended to gain lean mass (+0.4 kg, p = 0.095). The WP group also lost fat mass from T1 to T2 (-1.0 kg, p = 0.003) whereas the MD group did not (-0.5 kg, p = 0.41). The WP group presented greater gains in 1-repetition maximum (1RM) bench press (+4.9 kg) compared with the MD group (+2.3 kg) (p < 0.05). Moreover, the WP group improved agility from T1 to T2 (p = 0.001) whereas the MD group did not (p = 0.38). Both groups equally increased leg press 1RM, vertical jump, and broad jump performances. This study demonstrates that 8 weeks of WP supplementation improves body composition and select performance variables in previously trained female athletes.",

    "title": "Effects of Whey Protein Alone or as Part of a Multi-ingredient Formulation on Strength, Fat-Free Mass, or Lean Body Mass in Resistance-Trained Individuals: A Meta-analysis.",
    "abstract": "Even though the positive effects of whey protein-containing supplements for optimizing the anabolic responses and adaptations process in resistance-trained individuals have been supported by several investigations, their use continues to be controversial. Additionally, the administration of different multi-ingredient formulations where whey proteins are combined with carbohydrates, other protein sources, creatine, and amino acids or derivatives, has been extensively proposed as an effective strategy to maximize strength and muscle mass gains in athletes. We aimed to systematically summarize and quantify whether whey protein-containing supplements, administered alone or as a part of a multi-ingredient, could improve the effects of resistance training on fat-free mass or lean body mass, and strength in resistance-trained individuals when compared with other iso-energetic supplements containing carbohydrates or other sources of proteins. A structured literature search was conducted on PubMed, Science Direct, Web of Science, Cochrane Libraries, US National Institutes of Health clinicaltrials.gov, SPORTDiscus, and Google Scholar databases. Main inclusion criteria comprised randomized controlled trial study design, adults (aged 18 years and over), resistance-trained individuals, interventions (a resistance training program for a period of 6 weeks or longer, combined with whey protein supplementation administered alone or as a part of a multi-ingredient), and a calorie equivalent contrast supplement from carbohydrates or other non-whey protein sources. Continuous data on fat-free mass and lean body mass, and maximal strength were pooled using a random-effects model. Data from nine randomized controlled trials were included, involving 11 treatments and 192 participants. Overall, with respect to the ingestion of contrast supplements, whey protein supplementation, administered alone or as part of a multi-ingredient, in combination with resistance training, was associated with small extra gains in fat-free mass or lean body mass, resulting in an effect size of g = 0.301, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.032-0.571. Subgroup analyses showed less clear positive trends resulting in small to moderate effect size g = 0.217 (95% CI -0.113 to 0.547) and g = 0.468 (95% CI 0.003-0.934) in favor of whey and multi-ingredient, respectively. Additionally, a positive overall extra effect was also observed to maximize lower (g = 0.316, 95% CI 0.045-0.588) and upper body maximal strength (g = 0.458, 95% CI 0.161-0.755). Subgroup analyses showed smaller superiority to maximize strength gains with respect to the contrast groups for lower body (whey protein: g = 0.343, 95% CI -0.016 to 0.702, multi-ingredient: g = 0.281, 95% CI -0.135 to 0.697) while in the upper body, multi-ingredient (g = 0.612, 95% CI 0.157-1.068) seemed to produce more clear effects than whey protein alone (g = 0.343, 95% CI -0.048 to 0.735). Studies involving interventions of more than 6 weeks on resistance-training individuals are scarce and account for a small number of participants. Furthermore, no studies with an intervention longer than 12 weeks have been found. The variation regarding the supplementation protocol, namely the different doses criteria or timing of ingestion also add some concerns to the studies comparison. Whey protein alone or as a part of a multi-ingredient appears to maximize lean body mass or fat-free mass gain, as well as upper and lower body strength improvement with respect to the ingestion of an iso-energetic equivalent carbohydrate or non-whey protein supplement in resistance-training individuals. This enhancement effect seems to be more evident when whey proteins are consumed within a multi-ingredient containing creatine.",

    "abstract": "Skeletal muscle is an integral body tissue playing key roles in strength, performance, physical function, and metabolic regulation. It is essential for athletes to ensure that they have optimal amounts of muscle mass to ensure peak performance in their given sport. However, the role of maintaining muscle mass during weight loss and as we age is an emerging concept, having implications in chronic disease prevention, functional capacity, and quality of life. Higher-protein diets have been shown to: (1) promote gains in muscle mass, especially when paired with resistance training; (2) spare muscle mass loss during caloric restriction; and (3) attenuate the natural loss of muscle mass that accompanies aging. Protein quality is important to the gain and maintenance of muscle mass. Protein quality is a function of protein digestibility, amino acid content, and the resulting amino acid availability to support metabolic function. Whey protein is one of the highest-quality proteins given its amino acid content (high essential, branched-chain, and leucine amino acid content) and rapid digestibility. Consumption of whey protein has a robust ability to stimulate muscle protein synthesis. In fact, whey protein has been found to stimulate muscle protein synthesis to a greater degree than other proteins such as casein and soy. This review examines the existing data supporting the role for protein consumption, with an emphasis on whey protein, in the regulation of muscle mass and body composition in response to resistance training, caloric restriction, and aging.",

Randomised controlled trial. Three public ART facilities in Jimma, Oromia region, Ethiopia. Adults with HIV eligible for ART with body mass index (BMI) >16. Daily supplementation with 200 g (4600 kJ) of supplement containing whey or soy during either the first three or the subsequent three months of ART. Primary: lean body mass assessed with deuterium dilution, grip strength measured with dynamometers, and physical activity measured with accelerometer and heart rate monitors. Secondary: viral load and CD4 counts. Auxiliary: weight and CD3 and CD8 counts. Of 318 patients enrolled, 210 (66%) were women, mean age was 33 (SD 9), and mean BMI was 19.5 (SD 2.4). At three months, participants receiving the supplements containing whey or soy had increased their lean body mass by 0.85 kg (95% confidence interval 0.16 kg to 1.53 kg) and 0.97 kg (0.29 kg to 1.64 kg), respectively, more than controls. This was accompanied by an increased gain of grip strength of 0.68 kg (-0.11 kg to 1.46 kg) for the whey supplement group and 0.93 kg (0.16 kg to 1.70 kg) for the soy supplement group. There were no effects on physical activity. Total weight gain increased by 2.05 kg (1.12 kg to 2.99 kg) and 2.06 kg (1.14 kg to 2.97 kg) for the whey and soy groups, respectively. In addition, in the whey supplement group overall CD3 counts improved by 150 cells/µL (24 to 275 cells/µL), of which 112 cells/µL (15 to 209 cells/µL) were CD8 and 25 cells/µL (-2 to 53 cells/µL) were CD4. Effects of the soy containing supplement on immune recovery were not significant. The effects of the two supplements, however, were not significantly different in direct comparison. Exploratory analysis showed that relatively more lean body mass was gained by patients with undetectable viral load at three months. Patients receiving delayed supplementation had higher weight gain but lower gains in functional outcomes.

    "abstract": "Knowledge from human exercise studies on regulators of muscle atrophy is lacking, but it is important to understand the underlying mechanisms influencing skeletal muscle protein turnover and net protein gain. This study examined the regulation of muscle atrophy-related factors, including atrogin-1 and MuRF1, their upstream transcription factors FOXO1 and FOXO3A and the atrogin-1 substrate eIF3-f, in response to unilateral isolated eccentric (ECC) vs. concentric (CONC) exercise and training. Exercise was performed with whey protein hydrolysate (WPH) or isocaloric carbohydrate (CHO) supplementation. Twenty-four subjects were divided into WPH and CHO groups and completed both single-bout exercise and 12 wk of training. Single-bout ECC exercise decreased atrogin-1 and FOXO3A mRNA compared with basal and CONC exercise, while MuRF1 mRNA was upregulated compared with basal. ECC exercise downregulated FOXO1 and phospho-FOXO1 protein compared with basal, and phospho-FOXO3A was downregulated compared with CONC. CONC single-bout exercise mediated a greater increase in MuRF1 mRNA and increased FOXO1 mRNA compared with basal and ECC. CONC exercise downregulated FOXO1, FOXO3A, and eIF3-f protein compared with basal. Following training, an increase in basal phospho-FOXO1 was observed. While WPH supplementation with ECC and CONC training further increased muscle hypertrophy, it did not have an additional effect on mRNA or protein levels of the targets measured. In conclusion, atrogin-1, MuRF1, FOXO1/3A, and eIF3-f mRNA, and protein levels, are differentially regulated by exercise contraction mode but not WPH supplementation combined with hypertrophy-inducing training. This highlights the complexity in understanding the differing roles these factors play in healthy muscle adaptation to exercise.",

    "abstract": "One of the major pathophysiologies in advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has been attributed to systemic inflammation. Meta-analysis of the 2005 Cochrane Database concluded the effect of nutritional supplementation alone on stable COPD was insufficient to promote body weight gain or exercise capacity. The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of nutritional supplementation therapy using a nutritional supplement containing whey peptide with low-intensity exercise therapy in stable elderly patients with COPD. In stable elderly COPD patients with %IBW and %FEV(1) of less than 110 and 80%, respectively, anti-inflammatory nutritional supplementation therapy was added to low-intensity exercise therapy. Thirty-six COPD patients were divided into those with and those without the ingestion of an anti-inflammatory nutritional supplement containing whey peptide, which exhibited an anti-inflammatory effect. These two groups were designated as the nutritional support and the control groups, respectively. The body composition, skeletal muscle strength, exercise tolerance, health-related QOL (HRQOL), and inflammatory cytokines were evaluated before and three months after nutritional support combined with exercise therapy in both the nutritional support group and the control group. In the nutritional support group, the body weight, %IBW, FM, energy intake, %AC, Alb, PImax, PEmax, 6MWD, WBI, emotional function, and CRQ total were significantly increased, and the levels of hsCRP, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α were reduced significantly, while no significant change was noted in any item of physiological evaluation or any biomarker in the control group. Concomitant use of a anti-inflammatory nutritional supplement containing whey peptide, which exhibits an anti-inflammatory effect, with exercise therapy in stable elderly COPD patients with %IBW<110% and %FEV(1)<80% may not only increase body weight but may also inhibit systemic inflammation and thus improve exercise tolerance and HRQOL.",

The purpose of this study was to examine the use of protein supplementation, alone or in association with other supplements, and dietary behavior amongst regular fitness center attendees in Palermo, Italy. Resistance training information have been collected from 800 regular fitness center attendees for the initial analysis. A specific questionnaire was generated for the experimentation. Data were collected using a face-to-face interview method. Supplement users were then compared to the non users and analyzed using a one-way ANOVA, Kruskall-Wallis, chi-square test or exact test of Fisher when appropriate. 30.1% of the respondents use dietary supplements during their training as a believe it is the \"way to gain muscles and strength\". Whey protein shakes (50.0%) mixed with creatine and amino-acids (48.3%) were the most frequent choices amongst the users. A majority of the subjects (34.0%) appeared to rely on their gym instructors' advice for their intake; a lower proportion (13.0%) consulted physicians, while none of them consulted nutritionists. A high consumption of milk has been noticed in both users (67,7%) and non-users (52,8%); supplement non-users consumed significantly more snacks and bakery products than users per week (P < 0.001), while users consumed significantly more protein-rich foods (P < 0.01) with a particular preference for meat (48.0%). A considerable number of regular strength training adepts consume protein supplements mixed with other products (mainly creatine and amino-acids). Limited numbers consult \"dietary specialists\" and rely mainly on their instructors. We emphasize on the importance of the dissemination of scientifically based information about supplementation in this environment and the promotion of updated educational programs for the instructors.",

    "abstract": "Different dietary proteins affect whole body protein anabolism and accretion and therefore, have the potential to influence results obtained from resistance training. This study examined the effects of supplementation with two proteins, hydrolyzed whey isolate (WI) and casein (C), on strength, body composition, and plasma glutamine levels during a 10 wk, supervised resistance training program. In a double-blind protocol, 13 male, recreational bodybuilders supplemented their normal diet with either WI or C (1.5 gm/kg body wt/d) for the duration of the program. Strength was assessed by 1-RM in three exercises (barbell bench press, squat, and cable pull-down). Body composition was assessed by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Plasma glutamine levels were determined by the enzymatic method with spectrophotometric detection. All assessments occurred in the week before and the week following 10 wk of training. Plasma glutamine levels did not change in either supplement group following the intervention. The WI group achieved a significantly greater gain (P < 0.01) in lean mass than the C group (5.0 +/- 0.3 vs. 0.8 +/- 0.4 kg for WI and C, respectively) and a significant (P < 0.05) change in fat mass (-1.5 +/- 0.5 kg) compared to the C group (+0.2 +/- 0.3 kg). The WI group also achieved significantly greater (P < 0.05) improvements in strength compared to the C group in each assessment of strength. When the strength changes were expressed relative to body weight, the WI group still achieved significantly greater (P < 0.05) improvements in strength compared to the C group.",

    "abstract": "A survey was conducted to examine the source of information and usage of nutritional supplements in 115 male and 88 female varsity athletes at a Division I university. The survey asked each athlete to define supplement, and report supplement use and type, source of information, and reasons for use. Supplement use frequencies were determined, and comparisons were made between gender and sport. Eighty-nine percent of the subjects had or were currently using nutritional supplements. Many athletes did not consider sports drinks and calorie replacement products as supplements. Females were more likely to take calcium and multivitamins, and males had significant intake for ginseng, amino acids, glutamine, hydroxy-methyl-buterate (HMB), weight gainers, whey protein, and Juven. The most frequently used supplements overall were energy drinks (73%), calorie replacement products of all types (61.4%), multivitamin (47.3%), creatine (37.2%), and vitamin C (32.4%). There was also significant supplement use noted per sport. Females were more likely to obtain information from family members regarding supplementation, and males from a store nutritionist, fellow athletes, friends, or a coach. Female athletes were more likely to take supplements for their health or because of an inadequate diet, while men reported taking supplements to improve speed and agility, strength and power, or for weight/muscle gain.",

    "title": "Meta-analysis of the effects of probiotic supplementation on bone turnover markers in middle-aged and elderly patients with osteoporosis.",
    "abstract": "Osteoporosis is highly prevalent among postmenopausal women and is characterized by a progressive 1-2% annual decline in bone mineral density (BMD). This deterioration contributes to more than 8.9 million fractures globally each year. The condition arises from an imbalance between bone formation and resorption. Emerging evidence suggests that probiotics may positively modulate bone metabolism through gut microbiota regulation, yet high-quality clinical data directly linking probiotic use to bone turnover markers remains limited. This meta-analysis investigates the effects of probiotic supplementation on bone formation and resorption markers in osteoporotic individuals. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted on 15 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 1,432 participants. The studies assessed various probiotic strains, dosages, and intervention periods ranging from 8 weeks to 12 months. Pooled effect sizes were calculated for key bone formation markers-procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide (P1NP) and osteocalcin-and resorption markers, including C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX-I), N-terminal telopeptide (NTX), and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b (TRAP-5b). Subgroup and dose-response analyses were also performed. Probiotic supplementation significantly improved bone metabolism. Bone formation markers showed notable increases, including a significant rise in P1NP (MD = +8.4 μg/L; 95% CI: 3.1-13.7) and osteocalcin. Bone resorption markers, especially CTX-I, demonstrated significant reductions (SMD = -0.35; 95% CI: -0.52 to -0.18). Multi-strain probiotic formulations produced greater improvements in both bone formation and resorption compared with single-strain interventions. A clear dose-response trend was observed, with higher probiotic doses correlating with stronger increases in P1NP. Subgroup analyses showed that postmenopausal women experienced more pronounced benefits than mixed-gender groups. Probiotic supplementation is associated with enhanced bone formation and reduced bone resorption in individuals with osteoporosis. Multi-strain formulations and higher dosages yielded the greatest improvements, particularly among postmenopausal women. These findings support probiotics as a promising adjunctive strategy for improving bone health and potentially reducing fracture risk. However, longer-term trials and strain-specific mechanistic studies are needed to confirm clinical utility.",

    "abstract": "There is a knowledge gap about the dose-response association between types of protein intake and frailty risk. We designed a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies to synthesize the current evidence on the relationship between total, animal, and plant protein consumption and the risk of frailty. We conducted a systematic literature search across online databases, including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar to identify relevant publications up to August 1, 2025. We calculated the pooled relative risk (RR) and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI) for the highest and lowest protein intake categories, using a random-effects model to account for variation across studies. To shed light on the shape of the association between total, animal, and plant protein intake and frailty, both linear and non-linear dose-response analyses were performed. A total of seven prospective cohort studies were included in the analysis. Among the 125,322 individuals, 18,486 cases were reported during the 3 to 22-year follow-up. Higher total protein consumption was associated with a lower risk of frailty than the lowest intake (RR: 0.79; 95 % CI: 0.62, 1.00; I Our research suggests that higher consumption of total and plant protein is linked to a reduced risk of frailty.

The heterogeneity among studies was evaluated using Q and I We identified 13 longitudinal and 8 cross-sectional studies, comprising 99,453 individuals with 18,893 cases mainly from Asian countries and the United States. Egg consumption closest to 50 g/day was longitudinally linked to a lower risk of cognitive decline (pooled RR = 0.91; 95%CI = 0.83-0.99), and a 'U-shaped' dose-response relationship was also observed at the lowest risks occurring at 50-60 g/day of egg. Stratified by ages, follow-up years, study population and egg intake assessment, the similar 'U-shaped' relationships were also observed. No publication bias was detected.

    "abstract": "Blood lipid concentrations are standard clinical biomarkers of cardiovascular disease risk. Replacing dietary saturated fat with unsaturated fat is expected to lower blood lipids. However, meta-analyses are lacking regarding quantifiable differences in blood lipid response between comparable diets rich in mono-(MUFA) and polyunsaturated fat (PUFA), considering food sources and dose-response. The objective was to compare the effects of \"high PUFA\" compared with \"high MUFA\" diets on fasting blood lipids. PubMed and Web of Science were searched through February 2025 for randomized clinical trials comparing \"high PUFA\" (≥10% of energy intake from PUFAs) and \"high MUFA\" (≥15% of energy intake from MUFAs) diets in adults. Reviewers extracted fasting total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides (TG). Eligible studies were pooled using random-effects models and expressed as mean differences with 95% confidence interval. Fifty-three records were included, representing 1690 adult participants. \"High PUFA\" diets reduced TC [-5.71 (-8.02, -3.40) mg/dL], LDL cholesterol [-3.31 (-5.39, -1.24) mg/dL], HDL cholesterol [-0.77 (-1.27, -0.26) mg/dL], and TG [-6.59 (-8.77, -4.42) mg/dL] compared with \"high MUFA\" diets. Subgroup analyses showed that the effects of LDL cholesterol (P = 0.03), and TG (P = 0.03) were stronger with oil compared with nut or diet interventions. Metaregressions revealed that the benefit of consuming a \"high PUFA\" compared with a \"high MUFA\" diet increases with total fat intake, with a ∼0.5 mg/dL greater reduction in TC (P = 0.01) and LDL cholesterol (P = 0.01) for every 1% increase in energy intake from fat. Cochrane Risk of Bias tool identified some concerns in most of the included records. High PUFA diets have a small, but significant, advantage for lowering blood lipids compared with high MUFA diets and may be a valuable strategy for improving blood lipids in some populations.

We subgrouped anti-PD-1, low-dose anti-CTLA-4 + anti-PD-1, high-dose anti-CTLA-4 + anti-PD-1, and anti-PD-1 + anti-LAG-3 cohorts according to the baseline interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) signature and analyzed these for response and toxicity rates. Whereas in IFN-γ high subgroups the addition of (high-dose) anti-CTLA-4 increased toxicity but not efficacy, the addition of high-dose anti-CTLA-4 to anti-PD-1 increased efficacy in the IFN-γ low subgroup, while toxicity remained low. Our findings suggest that baseline immune signatures may be used to separate risk for toxicity from risk for non-response, with implications for patient stratification and treatment regimens.",

    "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) represents a major global health challenge. Several clinical studies have suggested that Xuebijing (XBJ)-a patented Chinese botanical drug preparation may confer neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory benefits in TBI. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy and safety of XBJ as an adjunctive treatment for TBI. A comprehensive search was performed across nine English and Chinese databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating XBJ in TBI patients, with records screened up to February 2025. Two independent reviewers conducted study selection and data extraction. Pooled estimates were calculated using fixed- or random-effects models, expressed as standardized mean differences (SMDs) or risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Trial sequential analysis (TSA) and the GRADE framework were used to assess evidence robustness and certainty. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses explored potential dose-response patterns and sources of heterogeneity. A total of 33 RCTs involving 3,215 patients with TBI met the inclusion criteria. Pooled analysis demonstrated that XBJ significantly improved neurological function, yielding higher Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores (SMD = 0.66, 95% CI 0.51-0.80) and Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) scores (SMD = 0.78, 95% CI 0.39-1.16), while reducing all-cause mortality (RR = 0.56, 95% CI 0.44-0.69). XBJ also markedly decreased systemic inflammatory biomarkers, including C-reactive protein (CRP; SMD = -1.34), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α; SMD = -0.98), and interleukin-6 (IL-6; SMD = -0.98) (all p < 0.01). No significant increase in adverse drug events (ADEs) was observed (RR = 1.32, 95% CI 0.58-2.96). Subgroup analyses indicated a dose-dependent relationship, with cumulative doses >1,400 mL and twice-daily intravenous administration associated with greater neurological and anti-inflammatory benefits. XBJ appears to be an effective and safe adjunctive therapy for TBI, improving neurological outcomes and reducing inflammatory responses. Dose-dependent effects support the optimization of treatment protocols.",

    "abstract": "C-reactive protein (CRP) has been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events in the setting of primary prevention; however, its risk association in secondary cardiovascular prevention remains unclear. We evaluated the prognostic role of CRP across the spectrum of patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis by screening Embase and MEDLINE databases from inception through November 2024. We included studies reporting adjusted risk associations between CRP and cardiovascular events among patients with ASCVD. Two reviewers extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. Data were extracted using an adaption of the Checklist for Critical Appraisal and Data Extraction for Systematic Review of Prediction Modelling Studies (CHARMS-PF). The primary analysis was conducted using a random-effects model within a Bayesian framework. Risk of bias was assessed using the Quality in Prognosis Studies tool. The GRADE (grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation) approach was used to rate the certainty in the prognostic yield of CRP. The principal outcome was major adverse cardiovascular events. Additional outcomes included: all-cause death, myocardial infarction, cardiovascular death, and cerebrovascular events. We included 27 studies, published from 2002 to 2024, and involving 193,761 participants (65,204 or 34 % females). Higher CRP levels were defined accordingly to the included studies and ranged from 0.5 to 5.0 mg/L 26 studies adjusted for conventional cardiovascular risk factors (age, sex, smoking, diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension); one omitted smoking status but included the others. Higher CRP levels were associated with an increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (adjusted hazard ratio, aHR, 1.55, 95 % credible intervals, CrI, 1.39 to 1.73; tau = 0.24, 95 %CrI 0.14 to 0.34; high certainty), all-cause death (aHR 1.92, 95 %CrI 1.52 to 2.41; tau = 0.30, 95 %CrI 0.14 to 0.51; moderate certainty), myocardial infarction (aHR 1.40, 95 %CrI 1.22 to 1.63; tau = 0.066, 95 %CrI 0.001 to 0.28; moderate certainty), and cardiovascular death (aHR 1.35, 95 %CrI 0.98 to 1.84; tau = 0.20, 95 %CrI 0.001 to 0.54; low certainty) after adjustment for traditional risk factors. The association between CRP and the risk of cerebrovascular events was inconclusive (aHR 1.52, 95 %CrI 0.69 to 3.32; tau = 0.33 95 %CrI 0.001 to 0.85; very low certainty). Dose-response Bayesian meta-analysis showed a non-linear association between CRP and major cardiovascular events, with levels between 2 and 4 mg/L being associated with clinically relevant higher risk. A similar dose-response relationship was observed also for all-cause death. Among patients with ASCVD, elevated levels of CRP are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events. Systematic screening of CRP in secondary cardiovascular prevention could improve the identification of patients at risk of recurrent cardiovascular events. CRD42025636822.",

    "abstract": "Actinic keratosis (AK) is a precancerous, UV-induced skin lesion that can progress to cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. Although UVR drives field cancerization and immunosuppression in the skin, keratinocyte-intrinsic responses to chronic, low-dose UV exposure have been insufficiently studied in AK. We established a patient-derived in vitro model using primary keratinocytes from AK lesions and age-matched, sun-exposed skin to investigate how repeated low-dose UV irradiation shapes keratinocyte stress responses. Integrating morphological profiling, cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer quantification, and bulk RNA sequencing, we observed morphological remodeling and accumulating DNA damage in AK keratinocytes despite activation of DNA repair and unfolded protein response pathways. Transcriptomic analyses revealed constitutive and UV-enhanced IFN signaling in AK cells, including upregulation of innate DNA sensing and ISGylation genes. Meta-analysis of 5 independent datasets validated IFN pathway activation as a conserved feature of AK, and IFNα exposure further sensitized AK keratinocytes to UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer accumulation. Immunohistochemistry confirmed lesion-specific enrichment of ISG15 and UBE2L6 in AK epidermis, indicating spatially confined IFN pathway activation in vivo. Our model uncovers sustained IFN signaling and attenuated DNA damage repair as keratinocyte-intrinsic features of AK, suggesting that persistent IFN responses may modulate UV-induced damage responses and contribute to early photocarcinogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is increasingly recognized as a potential contributor to early renal injury. However, whether OSA independently affects kidney function in individuals without known kidney disease remains uncertain. Early identification of subclinical renal damage is crucial for timely intervention. A systematic search was conducted across PubMed, Embase, MEDLINE, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane Library databases from inception to July 7, 2025. Eligible studies included adults without diagnosed chronic kidney disease and reported at least one renal biomarker. Pooled standardized mean differences (SMDs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated, and correlation coefficients were converted to Fisher z-scores for pooling. Twenty-six studies with 4302 participants were included. Compared to non-OSA controls, OSA patients exhibited significantly higher levels of urinary microalbumin (UmAlb) (SMD = 0.79), cystatin C (CysC) (SMD = 0.47), urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (uACR) (SMD = 0.49), neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) (SMD = 0.34), and interleukin-18 (IL-18) (SMD = 2.27) (all P < 0.05). No significant association was observed for KIM-1, β OSA was associated with multiple biomarkers of early kidney damage, even in individuals without underlying kidney disease. The study findings revealed a dose-response relationship between OSA severity and elevated biomarker levels, highlighting hypertension as an important effect modifier. Easily accessible markers such as CysC and UmAlb may aid in the early detection of subclinical kidney damage in OSA populations, thereby supporting earlier risk stratification and intervention strategies.",

    "abstract": "Preoperative administration of tranexamic acid (TXA) reduces perioperative blood loss and transfusion requirements in total hip arthroplasty (THA), but optimal dosing remains uncertain due to the narrow range of doses explored in prior studies. This study aims to define the dose-response of intravenous TXA in THA, focusing on perioperative haemoglobin drop to improve blood-sparing effect. This monocentric, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, dose-finding study will enrol 170 adults undergoing THA, aiming to randomise 150 patients. Participants will be allocated using a minimisation technique with a random component in equal proportions to receive either placebo or one of four intravenous TXA doses: 300 mg, 500 mg, 1000 mg or 3000 mg. Dose selection and sample size are based on a model-based meta-analysis that employed a maximum effect (Emax) model with a maximum effect of 40% and an ED50 (dose providing 50% of Emax) of 400 mg. The primary outcome will be the relative perioperative haemoglobin drop at postoperative day 3. Secondary outcomes include TXA exposure and perioperative fibrinolytic activity as measured by D-dimer levels. Only patients receiving the allocated study treatment will be analysed (modified intention-to-treat population). The dose-response relationship for the primary outcome will be analysed using non-linear mixed-effect models. The study protocol was approved by the French ethics committee (Institutional Review Board Sud Méditerranée V) and the French National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products (ANSM). Results will be disseminated at conferences and published in peer-reviewed journals. CTIS 2022-502532-38-01; NCT03822793.",

    "abstract": "This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the long-term efficacy and safety of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) as adjunctive therapies for individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and overweight or obesity. A literature search was conducted in June 2023 and updated in June 2025. Eligible studies included adults with T1D, body mass index ≥25 kg/m Exactly 13 studies met the inclusion criteria. GLP-1RA treatment was associated with a body weight reduction of 4.31 kg (95% CI: 3.61-5.00 kg) and a HbA1c reduction of 0.25% (95% CI: 0.18-0.32%). Across all studies, insulin dosage was reduced by 9.24 U/day (95% CI: 7.04-11.45 U/day). Subgroup analysis identified that semaglutide achieved the greatest reductions in all outcome measures. Hypoglycaemic episodes were increased (OR = 1.34; 95% CI: 1.02-1.76), while hyperglycaemic episodes decreased (OR: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.56-0.87). Gastrointestinal adverse events, including nausea and vomiting, were significantly more frequent with GLP-1RA treatment, though no increase in serious adverse events was observed. GLP-1RAs are effective for body weight reduction and glycaemic improvement in individuals with T1D and overweight/obesity, with acceptable safety profiles. These findings provide evidence that GLP-1RAs can be effectively and safely used as adjunctive therapy to insulin in people with T1D, but additional robust randomised clinical trials are needed.",

    "abstract": "Acromegaly is a rare endocrine disorder characterized by chronic excess growth hormone (GH) and elevated insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), which are known to have mitogenic and anti-apoptotic effects on breast tissue. While an increased risk of several malignancies has been observed in patients with acromegaly, the relationship between acromegaly and breast cancer remains unclear. To systematically evaluate the incidence and prevalence of breast cancer in patients with acromegaly and assess whether a consistent oncologic risk exists in this population. We systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science from inception through early 2025 for studies reporting breast cancer in acromegaly. Citation tracking identified additional reports. After screening, 24 studies (>17,000 patients) were included, with data on cancer frequency, timing, and GH/IGF-1 levels extracted for analysis. From a subset of these studies reporting standardized incidence ratios (SIR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), a random-effects meta-analysis was performed to generate a pooled SIR, accounting for between-study heterogeneity. This systematic review of 24 studies with diverse designs, encompassing 17,413 patients with acromegaly, found breast cancer prevalence ranging from 0.42% to 5.85%. Several studies reported elevated GH and IGF-1 levels at any cancer diagnosis, but methodological heterogeneity limited conclusions on dose-response or temporal associations. Ten studies reported SIRs with 95% CIs and were included in the pooled analysis. The pooled SIR for breast cancer among patients with acromegaly was 1.20 (95% CI: 0.94-1.54), with moderate heterogeneity (I² = 58%). Although there is a strong biological rationale for a link between GH/IGF-1 excess and breast cancer, current clinical studies have not shown a clear or consistently increased risk in patients with acromegaly. The mixed results likely reflect issues such as surveillance bias, differences in study designs, and limited adjustment for confounders. For now, breast cancer screening in this population should generally follow the same guidelines as the general population, with perhaps closer attention in patients who have poorly controlled disease. Moving forward, well-designed prospective studies that track cancer outcomes in relation to biochemical disease activity and control will be key to answering this question.",

    "abstract": "Taurine, a sulfur-containing amino acid vital for cardiovascular health, is suggested as a promising intervention for reducing cardiometabolic disease risk. In this meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) we sought to evaluate the effects of taurine on cardiometabolic risk factors. We systematically searched PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar for articles reporting RCTs that investigated the effects of taurine on cardiometabolic risk factors. Data extraction was performed in accordance with the Cochrane and PRISMA guidelines. A random-effects model or a common-effect model was used to calculate mean differences (MDs) or standardized mean differences (SMDs). Thirty-four eligible RCTs were analyzed. Taurine supplementation resulted in significant reductions in fasting blood glucose (MD, -5.90 mg/dL; 95% CI, -9.65 to -2.15), glycated hemoglobin A1c (MD, -0.21%; 95% CI, -0.37 to -0.05), fasting insulin (SMD, -0.55; 95% CI, -0.78 to -0.32), homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance index (MD, -0.57; 95% CI, -0.74 to -0.40), triglycerides (MD, -14.42 mg/dL; 95% CI, -23.60 to -5.25), total cholesterol (MD, -12.41 mg/dL; 95% CI, -19.10 to -5.71), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (MD, -5.08 mg/dL; 95% CI, -8.35 to -1.81), systolic blood pressure (MD, -4.38 mmHg; 95% CI, -7.26 to -1.50), diastolic blood pressure (MD, -2.54 mmHg; 95% CI, -3.97 to -1.11), aspartate aminotransferase (MD, -9.65 U/L; 95% CI, -17.39 to -1.90), alanine aminotransferase (MD, -8.26 U/L; 95% CI, -14.81 to -1.70), C-reactive protein (SMD, -1.26; 95% CI, -2.01 to -0.52), tumor necrosis factor-α (MD, -0.35 pg/mL; 95% CI, -0.56 to -0.14), and malondialdehyde (SMD, -1.16; 95% CI, -1.81 to -0.52). Subgroup and dose-response analyses indicated that a daily taurine dose of 1.5-3.0 g was more effective in improving these cardiometabolic risk factors. Specifically, taurine intervention for ≥8 weeks yielded greater improvements in glucose and lipid metabolism, while durations <8 weeks were optimal for managing blood pressure and inflammation. Taurine supplementation may effectively improve cardiometabolic risk factors in adults, underscoring its potential to reduce the incidence of cardiometabolic diseases.

    "abstract": "Chronic inflammation and oxidative stress are central to the development and progression of prediabetes and diabetes. Curcumin, the main bioactive component of turmeric, exhibits anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, though evidence from human randomized controlled trials (RCTs) remains inconsistent. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the effects of curcumin/turmeric supplementation on inflammatory and oxidative stress biomarkers in individuals with prediabetes and diabetes. Comprehensive searches of PubMed, ISI Web of Science, and Scopus up to August 2025 identified RCTs comparing curcumin/turmeric supplementation with controls, reporting biomarkers such as C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), and total antioxidant capacity (TAC). Data from 31 effect sizes across 28 RCTs were pooled using a random-effects model, with subgroup and meta-regression analyses to explore heterogeneity. Curcumin/turmeric supplementation significantly reduced CRP (SMD: - 0.50), TNF-α (SMD: - 1.70), IL-6 (SMD: - 2.97), and MDA (SMD: - 1.31), while significantly increasing GSH (SMD: 1.72) and TAC (SMD: 1.03). Greater improvements in CRP, GSH, and TAC were observed with unformulated curcumin and higher doses (≥ 1 g/day). Publication bias was detected for CRP and GSH, and the overall certainty of evidence was rated low for all biomarkers due to substantial heterogeneity. In conclusion, curcumin/turmeric supplementation may beneficially modulate inflammatory and oxidative stress biomarkers in prediabetes and diabetes, though further high-quality, large-scale RCTs are needed to confirm these findings and determine optimal formulations and dosages.",

    "abstract": "Bridging therapy is often needed for relapsed/refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) receiving chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CART) therapy. Bridging radiotherapy (BRT) is often adopted, but its benefit is uncertain. Here, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to study the adoption of BRT in CART therapy. PubMed, MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched until 13 April 2025 for adult NHL studies adopting BRT before CART therapy. Primary endpoints were 1-year overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS); secondary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR), in-field failure and grade ≥ 3 cytokine-release syndrome (CRS) or immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS). Random-effects model was used for pooled estimates. Meta-regression was done to explore clinical covariates. Fifteen studies including 636 patients were reviewed. Pooled 1-year OS was 67 % and 1-year PFS was 52 %. Pooled ORR was 79 % with complete response rate of 57 %. Pooled in-field failure was 11 %. Pooled Grade ≥ 3 CRS was 5 % while Grade ≥ 3 ICANS was 6 %. Bulky, extra-nodal or advanced-stage disease were associated with worse 1-year OS but not with 1-year PFS nor CART toxicity. Comprehensive BRT covering all lesions was associated with improved 1-year PFS and RT doses > 30  Gy EQD2 was associated with 1-year PFS. BRT leads favourable survival outcome and durable local control while maintaining low rate of severe CRS/ICANS. Comprehensive, adequately dosed irradiation may optimise tumour-burden reduction and improve 1-year PFS. Further prospective studies are warranted to refine RT dose, field coverage and patient selection.",

    "abstract": "Disturbance of inflammatory/oxidative status of the body is an important player in chronic disease pathophysiology. Ginger (Zingiber officinale Roscoe, Zingiberaceae) supplementation has been vastly investigated in this regard. The present dose-response meta-analysis is aimed at summing up the findings of existing literature. Online databases of PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science Core Collection, and Google Scholar were searched for eligible randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on ginger supplementation. Outcome variables included: C-reactive protein (CRP), tumour necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), malondialdehyde (MDA), and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Findings were reported as weighted mean differences (WMDs). Subgroup analysis was conducted. Linear and non-linear associations between dosage/duration of intervention and the observed effects were assessed. Protocol registered in PROSPERO (CRD420251011148(. Twenty-nine RCTs were included. Our findings show that ginger supplementation improves all inflammation/anti-oxidant biomarkers, as follows: CRP (WMD = -0.86 mg/L; 95% CI = - 1.10, - 0.62), TNF-α (WMD = - 1.90 pg/mL; 95% CI = - 2.61, - 1.18), IL-6 (WMD = - 1.15 pg/mL; 95% CI = - 1.90, - 0.41), TAC (WMD = 0.22 mmol/L; 95% CI = 0.06, 0.38), MDA (WMD = - 0.76 mcmol/L; 95% CI = - 1.19, - 0.33), and SOD (WMD = 48.12 u/L; 95% CI = 30.57, 65.58). The effect of ginger on IL-6 seems to associate with the dosage and duration of intervention in a non-linear fashion. Ginger supplementation may improve inflammatory and antioxidant biomarkers, particularly in individuals with underlying health conditions. Given the high heterogeneity among studies, findings should be interpreted cautiously.",

    "abstract": "Overweight and obesity are major health concerns. The impact of ginger on weight has been studied. In the present systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis we aim to sum up the findings from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the effect of ginger on various weight measurements/indices. Several databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science Core Collection, and Google Scholar) were comprehensively searched. Relevant studies were selected using defined criteria. Outcomes included: body weight (BW), body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), body fat percentage (BFP), adiponectin and leptin. Weighted mean difference (WMD) and confidence interval (CI) were reported. Subgroup analysis was carried out. Linear and non-linear associations, based on dosage and duration of interventions, were investigated. Thirty-six RCTs were included. Ginger supplementation significantly improved WC (WMD: -0.65 cm, 95 % CI: -1.07, -0.24), BFP (WMD: -1.49 %, 95 % CI: -2.65, -0.32), and serum adiponectin levels (WMD = 0.84 μg/mL; 95 % CI: 0.01). Other measurements were not improved by the intervention. An inverse, linear association was found between the duration of intervention and changes in BW (BW: coefficient = -0.471, P = 0.001). Also, a non-linear direct association was observed between ginger dosages and WC (P-nonlinearity = 0.023). Ginger supplementation does not seem effective in improving major measurements/indices of weight, including body weight and BMI. However, ameliorations in other measurements of local adiposity, findings from subgroup analyses, and investigations of linear and non-linear association on dosage and duration, indicate that further studies with longer intervention periods are needed to make a conclusive decision.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the association between adherence to the Nordic diet and risks of mortality, chronic disease incidence, and cardiometabolic markers, using a GRADE-assessed systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs). We conducted a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis, searching PubMed, Scopus, and ISI Web of Science through April 10, 2025. Our analysis included 32 prospective cohort studies and 15 RCTs examining Nordic diet adherence and health outcomes. We calculated pooled relative risks (RRs) and weighted mean differences using random-effects or fixed-effects models, assessed heterogeneity with Cochran's Q test and I In prospective cohort studies, individuals with higher adherence to the Nordic dietary pattern had lower risks of all-cause mortality (RR 0.78, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.71-0.86), cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.79-0.80), cancer mortality (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.81-0.91), and other-cause mortality (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.60-0.79) compared to those with lower adherence. Similarly, higher adherence was associated with reduced incidence of type 2 diabetes (12% lower risk), cardiovascular disease (8%), coronary heart disease (11%), stroke (12%), and cancer (16%). In RCTs, participants assigned to the Nordic diet showed significant improvements in fasting glucose, insulin, lipids, and blood pressure compared to control diets. However, no effects were observed for high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein A1, or C-reactive protein. This comprehensive analysis demonstrates that the Nordic diet significantly reduces mortality risk and the incidence of chronic diseases while improving cardiometabolic markers.",

    "title": "Interpretation of the association between thyroid peroxidase antibodies and thyroid function during pregnancy: An individual participant data meta-analysis.",
    "abstract": "Thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb) positivity is the most important risk factor for hypothyroidism and determines thyroid function follow-up during pregnancy. TPOAb positivity is usually defined by manufacturer cut-offs which typically derived from non-pregnant populations. However, as a state of immune tolerance, pregnancy can affect TPOAb concentrations. To improve the understanding of clinical relevance of TPOAb concentrations during pregnancy, we investigated the association of TPOAbs with maternal thyroid function. We performed an individual participant data meta-analysis embedded in the Consortium on Thyroid and Pregnancy. Participants with multiple gestations, pre-existing thyroid disease, thyroid (interfering) medication usage, or conception by in vitro fertilization were excluded. We used mixed effects regression models to assess the association of TPOAb percentiles calculated in each cohort with maternal thyroid function. The study population comprised 62,634 pregnant women from 24 cohorts. As compared to TPOAb percentiles ≤80, there were progressively higher mean thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations across TPOAb percentiles ≥89, with corresponding mean differences ranging from +0.11 SD (95 % confidence interval [CI] +0.04 SD, +0.19 SD) at the 89th percentile to +1.04 SD (95 % CI + 0.96 SD, 1.11 SD) at the 100th percentile. Higher TPOAb percentiles were associated with progressively lower mean free thyroxine (FT4) concentrations across TPOAb percentiles ≥91, with corresponding mean differences ranging from -0.08 SD (95 % CI -0.16 SD, -0.01 SD) at the 91st percentile to -0.48 SD (95 % CI -0.56 SD, -0.4 SD) at the 100th percentile. From the 89th TPOAb percentile upwards, there were progressively higher risks of TSH >4.0 mU/L, with absolute risks of 2.4 %, 4.0 %, and 28.1 % in cases of ≤80th, 89th, and 100th TPOAb percentiles, respectively. Higher TPOAb percentiles were also associated with lower thyroidal response to human chorionic gonadotropin stimulation and higher risks of overt and subclinical hypothyroidism. In 19 of the included cohorts, there were 0.4-6.3 % of pregnant women with TPOAb concentrations lower than the positivity cut-offs but larger than or equal to the 89th-percentile concentrations. The associations of TPOAbs with TSH and with FT4 were most apparent during early pregnancy (P for interaction <0.001 for both TSH and FT4). During pregnancy, TPOAbs were dose-dependently associated with TSH, FT4, and the risk of abnormal thyroid function. With concentrations below currently used positivity cut-offs, TPOAbs could be associated with lower maternal thyroid function, which indicates clinically relevant thyroid autoimmunity. These findings implicates that high normal TPOAb concentrations upon first assessment in pregnancy may warrant active follow-up.",

    "title": "Meta-Analysis of the Efficacy of Spirulina Intervention in Mitigating the Negative Impact of Heat Stress on Production Physiology and Health Indices of Broilers.",
    "abstract": "There is an increasing number of published studies on the effect of spirulina (an aquatic plant known for its high nutritional value and potential health benefits) intervention on productivity and health of heat-stressed broilers. However, the effect of spirulina intervention on the performance of broilers exposed to heat stress is poorly understood. A better understanding of the productivity of heat-stressed broilers on spirulina intervention will assist in utilizing these data in decision-support systems in the poultry industry. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the effectiveness of spirulina intervention in enhancing production physiology and health indices of heat-stressed broilers using a meta-analysis approach. A detailed search performed on PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Web of Science databases on the topic identified 865 publications following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Thirteen peer-reviewed studies comprising 4904 broilers exposed to heat stress conditions were used for meta-analysis. Raw mean differences (RMD) between the heat-stressed broilers with and without spirulina intervention were used to calculate the effect sizes. Heat-stressed broilers on spirulina intervention had their average daily feed intake (ADFI), feed conversion ratio (FCR), and average daily gain (ADG) enhanced by 3.39 g/bird/day (p = 0.002), -0.08 (p = 0.010), and 2.83 g/bird/day (p < 0.001), respectively when compared to those in control group. Restricted subgroup analysis showed that moderators (broiler strains, dose level of spirulina, and production phases) affected ADFI, FCR, and ADG in heat-stressed broilers on spirulina intervention. Dressing percentage (RMD = 1.60%; p < 0.001), and weights of breast, thigh, liver, heart, gizzard, spleen, and thymus were higher, but the abdominal fat weight was lower in response to spirulina intervention. Additionally, spirulina intervention increased the levels of hemoglobin (Hb), red blood cell (RBC), white blood (WBC), total protein, albumin, and globulin, and decreased the levels of uric acid, creatinine, total cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) in broilers exposed to heat stress conditions. The results indicate significant increase in superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), immunoglobulin G (IgG), immunoglobulin M (IgM), immunoglobulin A (IgA), and reduction in malondialdehyde (MDA) in broilers in comparison with controls. It can be concluded that spirulina intervention has the potential to improve growth performance, organ and carcass parameters, blood characteristics, immune functions, and antioxidative capacity of broilers exposed to heat-stress. These findings can be used by farmers, feed manufacturers, poultry nutritionists, and policymakers in decision-support systems to advance the use of spirulina in the poultry industry.",

Recent phase II/III randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have evaluated mRNA-based influenza vaccines, but a quantitative synthesis of their immunogenicity in adults aged ≥65 years is lacking. To determine whether mRNA influenza vaccines yield higher seroconversion rates (SCRs) at 29 days post-vaccination compared to licensed inactivated vaccines in adults aged ≥65 years. Systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs. Hospital, out-patient and community-based RCTs conducted in the USA. We searched PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar from database inception to July 2025 for RCTs reporting SCR at 29 days post-mRNA influenza vaccination in adults aged ≥65 years. Pooled risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using a random-effects model. SCR at day 29 post-vaccination for each influenza strain (A/H1N1, A/H3N2, B/Victoria, B/Yamagata). Seven RCTs out of 4 studies comprising 7,114 participants aged ≥65 years were included. Across the seven RCTs (100% RCTs), mRNA vaccines achieved significantly higher SCRs than controls: A/H1N1 (RR 3.41; 95% CI 2.8-4.2), A/H3N2 (RR 3.54; 95% CI 2.9-4.3), B/Victoria (RR 2.83; 95% CI 2.3-3.5), and B/Yamagata (RR 3.34; 95% CI 2.7-4.2). Heterogeneity was high for all strains (I Visual inspection of Begg's funnel plots for the A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and B/Victoria strains revealed asymmetry, suggesting the possibility of publication bias. There was significant heterogeneity among studies for A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and B/Victoria strains but not B/Yamagata strain. In adults aged ≥65 years, mRNA influenza vaccines elicit substantially higher seroconversion rates across all four seasonal strains compared with licensed inactivated vaccines, suggesting a promising strategy to enhance immune protection in this high-risk population.

    "abstract": "Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and COVID-19 continue to pose significant global public health challenges. Although vaccination is essential for preventing COVID-19 in people with HIV (PWH), evidence on the immunogenicity and safety of booster doses remains limited. This systematic review aimed to assess the immunogenicity and safety of COVID-19 booster vaccination in PWH. We conducted a comprehensive literature search in PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library. Eligible studies included PWH who had received three or more doses of a COVID-19 vaccine. Across 54 included studies, 4,685 of 5,229 PWH achieved seroconversion following a third or subsequent COVID-19 vaccine dose-an improvement over rates observed after the primary vaccine series. In 23 studies comparing 2,284 PWH with 1,813 healthy controls (HC), no significant differences in seroconversion rates were found (p ≥ 0.05). Among PWH, 22 studies reported significantly higher seroconversion rates in individuals with CD4 COVID-19 booster vaccination is effective in enhancing immune protection and reducing severe disease in PWH.

PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were systematically searched. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating Count data were extracted in the form of event occurrences/non-occurrences. NMA was carried out via R. 29 RCTs were encompassed. In contrast to placebo, the avatrombopag 20 mg group demonstrated the highest PR (RR = 12.23, 95% CrI: 5.48-33.72). The combination of eltrombopag and danazol exhibited the lowest incidence of bleeding events (RR = 0.31, 95% CrI: 0.16-0.57), while the avatrombopag 5 mg group had the lowest incidence of SAEs (RR = 0.44, 95% CrI: 0.22-0.84). The comprehensive evaluation suggested that romiplostim, initiated at a dose of 1 μg/kg within a dose-adjustment regimen, may confer one of the most favorable benefit - risk profiles, with a relatively high PR (SUCRA = 75.1%) and a low incidence of bleeding events (SUCRA = 54.8%). When initiating therapy with romiplostim at a dose of 1 μg/kg and subsequently titrating the dosage according to the patient's platelet response, romiplostim may represent one of the most effective therapeutic options.

    "abstract": "Olive oil as food is composed mainly of fatty acids and bioactive compounds with diverse and attractive biological activities that have an inverse relationship with insulin resistance and diabetes-related factors. However, the results of available clinical trials are inconsistent. Therefore, we summarized 51 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and evaluated the association of olive oil intervention with glycemic control in adults. A comprehensive literature search of the PubMed, Scopus, and ISI Web of Sciences databases was performed to identify RCTs investigating the effect of different olive oil types on any glycemic profile component. Quantitative data were synthesized using either a fixed or random-effects model, with a weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% CI for analysis. In the primary search, 2705 articles were found, of which 115 were assessed in full text, and 51 trials (n = 4334 participants) were included in the meta-analysis. We found the consumption of olive oil was not associated with statistically significant changes in blood glucose (WMD = -0.04 mg dL-1; 95% CI, -0.1 to 0.02; P = .18; I2 = 27.05%), insulin (WMD = -0.3 µIU mL-1; 95% CI, -0.99 to 0.38; P = .39; I2 = 91.49%), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) (WMD = 0.02%, 95% CI, -0.01 to 0.06; P = .21; I2 = 0%) and Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) (WMD = -0.09; 95% CI, -0.25 to 0.06; P = .26; I2 = 73.13%). The nonlinear dose-response analysis showed a significant association between the olive dose and HOMA-IR (P = .024 for nonlinearity). Also, the duration of olive oil intervention showed a significant nonlinear relationship with HOMA-IR (P = .025 for nonlinearity), insulin (P = .002 for nonlinearity), and HbA1c (P = .048 for nonlinearity) in dose-response analysis. Our comprehensive review and meta-analysis of 51 RCTs indicate that olive oil consumption by adults does not significantly affect overall glycemic control. However, a daily dose of 25-50 g significantly improves the HOMA-IR parameter, suggesting a potential benefit for diabetes management. These findings highlight the need for further research to fully understand the practical implications of olive oil consumption in diabetes care. PROSPERO registration No. CRD42023459523.",

    "abstract": "Low-carbohydrate diets (LCDs) have emerged as a potential dietary intervention for managing glycemic control, but their effectiveness across different cultural contexts remains unclear. To evaluate the efficacy of LCDs in managing type 2 diabetes, with attention to cultural context, and to clarify how variability in carbohydrate definitions affects interpretation. We searched PubMed, Embase, and Scopus from inception to 1 August 2024 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) ≥ 12 weeks in adults with type 2 diabetes. We conducted exploratory analyses by Eastern versus Western setting and dose-response meta-regression using actual carbohydrate intake at the follow-up. Twenty-seven RCTs (n = 2,870; 7 Eastern, 20 Western) were included. Across analyzed time points, no arm sustained carbohydrate intake < 10 % of total energy; therefore, findings generalize to low-to-moderate carbohydrate rather than very-low-carbohydrate. LCDs improved glycemia short-term: HbA1c - 0.29 %, with the largest effect at 3 months. Fasting blood glucose decreased overall (-7.12 mg/dL). Weight loss was greatest at 3 months and attenuated thereafter. At 3 months, lower actual carbohydrate intake was related to larger HbA1c and weight reductions. LCDs offer modest, short-term metabolic benefits for type 2 diabetes management, but benefits diminish over time. Cultural context may shape responses, underscoring individualized, culturally tailored care.",

    "abstract": "High levels of glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) in people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) are associated with high mortality and cardiovascular risk. Physical activity is an affordable intervention that is available to most people, but the type and amount of exercise to induce metabolic benefits in T1D are not known with certainty. To determine the comparative effectiveness of diverse exercise modes and dosages to influence HbA1c in patients with T1D. The process involved systematically searching PubMed, Web of Science, Embase and The Cochrane Library databases; no limits were imposed on date or language of publication. Bayesian network and dose-response meta-analyses based on a random-effects model were carried out to assess the impact of exercise on the HbA1c levels. Nineteen studies were included in the systematic review. Only multi-component exercise (ME) significantly reduced HbA1c (-0.81%, 95% CrI: -1.33 to -0.34; SUCRA: 93.75%; low-quality evidence). High-intensity interval training (-0.38%, 95% CrI: -1.16 to 0.39; SUCRA: 51.52%) and aerobic exercise (-0.31%, 95% CrI: -0.74 to 0.16; SUCRA: 47.01%) showed no significant benefit. For ME, an L-shaped non-linear dose-response was observed, with statistical significance at 52 metabolic equivalent of task (MET-min/week) and the minimal clinically important difference (MCID; ≥ 0.5% reduction) achieved at 160 MET-min/week (-0.52%, 95% CrI: -0.89 to -0.13). The greatest reduction occurred at 1500 MET-min/week (-0.82%, 95% CrI: -1.31 to -0.27). A dose of ME necessary to achieve MCID (e.g., 10 min of running and curl-ups, three times per week) was well below the American Diabetes Association's minimum recommendation. For adolescents, we recommend combining aerobic and resistance training, performed for at least 12 weeks with 160 to 1200 MET-min/week (equivalent to 25-220 min per week), to balance effectiveness and minimise exercise burden. The high-quality randomized controlled trials of this dose range are required to confirm efficacy and evaluate safety.",

A systematic search of suitable studies was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and ProQuest until February 1, 2024. Mortality and length of stay outcomes of the highest vs. lowest RAR tertile were pooled using hazard ratio (HR) and standardized mean difference (SMD), respectively. Additionally, a dose-response meta-analysis was performed. Publication bias, subgroup, and sensitivity analyses were conducted to address the causes of heterogeneity. Sixteen studies with 30,933 participants were included in the meta-analysis. Pooled results showed that patients with higher RAR faced a significantly higher risk of mortality (HR 1.88, 95%CI 1.59-2.23). Nonlinearity was observed in the dose-response relationship. Using a reference value of 3 ml/g, each 1 ml/g increase in RAR corresponded to a 27% rise in the mortality HR (HR 1.27, 95%CI 1.16-1.39). Our study demonstrated that elevated RAR values were significantly associated with higher mortality in CVD and exhibited a positive dose-response relationship, suggesting its potential as a novel prognostic biomarker for CVD.",

    "abstract": "Colchicine has been incorporated into major clinical guidelines for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, recent randomized trials have presented contradictory results. We aimed to synthesize the current evidence on colchicine in secondary CVD protection, using a cumulative-dose approach. We conducted a meta-analysis incorporating all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) globally. RCTs directly comparing colchicine versus placebo/standard care for the secondary prevention of cerebrovascular or coronary vascular disease were included. Odds ratios (OR) were derived for the primary outcome, defined as the prospective occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Secondary outcomes included mortality, individual components of MACE, C-reactive protein, and adverse effects. In total, 14 RCTs including 31,397 participants were included. Colchicine significantly reduced MACE (OR 0.80; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.68-0.94) in both acute atherothrombotic CVD and all CVD (OR 0.72; 95% CI 0.60-0.86) and resulted in significant prospective reductions in C-reactive protein. The threshold effect was apparent, with a protective benefit of colchicine against MACE at higher cumulative exposure ≥ 90 mg-days (OR 0.66; 95% CI 0.52-0.84). Colchicine resulted in no differences in cardiovascular or non-cardiovascular mortality. Colchicine significantly reduces MACE in both acute atherothrombotic and all CVD across multiple ethnicities, with a threshold protective effect that clinically corresponds to treatment with 0.5 mg daily for at least 6 months. Importantly, there was no signal of increased all-cause mortality. PROSPERO identifier no. CRD420251003142.",

    "abstract": "Antipsychotic drug (AP)-induced glucose homeostasis changes are often attributed to AP-induced weight gain. Nevertheless, dysregulated glucose control can occur independently of weight gain. To examine the association between AP use and glucose homeostasis while considering weight gain propensity, medication type, and treatment duration. MEDLINE, Embase, PsychINFO, CINAHL, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and Web of Science were searched from inception through February 3, 2025. Blinded randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing changes in glucose homeostasis-related parameters between patients with severe mental illness or healthy volunteers assigned to AP or control (placebo or no intervention) groups were included. Studies were limited to English-language human studies without restrictions on study length, AP type, or previous AP exposure. Of 22 773 unique citations, 163 RCTs met inclusion criteria, with 127 studies included in the meta-analysis. Each article was screened independently by 2 authors using predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data extraction and risk of bias assessment were completed using a standardized spreadsheet. Data were analyzed via random-effects meta-analysis, with subgroup analyses for diagnosis, study length, AP type, age, concomitant medication use, and previous AP exposure. Metaregressions identified covariate effects. Data analysis was completed from October 2023 to February 2025. Primary study outcomes were changes in fasting glucose, fasting insulin, and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) following AP treatment. Secondary outcomes included any other glucose metabolism-related parameters including, but not limited to, insulin resistance and hyperglycemia. A total of 35 952 AP-treated patients and 19 010 placebo-treated patients were included in the qualitative synthesis, while 28 975 AP-treated and 15 101 placebo-treated patients were included in the meta-analysis. AP use was associated with significantly increased fasting glucose (mean difference [MD], 0.72 mg/dL; 95% CI, 0.54-1.08 [to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0555]; P < .001), fasting insulin (MD, 1.94 μIU/mL; 95% CI, 1.28-2.61 [to convert to picomoles per liter, multiply by 6]; P < .001), glycated hemoglobin (MD, 0.04%; 95% CI, 0.02%-0.05% [to convert to proportion of total hemoglobin, multiply by 0.01]; P < .001), and hyperglycemia (odds ratio, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.04-1.59; P = .02) vs placebo. Findings were corroborated in healthy volunteers. Subgroup analyses suggested that AP type, diagnosis, age, concomitant medication use, and previous AP exposure do not consistently affect dysglycemia risk. In metaregression analyses, AP-associated dysregulations in glucose homeostasis were independent of study length and AP dose. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, results indicate that AP exposure significantly disrupts glucose homeostasis independent of exposure time, dose, diagnosis, and weight gain propensity. Increased awareness of AP-induced dysregulations in glucose homeostasis alongside ongoing metabolic monitoring and potential treatment is warranted.",

    "title": "Comparative Efficacy and Safety of Different Tenecteplase Doses With Alteplase in Acute Ischemic Stroke: A Systematic Review With Pairwise and Network Meta-Analysis to Determine the Optimal Dose.",
    "abstract": "Tenecteplase (TNK) is a novel thrombolytic agent gaining attention as an alternative to alteplase for treating acute ischemic stroke (AIS). This meta-analysis evaluates the safety and efficacy of various TNK doses compared to alteplase, integrating recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and employing a frequentist network meta-analysis to identify the optimal dose while addressing existing evidence gaps. Up until December 2024, PubMed, Cochrane Central, and ScienceDirect were searched. Using Review Manager 5.4.1 for pairwise meta-analysis, the Risk Ratios (RR) with 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) were pooled under the random effects model. Additionally, R version 4.3.2 and the \"netmeta\" package were used to conduct a network meta-analysis for various dosages of the two thrombolytic drugs. Thirteen RCTs, pooling 9,044 patients, were included in the quantitative synthesis. TNK was associated with a statistically significant improvement in the excellent functional outcome (mRS 0-1) (RR = 1.04; 95% CI: [1.00, 1.08]; p = 0.03) compared to alteplase. No significant differences were observed between TNK and alteplase in terms of good functional outcome (mRS 0-2), poor functional outcome (mRS 5-6), major neurological improvement within 72 h, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH), or mortality at 90 days. On network analysis, TNK 0.25 mg/kg showed significant improvement in excellent functional outcome (RR = 1.05, 95% CI: [1.01, 1.10]) and TNK 0.32 mg/kg in good functional outcome (1.30, 95% CI: [1.15, 1.48]) compared to alteplase. According to the P-score ranking, TNK 0.25 mg/kg was ranked as the best for achieving an excellent outcome (P-score = 0.86), and TNK 0.1 mg/kg as the worst (P-score = 0.16). For symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH), alteplase 0.9 mg/kg was ranked as the best (P-score = 0.71), and TNK 0.4 mg/kg as the worst (P-score = 0.17). TNK (0.25-0.32 mg/kg) demonstrates superior efficacy compared to alteplase in achieving functional outcomes for AIS, while alteplase remains safer regarding sICH. Optimal dosing favors TNK 0.25 mg/kg for efficacy, but safety considerations highlight the need for individualized thrombolytic selection.",

    "title": "Effects of Probiotics and Synbiotics Supplementation on Blood Pressure in Adults with Prediabetes and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A Grade-Assessed Systematic Review and Dose-Response Meta-Analysis.",
    "abstract": "Prediabetes and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are closely linked with increased risk of hypertension, contributing significantly to cardiovascular complications. While probiotics and synbiotics have shown potential benefits in metabolic health, their specific effects on blood pressure (BP) regulation in this population remain unclear. This study aims to evaluate the impact of probiotics and synbiotics supplementation on BP control in adults with prediabetes and T2DM, addressing this critical knowledge gap. A comprehensive search was conducted on online databases from their inception to January 2025 to identify relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Data were extracted from selected studies. The overall effect size was determined using weighted mean differences (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) through a random-effects model. All statistical analyses were carried out using STATA software. The pooled analysis of 17 RCTs (19 effect sizes) with 1,281 participants (646 cases and 635 controls) showed that probiotics and synbiotics supplementation led to a significantly reduction in both systolic BP (WMD: -3.27 mmHg, 95% CI: -5.38 to -1.16, p = 0.002), and diastolic BP (WMD: -1.78 mmHg, 95% CI: -2.61 to -0.95, p < 0.001). The GRADE assessment rated the quality of evidence for SBP as moderate due to significant heterogeneity, which resulted in serious inconsistency; however, no other major limitations were identified. In comparison, the quality of evidence for DBP was rated as very high. This meta-analysis suggests that supplementation with probiotics and synbiotics can effectively reduce BP in adults with prediabetes and T2DM, highlighting their potential as an adjunctive strategy for BP management. Clinically, incorporating these supplements may offer a safe, accessible option to support traditional therapies and help reduce cardiovascular risk in this high-risk population.",

    "abstract": "We aimed to perform a review focused on the effects of dexamethasone on markers of surgical stress in the context of laparoscopic abdominal surgery. This review was registered at PROSPERO. Published reports were evaluated with COVIDENCE, focusing on randomized controlled trials from the MEDLINE, EMBASE and CENTRAL databases. Studies were included if they compared a single intravenous dose of dexamethasone to placebo given preoperatively to adult patients undergoing laparoscopic or robotic assisted abdominal surgery under general anesthesia. The outcome of interest was inflammatory response in general and in particular c-reactive protein. Out of 588 references, we included seven studies. These involved a variety of surgical procedures, with cholecystectomies being the most common, and included mixed gender populations except in studies on gynecology surgery. Due to the heterogeneity in outcomes and the low number of studies no meta-analysis was performed. Levels of c-reactive protein was 38-60 % lower at 24 to 48 hours postoperatively with a dose of 8 mg dexamethasone compared to placebo, predominantly in cholecystectomy cases. Post-trial calculation indicates that the power of these studies ranged between 60% and 95%. Our review may indicate a reduction of surgical stress in laparoscopic abdominal surgery measured by c-reactive protein, when a single dose of dexamethasone is administered.

    "abstract": "We aimed to compare the effects of the progestin-primed ovarian stimulation (PPOS) protocol and gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist (GnRH-A) protocol in women with different ovarian reserves who underwent assisted reproductive technology (ART). We searched published studies in the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Embase, PubMed, CNKI, and CBM databases. Patients in the experimental group underwent the PPOS protocol, and those in the control group underwent the GnRH-A protocol. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomised controlled trials (N-RCTs) of PPOS and GnRH-A protocols were collected. We searched the literature published until November 1, 2024. A subgroup analysis was performed for patients with different ovarian reserves. This study included 36 studies. The primary outcome showed that the live birth rate was similar between the PPOS and GnRH-A groups. In the high ovarian response (HOR) patients, the incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) was significantly lower in the PPOS protocol group than in the GnRH-A group [OR = 0.24, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.12-0.48, p < 0.0001]. In the secondary outcomes, the endometrial thickness in the PPOS protocol group decreased compared with the GnRH-A group (mean difference (MD) =  - 1.13, 95% CI =  - 1.76 to - 0.51, p = 0.0004). In the HOR subgroup, gonadotropin (Gn) dose (MD = 222.88, 95% CI = 59.30-386.46, p = 0.008) and duration (MD = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.48-0.92, p < 0.00001) were increased in the PPOS protocol group compared with the GnRH-A protocol group. In the normal ovarian response (NOR) subgroup, the number of viable embryos in the PPOS protocol group was greater than that in the GnRH-A group (MD = 2.00, 95% CI = 0.10-3.90, p = 0.04). The PPOS protocol had similar clinical effects to the GnRH-A protocol. In HOR patients, the Gn duration and dose in the PPOS protocol group increased, whereas OHSS incidence was reduced. Meanwhile, in NOR patients, the number of viable embryos in the PPOS protocol group increased. The PPOS protocol can be widely promoted in clinical practice when patients do not choose to proceed with fresh embryo transfer due to their own circumstances.",

    "title": "Targeted immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory therapies for idiopathic inflammatory myopathies.",
    "abstract": "Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM) are autoimmune-mediated inflammatory disorders of skeletal muscles with non-muscle involvement in some people. Treatment of IIM represents an area of unmet need; a previous Cochrane review (2012) found little or no evidence to guide treatment. Since then, potentially promising treatments targeting B and T cells and complement inhibitors have been investigated. To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of targeted immunosuppressant and immunomodulatory treatments for the idiopathic inflammatory myopathies: dermatomyositis (DM, including juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM) and amyopathic dermatomyositis), immune-mediated necrotising myopathy (IMNM), anti-synthetase syndrome (ASS), overlap-myositis (OM), polymyositis (PM) and cancer-related myositis. We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and clinical trial registers until February 2023. We intended to check references and citations, and contact experts to identify additional studies, but lacked the resources. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs of targeted immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory therapies in adults and children with IIM. Primary outcomes were improvement of function or disability and improvement of muscle strength. Secondary outcomes were achievement of definitions of improvement, cumulative corticosteroid dose, change in skin disease activity, serious adverse event and withdrawals for lack of benefit or adverse events. Our preferred follow-up was six months, although we accepted three months. We followed standard Cochrane methodology. To assess risk of bias we used the domain-based Cochrane tool (RoB 1). We used fixed-effect models, and, when needed, random-effects models for meta-analysis. We created summary of findings tables for any comparison for which data were available, but chose in advance to prioritise comparisons of rituximab, abatacept or complement inhibitors with placebo, no treatment or standard care. We assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE. We included 16 studies (830 participants). All studies were at risk of bias (10/16 high risk in at least one domain; four studies with unclear risk in ≥ 2 domains judged as high risk). Selective reporting was the most frequent reason for high risk of bias (37%). None of the treatments assessed showed moderate or high-certainty evidence of response compared to placebo for any of the primary or secondary outcomes. Improvement of function or disability For rituximab, function or disability improvement was not reported separately. Abatacept may have little or no effect on disability measured as change on the Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) (range 0 to 3, lower scores better) (mean difference (MD) -0.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.29 to 0.02; 2 RCTs, 147 participants; low certainty). For complement inhibitors, the evidence for change on the HAQ-DI is very uncertain (MD -0.15, 95% CI -0.61 to 0.32; 1 RCT, 26 participants; very low certainty). Improvement of muscle strength Muscle strength was not reported separately in the rituximab study. Abatacept may have little or no effect on muscle strength (Manual Muscle Test-8 (MMT8): range 0 to 150 bilateral, 0 to 80 unilateral; higher scores better) (MD 3.6, 95% CI -0.15 to 7.35; 2 RCTs, number of participants unclear; low certainty). For complement inhibitors, there was no clear difference in muscle strength (proximal muscle strength score, range 0 to 140, 140 equates to full strength) (MD 3.89, 95% CI -6.17 to 13.95; 1 RCT, 25 participants; very low certainty). Achievement of definitions of improvement International Myositis Assessment and Clinical Studies Group definitions of improvement (IMACS DOI) In the rituximab study, the evidence for the effect on the IMACS DOI is very uncertain and could favour rituximab or placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.72, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.34; 1 RCT, 200 participants; very low certainty). Response was measured at eight weeks (shorter than our preferred time point) and was considered indirect. Abatacept may improve achievement of IMACS DOI after three to six months (RR 1.42, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.98; 2 RCTs, 167 participants; low certainty). Myositis Response Criteria Total Improvement Score (TIS) Achievement of moderate or major TIS was reported for abatacept but could favour abatacept or placebo (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.57; 1 RCT, 120 participants). TIS minimal improvement was reported for complement inhibitors and could favour treatment or placebo (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.51 to 2.31; 1 RCT, 25 participants; very low certainty). Cumulative corticosteroid dose Cumulative steroid dose was not measured or reported separately in the selected studies. Change in skin disease activity Change in Cutaneous Dermatomyositis Disease Area and Severity Index (CDASI) was not measured in the selected studies. Serious adverse event We were unable to extract serious adverse event data for the randomised period of the rituximab study. For abatacept, the evidence was very uncertain because of study limitations and serious imprecision (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.25 to 3.75; 2 RCTs, 167 participants; very low certainty). For complement inhibitors, the evidence was very uncertain (RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.01 to 3.11; 2 RCTs, 40 participants; very low certainty). Withdrawals for either lack of benefit or adverse events For rituximab, the evidence was very uncertain (RR 1.47, 95% CI 0.25 to 8.59; 1 RCT, 190 participants; very low certainty). The evidence was very uncertain for abatacept (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.19 to 2.14; 2 RCTs, 167 participants; very low certainty). For complement inhibitors, one study reported no withdrawals (27 participants) and the other did not provide data (very low certainty). The evidence for the use of rituximab, abatacept and complement inhibitors in IIM is largely uncertain. Abatacept may improve achievement of IMACS DOI at three or six months, although the evidence is of low certainty. More research is needed to investigate the benefits and harms of targeted immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory therapies in IIM. Ideally, studies should be sufficiently powered to ensure detection of effects in subgroups (e.g. IMNM, DM, ASS). Because of the rarity of IIM, international collaborative efforts should be encouraged to embark on multicentre trials.",

    "abstract": "This meta-analysis aims to evaluate efficacy and safety of tirzepatide for weight loss, including its dose-response relationship and adverse event profile. Studies were retrieved from high-impact journals and included phase 1 to phase 3 trials. Participants received tirzepatide at 5,10, or 15 mg doses or a placebo control. Weighted mean differences (WMD) and odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to evaluate treatment effects, and heterogeneity was assessed using I² statistic. Tirzepatide induced a mean weight reduction of -10.39 kg versus placebo (95% CI: -10.80 to -9.99; p < 0.00001). Subgroup analyses by diabetes status showed that patients with type 2 diabetes lost -6.17 kg (95% CI: -7.16 to -5.17; p < 0.00001) at 5 mg, -8.57 kg (95% CI: -9.41 to -7.74; p < 0.00001) at 10 mg, and -9.60 kg (95% CI: -10.32 to -8.89; p < 0.00001) at 15 mg. Non-diabetic participants experienced greater absolute losses of -12.10 kg (95% CI: -13.47 to -10.72; p < 0.00001), -15.94 kg (95% CI: -17.25 to -14.62; p < 0.00001), and -17.86 kg (95% CI: -19.19 to -16.54; p < 0.00001) at the respective doses. Tirzepatide also markedly increased the odds of achieving clinically meaningful weight loss: ≥ 5% (OR=11.32; p < 0.0001), ≥ 10% (OR=14.77; p < 0.0001), and ≥ 15% (OR=18.07; p < 0.0001. Adverse events were more frequent with tirzepatide than placebo (OR=1.34; p < 0.0001), largely driven by gastrointestinal symptoms, whereas serious adverse events did not differ. Discontinuations due to side effects increased at higher doses (OR=2.31; p < 0.0001). Tirzepatide induces significant, dose-dependent weight loss, with higher doses yielding greater reductions. While gastrointestinal side effects were common, they were generally mild to moderate and did not increase serious adverse events. These findings support tirzepatide as an effective weight management therapy, though strategies to mitigate gastrointestinal symptoms may improve adherence.",

    "abstract": "Compared with alteplase, recombinant human prourokinase (rhPro-UK)-a next-generation specific plasminogen activator-offers advantages such as weight-independent dosing and cost effectiveness. While a 35-mg dose of rhPro-UK has been recommended in previous randomized controlled trials (RCTs), its efficacy and safety profile have yet to be fully elucidated, as no relevant systematic reviews or meta-analyses have been conducted to date. This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 35 mg of rhPro-UK compared with those of control treatments, including 50 mg of rhPro-UK and alteplase monotherapy, in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Two independent reviewers systematically searched the PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and ClinicalTrials.gov electronic databases up to May 24, 2025, to identify RCTs assessing the effects of 35 mg rhPro-UK versus control therapies in AIS patients. Study quality was assessed using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool. A random effects model was employed for the meta-analysis using Stata 18.0. Four RCTs involving 2412 patients were included. The 35-mg dose of rhPro-UK demonstrated comparable safety and efficacy to those of the other treatments. Notably, this dose was associated with the potential advantages of increasing early neurological recovery at 24 h (SMD = - 0.29, 95% CI - 0.55 to - 0.03, P = 0.03) and reducing systemic bleeding risk at 90 days (RR = 0.59, 95% CI 0.48-0.73, P < 0.001). Subgroup analysis suggested that 35 mg of rhPro-UK might be associated with lower odds of SAEs than 50 mg of rhPro-UK (I This meta-analysis suggested that 35 mg of rhPro-UK does not significantly differ from 50 mg of rhPro-UK or alteplase in terms of clinical outcomes among AIS patients. However, the 35-mg dose of rhPro-UK has the potential advantages of enhancing early neurological recovery and reducing the risk of systemic bleeding. Subgroup analysis revealed that 35 mg of rhPro-UK might be associated with a lower risk of SAEs than 50 mg of rhPro-UK.",

    "abstract": "Sepsis is a life-threatening condition associated with high mortality due to an unregulated host immune response. Extracorporeal blood purification (EBP) therapies have been proposed as adjunctive treatments to immunomodulate patients; however, none have been consistently shown to be effective in reducing mortality. In several observational studies, Oxiris has been associated with cytokine reduction and a potential benefit in influencing inflammatory diseases. This meta-analysis explores the association between cytokine removal and clinical efficacy of the Oxiris membrane using interleukin-6 (IL-6) as a biomarker. This review includes articles on EBP with Oxiris membranes in adult patients with sepsis/septic shock or COVID-19. No time or language restrictions were applied to the systematic literature search. Data extraction and statistical analysis were limited to the cytokines and clinical data reported in the included articles. The most representative cytokine was IL-6 and the selected outcomes included Vasoactive-Inotropic Score (VIS), SOFA score, procalcitonin (PCT) and C-reactive protein (CRP). The review used meta-analysis and unpaired t test to estimate differences between groups of patients treated with or without Oxiris. The study found no significant differences in demographics between the intervention and control groups at baseline. Intervention group showed a significant reduction in vasoactive inotropic score, norepinephrine dose, SOFA score, PCT, and CRP. We reviewed 8 studies in which IL-6 was significantly reduced in the Oxiris group compared to the control. This meta-analysis found that the use of the Oxiris membrane resulted in significant clinical improvement during treatment.",

    "title": "Does Nigella sativa supplementation improve cardiovascular disease risk factors? A comprehensive GRADE-assessed systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of 82 randomized controlled trials.",
    "abstract": "This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effects of Nigella sativa (N. sativa) supplementation on metabolic and cardiovascular health outcomes. A comprehensive search of EMBASE, Scopus, PubMed, CENTRAL, and Web of Science databases was conducted up to August 2024. Study quality and certainty of evidence were assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) tools, respectively. Eighty-two studies, including 79 quantitative and 3 qualitative studies published between 2008 and 2024, involving 5026 participants with interventions ranging from 1 to 48 weeks and doses varying from 200 to 4600 mg/day, were included. N. sativa supplementation significantly improved body fat percentage (BF%), body mass index (BMI), skeletal muscle mass (SMM), waist circumference (WC), weight, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), systolic blood pressure (SBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), fasting blood sugar (FBS), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), postprandial blood glucose (PPBG), quick insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI), C-reactive protein (CRP), high-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), atherogenic index (AI), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol (TC) to HDL-C ratio, TC, triglycerides (TG), very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), creatinine, urea, catalase (CAT), malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase activity (SOD) activity, and total antioxidant capacity (TAC). Our findings suggest that N. sativa could be a promising adjunct therapy for improving cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors.",

    "title": "Establishing a Quantitative Framework for Combined Oral Contraceptives: Evaluating the Impact of Drug-Drug Interactions on Exposure and Clinical (Surrogate) Efficacy Endpoints.",
    "abstract": "According to the FDA Guidance for Industry on Clinical Drug Interaction (DDI) Studies with Combined Oral Contraceptives (COCs), sponsors are expected to conduct dedicated clinical DDI studies if in vitro findings suggest weak or moderate CYP3A induction, while concomitant use of COCs with strong inducers should be avoided. The guidance further suggests that a negative DDI result for drospirenone (DRSP) may be extrapolated to other progestins that are less sensitive to CYP3A modulation, such as levonorgestrel (LNG). This approach assumes that DDI-mediated changes in exposure directly translate into clinical efficacy across progestins. To evaluate the validity of this assumption, we established a quantitative link between dose, exposure, and response (Pearl Index [PI] and ovulation rate [OR]) via an integrated model-based meta-analysis, physiologically based pharmacokinetic, and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) modeling and simulation approach using data from 51 clinical studies in 36,040 women receiving LNG or DRSP. COCs containing LNG and DRSP were selected because they represent clinically relevant progestins at the lower and the upper end of the fraction metabolized via CYP3A4. The results of our analysis show a moderate correlation (Pearson's r = 0.52, 95% CI 0.46-0.58, P < 0.001) between PI and OR, which enables the use of OR as an ethically measurable endpoint, even at subtherapeutic doses/exposures, to predict efficacy outcomes. They further show that DDI-induced changes in exposure do not directly translate into clinical response. Therefore, DDIs with COCs should be interpreted in a PK/PD rather than a PK-only context. The quantitative framework developed in this study can serve as the scientific basis to do so.",

    "abstract": "No correlation between the dose, adverse events, and efficacy was detected in clinical trials of anti-PD-1 antibodies across a range of solid and hematological malignancies. Given that dose reduction with potentially comparable clinical efficacy may improve access to treatment, particularly in low-income regions, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of low-dose PD-1 inhibitor monotherapy in relapsed/refractory (r/r) classic Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL). Relevant reports were identified through PUBMED, MEDLINE, Cochrane, ScienceDirect databases, and major international conference proceedings, from inception till December 1, 2024. The risk of bias was assessed independently by two authors using the Joanna Briggs's critical appraisal checklist for studies reporting prevalence data. Heterogeneity was assessed using Cochran's Q test, with statistical significance defined as p < 0.05; I After screening, 13 reports including 148 patients were included in the systematic review. After exclusion of duplicated reports, studies with less than 5 patients, and studies with unextractable data, five studies with a total of 84 patients were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled objective response rate (ORR) with low-dose PD-1 inhibition in r/r cHL, as determined by meta-analysis, was 87% (95% CI, 71.9%-100%), with a corresponding complete response (CR) rate of 53.9% (95% CI, 34.7%-73.1%). The ORR with low-dose nivolumab was 83.8% (95% CI, 64.2%-100%), with a CR rate of 43.3% (95% CI, 29.7%-56.9%). The pooled rate of any-grade adverse events after low-dose PD-1 inhibition was 55.7% (95% CI, 36.1%-75.3%), with a grade 3-4 adverse event rate of 7.5% (95% CI, 1.7%-13.3%). This systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrated the high efficacy and acceptable toxicity of low-dose PD-1 inhibition in r/r cHL.",

    "abstract": "Stress hyperglycemia ratio (SHR) refers to the ratio of blood glucose levels to glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels upon admission. As a non-invasive and easily obtainable indicator, there is no systematic evidence-based medical evidence to support the value of SHR in predicting the poor prognosis of critically ill patients at present. PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases were systematically searched with a December 20, 2024 deadline. Prospective and retrospective cohort studies were included. Two investigators independently screened studies and extracted data. The Newcastle-Ottawa scale was applied to appraise the risk of bias in the studies included. Statistical analysis was executed by means of Stata 15.1 software. Study heterogeneity was assessed with the I 39 studies involving 102,414 patients were included. The meta-analysis revealed that SHR exhibited a noticeable positive link with major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), 30-day mortality, one-year mortality, cardiovascular mortality (CVM), and all-cause mortality (ACM) in critically ill patients. Dose-response analysis showed that a positive link of SHR with multiple mortality was noted in critically ill patients. SHR is an independent predictor of mortality in critically ill patients, and its dynamic monitoring could provide essential support for early clinical risk stratification and intervention strategies.",

    "title": "Zinc Supplementation on Growth Performance, Mineral Metabolism and Nutrient Digestibility in Lambs: a Systematic Review and Dose-response Meta-analysis.",
    "abstract": "The effects of dietary zinc (Zn) supplementation on lambs fed diets without added Zn remain controversial, and the precise nature and extent of the associations between Zn administration and lamb responses are not fully understood. To address this, a comprehensive systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis was conducted to explore the effects of Zn supplementation on growth performance, mineral metabolism, and nutrient digestibility. Initially, 3169 studies were identified through comprehensive database searches using relevant keywords. Following a two-stage screening process, 30 eligible articles were selected based on predefined criteria and used in the current meta-analysis. The one-stage random-effects model was utilized in this meta-analysis, with sensitivity analyses conducted to evaluate the robustness of the derived effect sizes. The results showed nonlinear relationships between Zn supplementation and performance parameters. Optimal Zn levels were identified: approximately 28.51 mg/kg DM for maximum dry matter intake, 37.84 mg/kg DM for highest weight gain, and 42.00 mg/kg DM for best feed conversion ratio. Linear increases in fecal and urinary Zn, and a decrease in apparent Zn absorption, were observed with increasing Zn supplementation (P < 0.05). Zinc supplementation up to 53 mg/kg DM enhanced Zn retention, and up to 107 mg/kg DM, increased liver Zn concentration, with the highest concentration at 50.59 mg/kg DM. Zinc supplementation also affected copper and iron concentrations in various tissues. Specifically, it decreased pancreatic copper up to 22 mg/kg DM but increased it above 50 mg/kg DM. In kidney tissue, copper concentration increased linearly with Zn supplementation from 76 to 150 mg/kg DM, while in liver tissue, it decreased from 42 to 150 mg/kg DM. Heart tissue iron concentration increased up to 24 mg/kg DM but decreased from 41 to 150 mg/kg DM, with the highest concentration at 16.31 mg/kg DM. Zinc supplementation at 28.28 and 20.88 mg/kg DM increased total concentration of rumen volatile fatty acids and dry matter digestibility, respectively. However, final weight, carcass weight, nitrogen metabolism, Zn levels in heart, pancreas, and kidney tissues, copper levels in heart tissue, iron levels in pancreas and liver tissues, and the digestibility of most dietary fractions (organic matter, crude protein, NDF, and ADF) were not affected (P > 0.05). In summary, the findings of this meta-analysis generally align with NRC guidelines; this study underscores the necessity of precise Zn supplementation to optimize lamb productivity and mitigate potential adverse effects.",

    "title": "Effects of rumen-protected choline supplementation on lactation performance of dairy cows: A systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis.",
    "abstract": "Peripartum supplementation of rumen-protected choline has been shown to improve cow health and milk production by improving liver function through a reduction in hepatic lipidosis. However, the optimal dose range remains undetermined. To evaluate the effects of supplemented choline chloride on lactation performance and health of dairy cows, a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis were conducted. This meta-analysis followed the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines and used the population (dairy cows), intervention (choline supplementation), comparison (control group vs. choline supplementation), and outcome framework to select studies on dairy cows supplemented with choline. A total of 30 studies from 19 articles and 1 dissertation, identified through Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar, and PubMed, were included. The analysis focused on DMI, milk yield and composition, BW, and BCS. Study quality and risk of bias were evaluated using systematic review center for laboratory animal experimentation's risk of bias tool. A 1-stage random-effects meta-analysis with a restricted cubic spline model was employed to assess dose-response relationships, with REML used for variance estimation. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed to address heterogeneity and robustness, and publication bias was assessed using funnel plots and adjusted with the trim-and-fill method. This meta-analysis showed the significant effects of choline supplementation on intake and lactation performance of dairy cows. Optimal DMI was reached at 13 to 14 g/d, resulting in an increase of 0.48 kg/d (95% CI: 0.10, 0.87), whereas milk yield peaked at 13 g/d, with an increase of 1.29 kg/d (95% CI: 0.17, 2.41). A significant dose-response relationship for 3.5% FCM yield was observed across 21 trials, with efficacy significantly increasing steadily between 15 and 21 g/d, and a predicted mean difference of 2.19 kg/d at 21 g/d (95% CI: 0.48-3.90). Milk fat yield increased significantly by 0.09 kg/d at a dose of 24 g/d (95% CI: 0.01, 0.17), whereas milk protein yield improved significantly in the 13 to 20 g/d range despite considerable heterogeneity (>50%). A subgroup analysis showed that factors such as parity and level of milk yield had no significant effect on milk protein yield. However, the effects on milk protein yield were only significant in studies conducted between 2012 and 2024 compared with studies conducted between 2000 and 2011. In addition, choline chloride supplementation fed postpartum after 21 DIM had a significant effect compared with feeding before 21 DIM, and the commercial brand of rumen-protected choline also had a significant effect on milk protein yield. No significant effects were observed on milk composition (fat, protein, lactose), MUN, BCS, or prepartum BW, although overall BW increased significantly at a choline chloride dose of 11 g/d, reaching a peak of 12.5 kg (95% CI: 0.01, 24.96). Based on the results, an optimal total choline chloride dose of 13 to 14 g/d is recommended to increase total milk yield. Overall, these results suggest that choline chloride supplementation improves nutrient utilization and increases milk production in dairy cows.",

    "abstract": "Lifestyle intervention, especially dietary modification, has been the cornerstone in preventing type 2 diabetes (T2D). We aimed to investigate the associations of various protein intake exposures with the risk of incident T2D in adults with or without metabolic diseases. We followed 29517 residents enrolled in the Shanghai Suburban Adult Cohort and Biobank (SSACB) without diabetes at baseline through the electronic information system. Cox proportional hazard models were used to evaluate the associations of various protein intake exposures with the risk of incident T2D, visualized by restricted cubic splines (RCS). Propensity-score matching and subgroup analysis were used to characterize the association between total protein and incident T2D by metabolic diseases. Meta-analysis further explored the association between protein intake and incident T2D in broader populations. In SSACB, 1511 (5.1%) participants developed T2D during a median follow-up period of 5.69 years. A U-shaped association between total protein and risk of incident T2D was found (protective range: 12.20-16.85 percentage energy (%E), cut-off point: 14.53%E). The U-shaped association (P-nonlinear < 0.001) remained in adults with hypertension with a narrower protective range (12.20-15.35%E), with a linear association in adults with NAFLD (HR per 1%E: 0.952, 95% CI: [0.910, 0.995]), whereas no significant association in adults with hyperlipidemia or central obesity. A negative association between plant protein and risk of incident T2D was also found in SSACB (HR per 1%E: 0.947, 95% CI: [0.900, 0.996]). In addition, the U-shaped association of total protein with the risk of incident T2D was reaffirmed in the dose-response meta-analysis (cut-off point: 15.10%E). In SSACB, a U-shaped association between total protein intake and risk of incident T2D was found, which was reaffirmed in the dose-response meta-analysis, and differed by metabolic diseases, especially hypertension and NAFLD. Moreover, plant protein was inversely associated with the risk of incident T2D.",

    "abstract": "Distillery byproducts such as brewers grains (BG) have been widely used in dairy cow diets for decades to reduce diet costs and improve nutrient efficiency. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the magnitude of the effects of dietary supplementation with BG on feed intake (DMI), digestibility, milk yield (MY), and feed efficiency (FE) of lactating dairy cows. A total of 12 peer-reviewed articles (n = 472 dairy cows) from 1983 to 2021 were collected systematically with the PRISMA method. The weighted raw mean differences (RMD) between dietary BG and control treatments were estimated with a robust variance estimation. Likewise, diet characteristics, such as CP content, NDF content, type of BG (wet = 1 and dry = 2), DIM, and BG inclusion rate (0 to 75%) were used as covariates in a meta-regression, subset, and dose-response analysis. Compared with the control, dietary BG decreased DMI (19.7 vs. 20.2 kg/d) and tended to increase MY (28.9 vs. 28.4 kg/d), but no effects were observed on FCM yield (29.1 vs. 28.8 kg/d), milk fat (3.8 vs. 3.7%), and milk protein (3.2 vs. 3.2%) concentrations. However, dietary BG increased FE (1.45 vs. 1.34 FCM/DMI) without influencing total-tract DM (61.9 vs. 55.7%) and NDF (49.7 vs. 54.5%) digestibility.

    "title": "Selected laboratory-based biomarkers for assessing vitamin A deficiency in at-risk individuals.",
    "abstract": "Vitamin A deficiency is a highly detrimental micronutrient deficiency associated with poor growth, impaired immune responses, increased incidence of disease, ocular impairments, and maternal and child mortality. Reliable diagnostic assessment of vitamin A status is crucial to inform its clinical management. Currently, direct index measures and dose response biomarkers have been developed to provide assessments of vitamin A status. To determine the accuracy of index tests routinely used as markers of subclinical vitamin A deficiency in individuals at risk for vitamin A deficiency. Secondary objectives are to assess covariates as sources of heterogeneity for the accuracy of index tests routinely used as markers of subclinical vitamin A deficiency. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and six other databases up to 18 August 2022, without restriction (any sex, age, pregnancy status, breastfeeding status, physiological condition, living in any country). We included any studies implementing concurrent measurement of at least one reference standard and one index test to measure vitamin A status. Eligible studies included cross-sectional or cohort-accuracy studies; longitudinal studies; and direct, indirect, and random comparison studies, in which multiple index tests with a reference standard were evaluated. Interventional studies measuring vitamin A status following supplementation or intervention were also included, while case-control studies defining cases by vitamin A status were excluded. Two review authors independently screened studies and extracted data. We evaluated the methodological quality, that is, risk of bias of included studies and their applicability by using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool. When meta-analysis was appropriate, we used random-effects bivariate models to obtain pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity. We stratified all analyses by the reference standard and cutoff used, and assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. We included 40 studies reporting 65 records. None of the studies was designed as a diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) study, limiting our analyses and assessments. Index test performance was described by 25 studies for serum or plasma retinol (SR) versus retinol isotope dilution (RID), 16 studies for SR versus liver vitamin A, eight studies for retinol-binding protein (RBP) versus retinol isotope dilution (RID), three studies for RBP versus liver vitamin A, one study for breast milk vitamin A versus RID, three studies for relative dose response (RDR) versus RID, and four studies for RDR versus liver vitamin A. No studies evaluating modified RDR were eligible for inclusion. Specificity data were available from all studies; sensitivity was often estimable from only a portion of studies due to some studies having no condition-positive cases according to the reference standard (zero true positive and false negative cases). One comparison, RDR versus RID, yielded no sensitivity data, therefore we could evaluate only pooled specificity data. We generally judged risk of bias as 'unclear' across studies. Serum or plasma retinol for diagnosing vitamin A deficiency SR pooled sensitivity against RID at the 0.1 μmol/g cutoff was 10% (95% confidence interval (CI) 2 to 38; 23 studies, 385 participants; very low-certainty evidence), and specificity was 92% (95% CI 85 to 96; 23 studies, 1110 participants; low-certainty evidence). SR pooled sensitivity against RID at the 0.07 μmol/g cutoff was 13% (95% CI 4 to 34; 24 studies, 246 participants; very low-certainty evidence), and specificity was 94% (95% CI 87 to 97, 24 studies, 1295 participants; low-certainty evidence). SR pooled sensitivity against liver vitamin A at the 0.1 μmol/g cutoff was 53% (95% CI 30 to 75; 16 studies, 192 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and specificity was 83% (95% CI 63 to 93; 16 studies, 370 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). SR pooled sensitivity against liver vitamin A at the 0.07 μmol/g cutoff was 54% (95% CI 33 to 74; 16 studies, 137 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and specificity was 79% (95% CI 57 to 91; 16 studies, 348 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Retinol-binding protein for diagnosing vitamin A deficiency RBP pooled sensitivity against RID at the 0.1 μmol/g cutoff was 50% (95% CI 33 to 67; 8 studies, 30 participants; low-certainty evidence) and specificity was 76% (95% CI 72 to 81; 8 studies, 730 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). RBP pooled sensitivity against RID at the 0.07 μmol/g cutoff was 45% (95% CI 31 to 59; 8 studies, 47 participants; low-certainty evidence) and specificity was 77% (95% CI 71 to 82; 8 studies, 711 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). RBP pooled sensitivity against liver vitamin A at the 0.1 μmol/g cutoff was 0% (95% CI 0 to 100; 3 studies, 12 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and specificity was 98% (95% CI 84 to 100; 3 studies, 40 participants; very low-certainty evidence). RBP pooled sensitivity against liver vitamin A at the 0.07 μmol/g cutoff was 0% (95% CI 0 to 100; 3 studies, 9 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and specificity was 98% (95% CI 85 to 100; 3 studies, 43 participants; very low-certainty evidence) Relative dose response for diagnosing vitamin A deficiency RDR pooled sensitivity against RID at the 0.1 μmol/g and 0.07 μmol/g cutoffs were not estimable due to lack of true-positive and false-negative cases from three studies. RDR pooled specificity against RID at the 0.1 μmol/g cutoff was 89% (95% CI 26 to 99; 3 studies, 34 participants; low-certainty evidence), and RDR pooled specificity against RID at the 0.07 μmol/g cutoff was 91% (95% CI 54 to 99; 3 studies, 34 participants; low-certainty evidence). Available data indicate that methods to determine vitamin A deficiency had generally low sensitivity, when estimable (0% to 54%), and generally high specificity (74% to 94%) in individuals at risk for vitamin A deficiency. Estimates should be interpreted with caution because no included studies were designed or conducted as DTA studies. Data assessing the accuracy of the breast milk vitamin A, RDR, and MRDR compared to reference standards, particularly in patients with vitamin A deficiency, are limited.",

    "abstract": "Spasticity is a common complication associated with stroke, and around 72% of stroke patients will develop pain during the disease. Botulinum toxin (BoNT) is a safe and efficacious treatment for spasticity and can improve associated complications, including pain. Hence, this meta-analysis aims to establish whether BoNT can reduce pain-related post-stroke spasticity (pPSS) in the early treatment period (<12 weeks post-stroke) or in the late period (>12 weeks post-stroke) based on the available evidence. This study also aims to establish the dose-response relationship of BoNT-A in pPSS. Based on pooled data from multiple studies, there is no significant difference in the scores measuring pPSS between patients who received early BoNT-A injections and those who received a placebo. This finding suggests that within the early treatment period, BoNT-A may not be more effective than a placebo in reducing pPSS. However, it is important to note that the data for early BoNT-A injections are limited, indicating that research is needed to draw definitive conclusions [",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to elucidate the dose-response relationship between dietary carbohydrate consumption and the improvement of glycemic control and insulin sensitivity in indi-viduals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), following an intensive dietary intervention. Randomized controlled trials published up to December 2023 were systematically reviewed from four databases: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Primary outcomes included: glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting glucose (FG); and secondary outcomes included: BMI, fasting insulin (FI), Homeostasis Model Assessment-Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR). We performed a random-effects dose-response meta-analysis to estimate mean differences (MDs) for each 10% reduction in carbohydrate intake. A total of 38 articles were analyzed, encompassing 2,831 total par-ticipants. Compared to the highest recorded carbohydrate intake (65%), reducing carbohydrate intake to 5% showed that for every 10% decrease, the following improvements were observed: HbA1c (MD: 0.39%; 95%CI: -0.5 to -0.28%), FG (MD: 0.55 mmol/L; 95%CI: -0.82 to -0.28 mmol/L), BMI (MD: -0.83 kg/m2; 95%CI: -1.27 to -0.38 kg/m2), FI (MD: -2.19 pmol/L; 95%CI: -3.64 to -0.73 pmol/L), HOMA-IR (MD: -1.53; 95%CI: -3.09 to 0.03). Reducing dietary carbohydrate intake significantly improves glycemic control and insulin resistance in individuals with type 2 diabetes. A linear reduction in carbohydrate intake was observed, with significant effects occurring within the first 6 months of the intervention. However, these effects diminished beyond this period. Notably, the improvements in glycemic parameters were not significantly affected by whether calorie restriction was implemented.",

    "title": "Clinical insights into IL-23 inhibition: risankizumab for Crohn's disease through a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.",
    "abstract": "Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory disorder with rising global prevalence, marked by abdominal pain, diarrhea, and fatigue. Interleukin (IL)-23 plays a pivotal role in Crohn's disease pathogenesis, making it a therapeutic target. Risankizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting the IL-23 p19 subunit, has shown potential in clinical trials. This meta-analysis evaluates the efficacy and safety of Risankizumab in achieving clinical remission, clinical response, and endoscopic remission in patients with moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted following PRISMA 2020 guidelines. A comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov was performed to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing Risankizumab in Crohn's disease. Primary outcomes were clinical remission, clinical response, and endoscopic remission, with secondary outcomes focusing on treatment-related adverse events. A random-effects model estimated odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals. Meta-regression analyzed dose- and duration-dependent effects. Four RCTs involving 1774 participants showed that Risankizumab significantly improved clinical remission (OR = 2.223), clinical response (OR = 2.483), and endoscopic remission (OR = 4.112). Dose-dependent improvements were observed, with treatment duration affecting clinical remission ( Risankizumab is effective in achieving clinical and endoscopic outcomes in moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease, demonstrating dose-dependent benefits and a favorable safety profile, supporting its use as a therapeutic option. However, the limited number of studies may affect the robustness of these findings. Further large-scale RCTs are needed to validate its long-term efficacy, safety in elderly populations, and effectiveness in biologic-naïve patients. This systematic review and meta-analysis were registered with the INPLASY database under registration number INPLASY202530014. The full protocol is accessible at DOI: 10.37766/inplasy2025.3.0014. How Risankizumab helps treat Crohn’s disease: a review of clinical trial results Crohn’s disease is a long-term condition that causes inflammation in the digestive system. People with Crohn’s disease often experience symptoms like stomach pain, diarrhea, and tiredness, which can significantly affect their daily lives. Researchers have found that a protein called interleukin-23 (IL-23) plays a key role in this disease. Targeting IL-23 may help control the inflammation. Risankizumab is a medicine designed to block a part of IL-23, and it has been tested in clinical trials to see if it can help people with moderate-to-severe Crohn’s disease. To understand how well it works and whether it is safe, we combined the results of multiple high-quality studies in a process called a metaanalysis. Our analysis included four studies with a total of 1,774 patients. We found that Risankizumab significantly improved three key outcomes: Clinical remission: Fewer or no symptoms of Crohn’s disease. Clinical response: Noticeable improvement in symptoms. Endoscopic remission: Healing of the digestive tract, confirmed by a camera test. Patients who received Risankizumab were more likely to achieve these outcomes compared to those who received a placebo. The benefits were stronger with higher doses of the medication and with longer treatment durations for clinical remission. Importantly, the medicine was found to be safe. The rates of side effects were similar between patients taking Risankizumab and those taking a placebo. In conclusion, Risankizumab is an effective and safe treatment for people with moderate-to-severe Crohn’s disease. It helps reduce symptoms, promotes healing in the digestive tract, and works better at higher doses. This makes it a promising option for managing this challenging condition.",

    "title": "Anti-IL-12/23p40 antibodies for induction of remission in Crohn's disease.",
    "abstract": "Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease leading to symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss, fatigue, and complications such as strictures and fistulas. Ustekinumab (CNTO 1275) and briakinumab (ABT-874) are monoclonal antibodies that target the standard p40 subunit of the cytokines interleukin-12 and interleukin-23 (IL-12/23p40), which are involved in the pathogenesis of CD. Briakinumab has been withdrawn for the treatment of CD, making ustekinumab the only available antibody against the p40 subunit of interleukin-12 and interleukin-23 approved for this purpose. To assess the benefits and harms of anti-IL-12/23p40 antibodies for induction of remission in CD, as compared to no treatment, placebo, other drug treatment, or varying dosing schedules. We searched the following databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed, and MEDLINE (from inception to 2 February 2024) and Embase (from inception until 12 August 2022). We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP, references, and conference abstracts to identify additional studies. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of at least four weeks' duration in which monoclonal antibodies against IL-12/23p40 were compared to placebo, no treatment, or another active comparator in people with active CD. We also included trials examining different doses of antibodies against IL-12/23p40. Two review authors independently screened studies for inclusion and extracted data. We assessed the methodological quality of the included studies using Cochrane's RoB 2 tool. The primary outcome was failure to induce clinical remission by week 8, or 6 to 12 as available. Secondary outcomes included failure to induce clinical improvement (clinical response), induction of endoscopic remission, quality of life, and adverse events, serious adverse events, and withdrawals due to adverse events. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) or risk difference (RD) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for each outcome unless substantial heterogeneity was detected. We analyzed data on an intention-to-treat basis. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Eight RCTs involving a total of 3224 participants with CD met the inclusion criteria. All studies were double-blinded. We assessed the risk of bias for most outcomes as either low risk of bias or some concerns. Based on a pooled analysis of three trials, ustekinumab decreased the number of participants failing to achieve clinical remission at eight weeks when compared to placebo. Seventy-four per cent (693/938) of participants in the ustekinumab group and 87% (421/483) of those in the placebo group did not enter clinical remission (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.89; 3 studies; 1421 participants; high-certainty evidence). Treatment with ustekinumab likely did not lead to more serious adverse events when compared to placebo, with 5% (48/966) and 6% (30/505) of participants affected in the ustekinumab and placebo groups, respectively (RD -0.01, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.01; 3 studies; 1471 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). A single small study in children compared two different induction doses of ustekinumab. The evidence for this outcome is very uncertain due to wide CIs. Eighty-one per cent (17/21) of participants receiving the higher induction dose (9 mg/kg or 390 mg) did not enter clinical remission at eight weeks, compared to 78% (18/23) of participants receiving the lower induction dose of 3 mg/kg or 130 mg (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.39; 1 study; 44 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Separate safety data for the eight-week time point were not available for this comparison. Based on one trial comparing ustekinumab to adalimumab, the evidence is very uncertain about which is the more beneficial drug. Fifty per cent (95/191) of participants receiving ustekinumab did not enter remission compared to 52% (101/195) of participants receiving adalimumab (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.17; 1 study; 386 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Separate results on adverse events at eight weeks were not reported for this comparison. Ustekinumab reduces the risk of people with CD failing to enter clinical remission at eight weeks. It probably does not lead to more serious adverse events when compared to placebo. There were inadequate data to conclude the more effective induction dose of ustekinumab in children. No studies evaluated adverse events at eight weeks for this comparison. There may be little to no difference between ustekinumab and other biologics, such as adalimumab or guselkumab, in inducing clinical remission at week 8, but the evidence is very uncertain, and separate data on adverse events at eight weeks were not available.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to assess the effects of different exercise types and their specific doses on glycemic control among individuals with prediabetes. Multiple databases were subjected to a comprehensive search for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published until 15 July 2024. The study protocol was prospectively registered with PROSPERO (CRD42024573186). The exercise interventions analyzed included aerobic exercise (AE), resistance training (RT), and combined aerobic-resistance training (AE+RT). Outcomes were quantified using standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% credible intervals (CrIs), employing the confidence in network meta-analysis (CINeMA) framework for network meta-analysis to confirm the outcome reliability. According to the network meta-analysis, irrespective of dose, AE+RT led to the largest decrease in fasting blood glucose (FBG) (-0.44, [-0.62 to -0.26]). AE alone resulted in the largest reductions in 2-hour post-meal blood glucose (2hPG) (-0.71, [-0.97 to -0.45]) and glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) (-0.30, [-0.37 to -0.22]). Dose-response (DR) analysis identified optimal doses for each exercise type: 880 metabolic equivalent of task minutes per week (METs-min/week) for both AE and RT and 800 METs-min/week for AE+RT to reduce FBG. The optimal dose for 2hPG improvement via AE was 1,100 METs-min/week, and for HbA1c reduction via RT, it was 870 METs-min/week. Given the variety of impaired glucose regulation (IGR), we recommend that people with prediabetes engage in RT at 1,100 METs-min/week to improve 2hPG and at 870 METs-min/week to reduce HbA1c. For FBG control, a dose of 800 METs-min/week is optimal for all exercise modalities. These evidence-based recommendations provide practical guidance for designing personalized exercise prescriptions to manage prediabetes.",

    "abstract": "Mirikizumab, approved for the treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC), may be prescribed in a similar placement to ustekinumab in second-line settings. Payers may compare the economic value when making formulary decisions. This study estimated and compared the cost per remission of the second-line therapies mirikizumab versus ustekinumab in patients with UC. An Excel-based analytic model was developed to estimate the cost per additional patient achieving clinical remission at the end of one year in biologic/Janus kinase inhibitor (JAKi)-experienced patients (second-line therapy) with UC from a United States commercial payer perspective. A network meta-analysis of published pivotal randomized clinical trials was used to derive the number needed to treat (NNT) for clinical response, clinical remission, and endoscopic remission/endoscopic improvement/mucosal healing for ustekinumab and mirikizumab in the study population. The model included the treatment cost (wholesale acquisition costs [WAC] and treatment administration costs) during the induction and maintenance phases. A scenario involving the availability of a ustekinumab biosimilar was also evaluated, assuming the NNT remained the same as ustekinumab but with a WAC set at 50% lower than its current WAC. The costs per patient achieving clinical remission for mirikizumab vs. ustekinumab as a second-line therapy were $461,096 vs. $67,273 during induction and $501,456 vs. $1,079,189 during maintenance. The cost per clinical remission in case of dose escalation during maintenance was lower for mirikizumab vs. ustekinumab ($501,456 vs. $1,569,127). Considering the ustekinumab 130 mg IV biosimilar, the scenario resulted in a lower cost per clinical remission for mirikizumab vs. a ustekinumab biosimilar during the maintenance phase ($501,456 vs. $539,594). Mirikizumab is projected to have a lower cost per remission during maintenance therapy than ustekinumab. Given the need for long-term treatment for this chronic condition, mirikizumab appears to be a cost-efficient treatment option.",

    "abstract": "Recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) and darbepoetin alfa (DA) are key treatments for anemia in individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD), including children, but evidence comparing their efficacy in the pediatric population remains inconclusive. This systematic review, adhering to PRISMA guidelines, analyzed randomized controlled trials and observational studies comparing rHuEPO and DA in pediatric patients with CKD (≤ 18 years; ≥ 10 children per study), searched across medical databases and clinical trial registries until 31/12/2024. The Cochrane Risk of Bias was used for assessment. Meta-analysis evaluated hemoglobin (Hb) increase and cost-effectiveness using the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. From 1298 screened articles, 7 studies were included: 3 prospective studies, 2 randomized open-label non-inferiority trials, and 2 retrospective cohort studies, comprising 208 children for direct comparisons and 357 for transitioning studies. Meta-analysis found no significant Hb improvement differences between rHuEPO and DA after 21-28 weeks of treatment (DA + 0.15 g/dL, 95% CI - 0.22 to + 0.52). rHuEPO was more cost-effective than DA. Transitioning to DA increased Hb by + 0.93 g/dL (95% CI 0.53-1.33) in children with suboptimal levels, after 21-28 weeks of rHuEPO. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of switching to DA was ~ €340 per g/dL of Hb over 24 weeks. rHuEPO is the most cost-effective initial anemia treatment in pediatric CKD. However, transitioning to DA may be considered for patients who do not achieve adequate Hb response. The small number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), variability in dose conversion, and study heterogeneity may limit generalizability. CRD42023460872.",

    "abstract": "To inform an efficient development of new investigational anti-amyloid beta (anti-Aβ) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), a modeling-and-simulation-based strategy was proposed. A general modeling framework that links drug exposures to the time course of amyloid plaque removal and amyloid-related imaging abnormalities characterized by edema and effusion (ARIA-E) was developed based on publicly available data on aducanumab, lecanemab, and donanemab. A non-linear mixed effect model with shared model parameters described the dose response data from aducanumab, lecanemab, and donanemab studies after adjusting for different potency for different antibodies, which allowed the rate of amyloid plaque removal to vary by drug. A time-to-event model was developed to describe ARIA-E incidence. The model assumes that ARIA-E incidence rate is dependent on the rate of amyloid plaque removal with a drug-dependent scaling factor linking amyloid plaque removal rate and treatment-dependent hazard. Simulations of amyloid plaque removal and ARIA-E for a hypothetical anti-Aβ mAb based on certain assumptions and scenarios provided insights into possible outcomes. Overall, the meta-analysis of published data on existing anti-Aβ mAbs could be utilized to model exposure-response relationships and the time course of amyloid plaque removal and ARIA-E incidence of new anti-Aβ mAbs and to inform the design of early clinical trials for them.",

    "abstract": "While abundant research suggests a sex-specific role of endogenous sex steroid hormones in chronic diseases, research on mortality remains inconclusive. We quantified the sex-specific associations of endogenous sex steroid hormones, including total testosterone (TT), free testosterone, bioavailable testosterone, estradiol, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and DHEA sulfate (DHEAS), and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) with risk of all-cause and cause-specific mortality in the general population. Embase, Medline, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central were searched and population-based cohort studies investigating the association of interest were included. The risk of bias was assessed using the ROBINS-E tool. The certainty of evidence was evaluated using the GRADE framework. Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CI were calculated using a random effects model for the top vs bottom tertile of sex hormones and risk of mortality. The systematic review included 53 publications with 359 047 participants. A significant association was observed between higher level of TT and risk of all-cause mortality (HR [95% CI]: 0.89 [0.83-0.97], n = 19 studies) in men, while no association was found in women. Dose-response analysis suggested a significant U-shaped association between TT and all-cause mortality in men and a J-shaped association in women. Higher SHBG level was significantly associated with higher risk of all-cause mortality in women (1.25 [1.13-1.39], n = 3) and no association was observed in men. Additionally, higher DHEAS levels were associated with lower risk of all-cause mortality in men (0.72 [0.57-0.91], n = 6) and no association was observed in women. This meta-analysis reveals a dose-response link between endogenous sex steroid hormones and mortality, highlighting the need for sex-specific studies on hormone modulation's impact on mortality and longevity.",

    "abstract": "The serotonin reuptake transporter (SERT) is responsible for the removal and recycling of the neurotransmitter serotonin from neuronal synapses and is an important pharmacological target for treating a variety of CNS disorders. However, excessive levels of extrasynaptic serotonin resulting from SERT inhibition can lead to serotonin toxicity, which manifests as a spectrum of adverse events (AEs) termed \"serotonin syndrome\" (SS), ranging in severity from mild to life-threatening. We hypothesized that, by performing a model-based meta-analysis (MBMA) of the data in the literature, the dose at which tremors (a characteristic manifestation of SS) occur could be predicted based on the pharmacokinetic properties and SERT inhibitory potency of a given drug. To investigate the relationship between tremors and the predicted relative strength of SERT inhibition, a literature survey was performed to collate observed tremor data, pharmacokinetic parameters, and SERT potency data for known SERT inhibitors.

    "abstract": "Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a widespread incurable chronic inflammation of the colon mucosa. Currently, oral small-molecule medications targeting Janus kinase or sphingosine-1-phosphate and monoclonal antibodies to TNF-α,α4β7 integrins and Ustekinumab are the lines of treatment for UC. Up to 50% of patients either do not react to initial treatment or lose response over time, emphasizing the need for innovative treatment. Mirikizumab, a humanized IgG4-variant monoclonal antibody, binds to subunit p19 of interleukin-23. This systematic review aims to evaluate Mirikizumab compared to placebo in treating moderate-to-severe active UC. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and using the Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome, Study design (PICOS) model for inclusion and exclusion criteria, we systematically reviewed the literature. Our inclusion criteria encompassed randomized controlled trials assessing Mirikizumab efficacy in treating UC across demographics. We employed the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool (RoB1) to investigate bias within included studies across its seven domains. The statistical analysis was conducted using Review Manager Version 5 software. Four studies were included, comparing patients treated with mirikizumab to placebo groups. All doses of mirikizumab administered intravenously demonstrated clinical remission, specifically, the 200 mg and 300 mg doses showed significant efficacy, with risk ratios of 4.74 (95% CI [1.43, 15.69]) and 1.82 (95% CI [1.33, 2.50]), respectively. During the maintenance phase of extension trials, symptoms subsided with a subcutaneous 200 mg dose (RR = 1.46, 95% CI [0.47, 4.51], P = 0.51). To conclude, mirikizumab demonstrates significant efficacy in treating UC, substaintially improving clinical, endoscopic, and histological outcomes.",

    "abstract": "The role of endogenous sex hormones in the risk of endometrial cancer (EC) remains contradictory across the studies. This meta-analysis was carried out to investigate the relation of circulating concentrations of sex hormones and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) to EC risk. A search of the PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases was conducted to include relevant studies. We used odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) to pool effect sizes using a random effects model. The analysis included 16 studies with 292,695 participants. SHBG levels showed an inverse relationship with EC (OR: 0.67). In contrast, higher circulating levels of total testosterone (OR: 1.70), free testosterone (OR: 1.75), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (OR: 1.39), and androstenedione (OR: 1.58) were positively associated with EC risk. Estrogens also demonstrated significant associations, so that estrone (OR: 1.55), unconjugated estrone (OR: 1.86), estradiol (OR: 1.38), unconjugated estradiol (OR: 2.14), estriol (OR: 1.75), and unconjugated estriol (OR: 1.99) were linked to increased EC risk, while conjugated estrogens showed no significant associations. A non-linear dose-response relationship was found for SHBG, estrone, estradiol, and total testosterone. The results were significantly affected by age, cancer type, geographic region, menopausal status, study type, and the level of adjustments for covariates. For all hormones, the significant associations were found only for postmenopausal women. This study found an inverse association between SHBG and EC, while identified a direct relationship between sex hormones, except for conjugated estrogens, and EC risk only in postmenopausal women.",

    "abstract": "CAR T-cell therapy is effective in relapsed/refractory hematologic malignancies, but its use has been tempered by heterogeneity in response and safety outcomes. We performed individual patient data meta-analysis (IPDMA) of CAR T-cell therapy in patients with hematologic malignancies to explore whether patient-level factors modify therapeutic efficacy/safety. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane CENTRAL for relevant trials. IPD was collected and pooled from each included trial, and prevalence of outcomes among strata of potential modifiers was explored. Our primary outcome was complete response, and the secondary outcomes were cytokine release syndrome (CRS), and immune effector cell associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS). We identified 89 trials comprising 2,331 patients for the IPDMA. Complete response proportion ranged from 25% to 75% depending on cancer type. Decreased complete response was seen in those that received bridging therapy compared to those that did not (34% vs 58%, RR:0.55, 95% CI:0.30-0.98), as well as with autologous cell sources compared to allogeneic sources (53% vs 67%, RR:0.61, 95% CI:0.43-0.87). Compared to CAR T-cell therapies targeting CD19 alone, therapies that combine CD19 targeting with additional targets such as CD20, CD22, CD30, CD33, LeY, NKG2D, or BCMA were associated with higher complete response rates (72% vs 58%, RR:1.69, 95% CI:1.15-2.50). Autologous cell sources demonstrated increased risk of ICANS relative to allogeneic sources (24% vs 3%, RR:10.48, 95% CI:1.87-58.57). Safety and efficacy of CAR T-cell therapy within specific cancer types was also affected by modifiers including bridging therapy, CAR T-cell source, CAR T-cell target, sex, age, number of cell infusions, co-stimulatory domain, and dose.",

However, the dose-response effect and the strength of this effect are not entirely clear. We systematically searched and screened databases to include eligible studies. This study incorporates a random effect, as well as dose-response meta-analyses using a restricted cubic spline model. Forty randomized clinical trials were analyzed. Results demonstrated significant non-linear dose-response efficacy in the reduction of CRP concentration in patients with cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, and hypertension up to 1200 mg/day of EPA and DHA. In addition, there was a linear decrease in CRP concentration in the dyslipidemia population. The meta-analysis results did not show any significant reduction of CRP in overweight and obese participants, and the dose-response analysis failed to show any apparent reduction. In type 2 diabetes, pooling the results revealed a significant reduction in CRP; however, the combination of EPA and DHA failed to show significant dose-response efficacy in changing CRP concentration. 1200 mg/day of EPA and DHA may help to reduce CRP concentration in patients with cardiometabolic disorders. This reduction is clinically significant, and thus intervention with omega-3 fatty acids should be considered for this population.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this review was to evaluate the comparative efficacy of intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapy for neovascular AMD. We searched 12 literature databases for randomised clinical trials (RCT) on anti-VEGF therapy for neovascular AMD and extracted data on: change from baseline to 12 months in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and central retinal thickness (CRT), and cumulative number of injections at 12 months. The reference for comparison was monthly ranibizumab. Comparisons were made using network meta-analyses. Forty-nine RCTs including 23 257 eyes of 23 257 patients were included. No anti-VEGF drug or treatment regimen provided a better BCVA response compared to the reference. For CRT, small but statistically significant improvements over the reference were observed for brolucizumab 3 mg (-27.9 μm) or 6 mg (-38.1 μm) in loading dose (LD) then every 8-12 weeks, aflibercept 8 mg in LD then every 12 (-26.9 μm) or 16 weeks (-32.1 μm), faricimab 6 mg in LD then treat-and-extend (-18.1 μm) and aflibercept 2 mg in LD then every 8 weeks (-11.3 μm). For the cumulative number of injections, a range of anti-VEGF drugs and treatment regimens provided a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction compared to the reference. When results are considered simultaneously, faricimab 6.0 mg or aflibercept 8.0 mg in a treatment regimen with an LD followed by either a treat-and-extend regimen or a fixed 12- or 16-week regimen appears to provide the optimal balance between visual outcomes, anatomical outcomes and the lowest treatment burden.

In the present systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs), the impact of green tea on inflammatory and oxidative markers is investigated. Using pre-defined keywords, online databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science Core Collection, and Google Scholar) were searched for relevant articles, published from inception up to February 2024. The outcomes included C-reactive protein (CRP), tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GPX). Analyses of subgroups, linear, and non-linear associations were also carried out. Out of 1264 records initially retrieved, 38 RCTs were included. Supplementation with green tea improved the following indicators: IL-1β (weighted mean difference (WMD): -0.10 pg/mL; 95% CI: -0.15, -0.06), MDA (WMD: -0.40 mcmol/L; 95 % CI: -0.63, -0.18), TAC (WMD: 0.09 mmol/L; 95% CI: 0.05, 0.13), SOD (WMD: 17.21 u/L; 95% CI: 3.24, 31.19), and GPX (WMD: 3.90 u/L; 95% CI: 1.85, 5.95); but failed to improve others, including CRP (WMD: 0.01 mg/L; 95% CI: -0.14, 0.15), IL-6 (WMD: -0.34 pg/mL; 95% CI:-0.94, 0.26), and TNF-α (WMD: -0.07 pg/mL; 95% CI: -0.42, 0.28).

    "abstract": "Resveratrol, a natural polyphenol compound, possesses anti-aging, antitumor, and vascular protective properties. These attributes are believed to stem from its influence on Sirtuin 1 (Sirt1), a member of the human Sirtuin family and a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-dependent histone deacetylase. The aim of this study was to quantitatively investigate the impact of resveratrol supplementation on Sirt1 levels in adults by conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving resveratrol supplementation. This Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation-assessed systematic review involved a comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Google Scholar databases using related keywords and was conducted from March 14, 2024, to April 15, 2024, to identify all RCTs investigating resveratrol's effects on Sirt1. Effect sizes were quantified as mean differences (MDs) or standardized mean differences (SMDs), with standard deviations of outcomes. An overall effect estimate was derived using a random-effects model when 2 or more studies reported similar outcomes. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed through the calculation of I Eleven RCTs examining the effects of resveratrol on Sirt1 gene expression (4 RCTs), protein expression (5 RCTs), and serum levels (3 RCTs) were included in the meta-analysis. The results showed no significant impact of resveratrol on Sirt1 gene expression (SMD = 0.05; 95% CI -0.24 to 0.344; P = .73), protein expression (SMD = 0.3; 95% CI -0.15 to 0.77; P = .18), or serum levels (MD = -0.04; 95% CI -0.235 to 0.16; P = .7). However, subgroup analyses suggested a significant increase in Sirt1 gene expression in studies with an intervention duration of <12 weeks and evaluating blood tissue. Furthermore, the impact of resveratrol on Sirt1 appeared to be influenced by the dosage regimen, with a significant effect for intervention duration. Study results indicate that resveratrol supplementation does not significantly influence human Sirt1 based on the overall meta-analysis. However, the dose-response analysis suggests that the effect of resveratrol on Sirt1 depends on the dosage regimen.",

    "title": "Evaluating comparative effectiveness of pembrolizumab-based therapy versus chemotherapy in treatment of gastric carcinoma: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.",
    "abstract": "Gastric cancer, especially cancer of the gastro-esophageal junction, ranks among the first five cancers in the world with the highest mortality rates. It has poor survival rates for the advanced stages. Traditional chemotherapy, while standard, often results in significant side effects and limited efficacy. The objective of this meta-analysis and systemic review is to ascertain if pembrolizumab-based therapies for advanced gastric cancer are more effective and safer than standard chemotherapy. The focus consisted of RCTs with adults suffering from gastric carcinoma who received pembrolizumab every 3 weeks (200 mg) intra-related dose or with at least comparable chemotherapy regimen. Outcomes assessed are as follows: overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and objective response rate (ORR). All potential sources regarding the search of outcome measures were applied: Google Scholar, Scopus, PubMed, and Cochrane library, and last search in June 2024 was carried out. Out of 568 articles screened, four RCTs comprising 2,831 patients met the inclusion criteria. Analysis indicated that pembrolizumab alone did not significantly improve OS compared to chemotherapy (HR 0.87). However, when combined with chemotherapy, pembrolizumab dramatically enhanced OS (HR 0.80) and PFS (HR 0.78). ORR was superior in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group (RR 1.24), while pembrolizumab monotherapy showed no significant difference from chemotherapy alone. Safety analysis revealed a higher frequency of adverse events in the pembrolizumab-based therapy groups compared to chemotherapy. Pembrolizumab together with chemotherapy improves greater survival and higher levels of response rate in patients with severe gastric cancer, especially with high PD-L1 expression. But it has rather more adverse events, allowing patient monitoring with care.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to identify the optimal strategy for patients with autoimmune diseases by comparing the immunoreaction and effectiveness of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines between healthy individuals and patients. The PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library were searched for eligible studies on effectiveness and immunoreaction to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in patients with autoimmune diseases published until October 07, 2022. The quality of each included study was evaluated by independent reviewers using National Institutes of Health study quality assessment tool, and the STATA 15.0 software was used for all statistical analyses. A total of 84 publications were included and analyzed in this meta-analysis, favoring healthy controls regarding serological response (risk ratio, RR=0.88, 95% CI (confidence interval): 0.86-0.91), antibody response (RR=0.90, 95%CI: 0.87-0.94), and incidence of seropositive immunoglobulin G (IgG) (RR=0.74, 95%CI: 0.69-0.80) than patients post-vaccination. Patients with autoimmune diseases developed lower IgG (standard mean difference, SMD=-0.64 95%CI: -0.84 to -0.43) and antibody titer level (SMD=-1.39, 95%CI: -2.30 to -0.49) than healthy individuals in AU/ml. Stratified analyses were conducted further according to various potential factors in full-text studies. Patients who are immunocompromised and received more vaccines demonstrated poorer humoral responses and seropositive incidence after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination than healthy individuals. Despite the lack of observable favor for patients with autoimmune diseases, the trend of effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines is close to that for healthy populations. Patients who are immunocompromised should be provided a better SARS-CoV-2 vaccination schedule, considering various vaccine subtypes, dose(s), variants of concern, and immunoassays.",

    "title": "Unveiling the efficacy and safety of Erenumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor, in patients with chronic and episodic migraine: a GRADE-assessed systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials with subgroup analysis.",
    "abstract": "Migraine is a highly prevalent and disabling disease, affecting nearly 14% of the global population. Preventive medications involve drugs like beta-adrenergic blockers, antidepressants, and anticonvulsants. However, these drugs lacked effectiveness, and patients showed poor tolerance and low adherence to them. Erenumab, a calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor blocker, has recently shown promising results in migraine management. In this meta-analysis, the efficacy of Erenumab is investigated by employing a subgroup analysis approach. We conducted a systematic search of six electronic databases until July 2024. Review Manager 5.4 software was utilized for the analysis, based on either weighted mean difference (MD) and standard deviation (SD) for continuous outcomes or risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes, with a confidence interval (CI) of 95%. A P-value < 0.05 indicated statistical significance. The study was registered on PROSPERO with registration number CRD42024573300. Additionally, we conducted subgroup analyses and assessed the quality of evidence using GRADE. A total of 20 randomized controlled trials (n = 5212) were included in our analysis. At three months, Erenumab showed statistically significant improvements in monthly migraine days (MMD), monthly acute migraine-specific medication days (MSMD), Headache Impact Test (HIT-6) score, and ≥ 50% reduction from baseline in MMD (MD: -1.78, 95% CI: [-2.37 to -1.20], P < 0.00001), (MD: -1.36, 95% CI: [-1.92 to -0.81], P < 0.00001), (MD: -2.83, 95% CI: [-3.83 to -1.82], P < 0.00001), and (RR: 1.52, 95% CI: [1.31 to 1.76], P < 0.00001), respectively. Subgroup analysis revealed that Erenumab was significantly more effective in patients with prior preventive treatment failures compared to patients with no prior failure. No significant difference in Erenumab`s response existed between episodic and chronic migraine or between 140 and 70 mg, except for MSMD in dose subgrouping. Only constipation emerged as a significant adverse effect in the Erenumab group. This meta-analysis found that Erenumab significantly reduced migraine attack frequency, medication days, and physical impairment. It was more effective for patients with prior treatment failures. The 140 mg dose showed better MSMD reduction than 70 mg. Erenumab's safety profile was similar to that of placebo, with only constipation noted as significant.",

    "title": "Comparative efficacy and safety of low-dose versus high-dose bevacizumab in ovarian cancer: An indirect treatment comparison.",
    "abstract": "First-line therapy for ovarian cancer involves cytoreductive surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy, with or without bevacizumab. Bevacizumab can be administered at low (7.5 mg/kg every three weeks [Q3W]) or high dose (15 mg/kg Q3W). This study compared the efficacy and safety of these dosing strategies. Systematic literature review of Embase, MEDLINE®, and CENTRAL (18/09/2023) identified randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating bevacizumab versus any therapy or control in ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. Indirect treatment comparisons (ITC) of response, survival, and safety outcomes were performed, including sensitivity/subgroup analyses adjusting for heterogeneity. Six RCTs (sample size: 24-1528 patients) were included for ITC. Five evaluated high-dose bevacizumab with chemotherapy. The common comparator was carboplatin + paclitaxel. Trials mainly included stage III (n = 4) or stage II-III (n = 1) ovarian cancer patients; one did not report cancer stage. Primary analyses showed no significant differences between low- versus high-dose bevacizumab for partial response (risk ratio [95 % confidence interval]: 0.66 [0.42, 1.02]), complete response (1.76 [0.76, 4.11]), objective response rate (1.01 [0.63, 1.61]), progressive disease (1.08 [0.38, 3.10]), clinical benefit (0.89 [0.76, 1.03]), any grade ≥ 3 adverse event (1.53 [0.96, 2.44]), specific grade ≥ 3 adverse events, overall survival (hazard ratio: 0.93 [0.77, 1.13]), or progression-free survival (1.02 [0.86, 1.22]). Sensitivity and subgroup analyses confirmed findings. This ITC found no significant difference in clinical outcomes between low- and high-dose bevacizumab combination therapy. Despite limitations of small sample size and heterogeneities, findings suggest that bevacizumab dose may not significantly impact ovarian cancer outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Rituximab (RTX) is one of the treatment options for refractory myasthenia gravis (MG), yet the optimal dosing schedule remains undetermined. Our study aims to explore this issue and offer a valuable reference for clinical dosing. This is a single-arm meta-analysis. Studies in adults with myasthenia gravis published before 31 December 2023 were searched in PubMed, Web of Science, and other databases. Two primary effectiveness outcomes were analyzed: (1) Proportion of patients achieving minimal manifestation status (MMS) or better, (2) Change in Quantitative MG Score (QMGs) after RTX treatment. Safety outcomes included the incidence and description of serious adverse events (SAEs) and adverse events (AEs). Forest plots were generated to provide an overview and detailed combined effects. Publication bias was evaluated using funnel plots and the Egger test. Conventional dose refers to an RTX regimen similar to that used for the treatment of B-cell lymphoma: 375 mg/m A total of 1037 MG patients received RTX treatment. Overall, 59.0% (95% CI: 48.2-69.8%, n = 599) of patients achieved MMS or better, with a mean decrease in QMGs of 6.81 (95% CI, -9.27 to -4.35, n = 222). The low-dose group showed a higher proportion of patients achieving MMS or better (76.6% vs 51.6%) and a more significant decrease in QMGs from baseline (-9.04 vs -3.62) compared to the conventional dose group (P < 0.01). Differences in the incidence of SAEs and AEs between the two groups were not significant (P > 0.05). Univariate meta-regression analyses showed that the dose administered was significantly associated with the proportion of MMS or better and the change in QMGs, whereas the proportion of Musk patients was not significantly associated with any of the outcomes. Stepwise logistic regression analyses showed that non-refractory MG, mild disease severity (MGFA classification), and low-dose were significant predictors for achieving an MMS or better prognosis, whereas for achieving improvement or better, only low dose was an independent predictor. RTX can improve clinical symptoms, reduce QMGs in MG patients and the use of oral glucocorticoids and other immunosuppressants. The efficacy of low-dose RTX in treating MG patients is more effective than conventional-dose RTX and demonstrates a better safety profile. Mild disease severity, non-refractory MG, low dose, and MuSK-MG over AChR-MG predict better efficacy. Large randomized controlled trials are necessary to evaluate the efficacy and safety of RTX in MG patients and its various subtypes.",

    "abstract": "This comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the impact of sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) supplementation on cardiovascular disease risk factors. Relevant research was discovered via PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, CENTRAL, and EMBASE up to June 2024. The assessment of study quality was conducted using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. Thirteen trials, with interventions ranging from 4 to 12 weeks and involving 521 participants, demonstrated significant reductions in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) (Standardized Mean Difference [SMD] = - 0.67; 95% Confidence Interval [CI] - 1.01, - 0.32; P < 0.001), C-reactive protein (CRP) (SMD = - 0.51; 95% CI - 0.96, - 0.05; P = 0.028), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) (SMD = - 0.74; 95% CI - 1.16, - 0.32; P < 0.001), and a marginally significant effect on fasting blood sugar (FBS) (SMD = - 0.57; 95% CI - 1.16, 0.02; P = 0.057). Subgroup analyses revealed that sesame supplementation significantly reduced CRP and malondialdehyde (MDA) in populations without chronic diseases, while total cholesterol (TC) and MDA were reduced in those with chronic diseases. MDA was significantly reduced in females, especially those aged 50 or older. At dosages of 10 g per day or less, CRP, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), and TC showed significant improvements. Meta-regression highlighted a significant dose-dependent reduction in TC levels at 10 g/day, and a significant duration-dependent decrease in TG levels at 8 weeks of supplementation. Sesame supplementation demonstrates potential benefits in improving glycemic control, inflammatory markers, and lipid profiles, making it a promising adjunct therapy for reducing cardiovascular disease risk factors.",

    "abstract": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are a promising class of targeted cancer therapies. However, they need careful dose optimization to maximize effectiveness and minimize side effects. Sometimes, safety issues may only become apparent after approval, so ongoing evaluation is important. This study aimed to assess the benefit-risk profiles of two approved trastuzumab-drug conjugates: trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) and trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd). A systematic search of MEDLINE on May 1, 2024, identified clinical trials reporting the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, and efficacy of T-DM1 and T-DXd. Summary-level data from 103 trials was used along with model-based meta-analysis to develop population pharmacokinetic and exposure-response models for both ADCs. The study combined the objective response rate (ORR) and dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) into a composite score called the clinical utility index (CUI) to determine optimal drug exposures and doses that maximize the benefit-risk balance. Different ORR/DLT weights and CUI thresholds representing desired minimum effect size were tested in three scenarios (\"only phase I trials,\" \"phase I/II trials,\" and \"all phases\"). Using a CUI threshold of 10%, the approved T-DM1 dose of 3.6 mg/kg for breast cancer was found to align with an efficacy-safety (ORR-DLT) ratio of 81:19 with all phases. Applying these weights to the T-DXd analyses successfully predicted the approved T-DXd dose (5.4 mg/kg, breast cancer), showing a CUI improvement compared to the 3.2 mg/kg dose of 8.3%, 8.2%, and 2.4% in the three respective scenarios. Overall, this proof-of-concept assessment of ADCs can save time and costs for pharmaceutical companies and optimize dosing to maximize patient benefit.",

    "title": "From wheal to wellness: efficacy and safety of ligelizumab in chronic spontaneous urticaria: a systematic review and meta-analysis.",
    "abstract": "Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is characterized by persistent hives and itching that lasts longer than six weeks. Ligelizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody specifically targeting IgE, has emerged as a promising option for managing CSU. This study evaluates the effectiveness and safety of ligelizumab for this debilitating condition. A comprehensive literature search was conducted at PubMed, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, and ClinicalTrials.gov to identify relevant studies published until December 2024. The review included randomized controlled trials that compared ligelizumab with a placebo. Our meta-analysis of 2581 patients found that ligelizumab significantly improves outcomes in chronic spontaneous urticaria. A dose-dependent response was observed, with 24 mg being non-superior to placebo. Doses of 72 mg significantly reduced Itch Severity Score (MD: - 3.54; 95% CI - 4.36 to - 2.73; P < 0.00001), Urticaria Activity Score (UAS7) (MD: - 9.79; 95% CI - 10.65 to - 8.93; P < 0.00001),  provided complete UAS7 response (UAS7 = 0) (OR: 7.30; 95% CI 2.99 to 17.83; P < 0.0001), and Angioedema free weeks (MD: 2.22; 95% CI 1.63 to 2.82; P < 0.00001), with further improvements noted at the 120 mg dose. Statistically significant results were also observed for the Dermatological Life Quality Index and Hives Severity Score. No significant adverse effects were reported with ligelizumab 72 mg, but very mild adverse effects were discovered with the 120 mg dose. Ligelizumab, at doses of 72 mg and 120 mg, effectively manages CSU by reducing symptoms and improving overall quality of life compared to placebo, although 120 mg Ligelizumab is associated with mild Adverse Events.",

    "title": "Assessing the efficacy of infliximab in promoting vascular and mucosal healing in immunoglobulin-resistant kawasaki disease: a meta-analysis.",
    "abstract": "This meta-analysis investigates the efficacy of infliximab in reducing vascular damage, suppressing inflammation, and promoting mucosal healing in patients with immunoglobulin-resistant Kawasaki Disease (KD). A systematic literature search was conducted in line with PRISMA guidelines across databases (e.g., PubMed, Google Scholar) for studies published between, 2003-2023. While high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin remains the standard treatment for KD, a subset of patients exhibit resistance, necessitating alternative therapeutic strategies. Infliximab, a monoclonal antibody that targets tumor necrosis factor-alpha, presents a promising option for these challenging cases. By modulating the immune response and suppressing inflammation, Infliximab has the potential to alleviate vascular damage and enhance mucosal healing in patients unresponsive to conventional treatments. This study specifically focuses on the impact of Infliximab on healing of vascular damage, as indicated by clinical remission, mucosal healing, and changes in absolute neutrophil counts-a key marker of inflammation. Employing a proportional meta-analysis via the 'metafor' function in R, we analyzed data from 857 patients, including 403 events related to mucosal and vascular healing outcomes. Our findings reveal a significant improvement in these healing processes among KD patients treated with Infliximab (Proportion: 0.45, 95% CI: [0.42; 0.48], I² = 87%, p < 0.01), accompanied by a notable reduction in inflammation as evidenced by decreased absolute neutrophil counts (mean difference: 7.67). These results underscore the potential of Infliximab and similar biologic therapies to effectively address the unmet needs of patients with immunoglobulin-resistant KD, offering a viable pathway to mitigate inflammation and enhance mucosal and vascular healing outcomes.",

    "title": "A dose-response meta-analysis of grape by-product effects on lamb growth performance, nutrient digestibility, and blood parameters.",
    "abstract": "Previous studies on feeding grape by-products (GBP) to lambs have shown conflicting results regarding performance, nutrient digestibility, nitrogen metabolism, and blood constituents. To clarify these uncertainties, we conducted a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and dose-dependent effects of GBP in lamb diets. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of the results, including the localisation of knots, leave-one-out tests and the exclusion of data points with high GBP addition (more than 600 g/kg). The results showed that GBP addition had no statistically significant effect on DMI (P = 0.92), average daily gain (P = 0.21) or final live weight (P = 0.36). However, GBP inclusion had a significant effect on feed conversion ratio (P = 0.002), with lambs fed up to 450 g/kg GBP showing an improved feed conversion ratio, which peaked at 200 g/kg. ADF digestibility was not significantly affected by GBP inclusion (P = 0.08). Conversely, significant negative linear correlations were observed between the consumption of GBP and the digestibility of OM (P = 0.03), CP (P = 0.002), DM (P = 0.001) and NDF (P = 0.004). In contrast, the intake of GBP was positively associated with fat digestibility (P = 0.001). The meta-analysis revealed no significant association between GBP intake and urinary nitrogen excretion, nitrogen consumed, faecal nitrogen excretion, or nitrogen retained. Blood analysis also showed no significant correlation between GBP consumption and serum concentrations of albumin, cholesterol, glucose, triglycerides, or total protein. However, blood urea nitrogen concentration showed a significant non-linear, J-shaped relationship with GBP consumption (P = 0.001), decreasing with GBP inclusion up to 250 g/kg DM, with no significant changes at higher levels. No statistically significant effects of GBP on serum AST (P = 0.28) or GGT (P = 0.93) were observed. In contrast, GBP intake of up to 200 g/kg DM significantly reduced ALT activity in serum (P = 0.009). In conclusion, the intake of GBP shows a dose-dependent response that affects nutrient digestibility and may influence feed efficiency and health status of lambs. Intake of GBP in the range of 200-400 g/kg DM can improve feed conversion ratio and health but can also reduce the digestibility of certain feed components such as OM, DM, CP and NDF.",

    "title": "Optimal dose and duration of iron supplementation for treating iron deficiency anaemia in children and adolescents: A systematic review and meta-analysis.",
    "abstract": "Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) accounts for nearly two-thirds of all anaemia cases globally. Despite the widespread use of iron supplementation, the optimal dose and duration for treating IDA remain unclear. In this study, we aimed to determine the most effective dose and duration of iron supplementation for improving haemoglobin (Hb) levels in children and adolescents (≤19 years) with IDA. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library for peer-reviewed studies published between 2013 and 2024. The interventions included iron supplementation with a defined dose and duration of at least 30 days. Comparators were placebo, no treatment, or alternative regimens. The outcome was the change in Hb levels. Eligible studies included IDA cases diagnosed through ferritin level measurements in healthy individuals. Studies involving pregnant women or children with underlying conditions were excluded. A meta-analysis was performed using standardized mean differences to pool effect sizes for Hb improvement with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Subgroup analyses were performed for different treatment durations (<3 months, 3-6 months, >6 months) and dosage categories (<5 mg/kg/day, 5-10 mg/kg/day, >10 mg/kg/day). A random-effects meta-regression model was used to determine the optimal dose and duration, accounting for known covariates affecting Hb improvement. A total of 28 studies with 8,829 participants from 16 countries were included. The pooled effect size for Hb improvement was 2.01 gm/dL (95% CI: 1.48-2.54, p < 0.001). Iron supplementation for less than 3 months showed the highest significant effect size (2.39 gm/dL, 95% CI: 0.72-4.07), followed by treatments exceeding 6 months (1.93 gm/dL, 95% CI: 0.09-3.77). The lowest effect size was observed in treatments lasting 3-6 months (1.58 gm/dL, 95% CI: 0.93-2.23). Low-dose iron supplementation (<5 mg/kg/day) demonstrated favourable trends in Hb improvement, particularly in individuals with lower baseline Hb levels. Oral ferrous sulphate had a significant effect (2.03 gm/dL, 95% CI: 1.24-2.82), while parenteral ferric Carboxymaltose showed consistent efficacy. Low-dose iron supplementation (<5 mg/kg/day) combined with treatment durations of either less than 3 months or more than 6 months, is optimal for improving Hb levels in children and adolescents with IDA. Tailoring treatment based on baseline Hb levels and anaemia severity is essential. These findings provide evidence to support updated guidelines on iron supplementation in paediatric and adolescent populations and inform national anaemia management programmes. Prospero registration number: This study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42024541773).",

    "abstract": "Some evidence suggests magnesium might reduce serum levels of lipid profile. Due to the significance of this matter on hand, we centralized our aim to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to interrogate the effect of magnesium supplementation on serum levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in the general population aged ≥ 18 years. In line with conducting this study first, relevant articles were found through searching databases, including five databases: Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, ISI Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed until January 2024. Following fulfilling the first aim, their mean differences and standard deviations were calculated to conduct the meta-analysis. Ultimately, an assessment of the statistical heterogeneity of intervention effects was performed using I-squared statistics and Cochran's Q test. Regarding serum levels of TC, TG, LDL-C, and HDL-C, twenty-one, twenty-three, twenty, and twenty-five studies were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled estimates showed no significant differences in serum levels of TC, TG, and LDL-C between the magnesium group and comparison group (weighted mean difference (WMD) = 0.34 mg/dl, 95% confidence interval (CI): -1.75 to 2.43, P = 0.749, I In conclusion, our study showed that magnesium significantly increased HDL-C levels. However, due to high heterogeneity, we must note that more research is needed to make robust recommendations regarding magnesium supplementation in clinical practice.

    "abstract": "During menopause, women experience a range of physiological changes, including reduction in skeletal muscle mass, bone mineral density, and an increase in fat mass. Although strength training and dietary strategies have individually been shown to counteract these changes, evidence for their combined effects is currently lacking. This review aims to investigate the combinatory effects on body composition, muscle strength, and bone mineral density. Three databases (PUBMED, Web of Science, and SPORTDiscus) were screened following the PRISMA guidelines. The PEDro scale was utilized to evaluate methodological quality and potential bias risk. The analyzed outcome parameters were body composition, muscle strength, and bone mineral density. A total of 34 studies including postmenopausal women ( Systematic strength training has been consistently demonstrated to improve body composition, strength capacity, and bone mineral density. However, the evidence supporting the effectiveness of additional nutritional and supplementation strategies remains inconclusive. While a calorie-restricted diet and adequate protein intake appear to promote favourable changes in body composition, the available data is still insufficient to derive specific and evidence-based recommendations regarding supplementation in conjunction with strength training. Moreover, research on additional nutritional and supplementation strategies remains inconsistent or scarce, underscoring the need for further studies to allow for more precise recommendations.

    "title": "Performance Optimization in Streetlifting: The Combined Role of Nutrition, Lean Mass, and Sleep.",
    "abstract": "Streetlifting is a developing strength sport derived from calisthenics and based on maximal external load performance in weighted pull-ups, dips, muscle-ups, and squat variations. Its rapid global expansion has raised interest in identifying sport-specific nutritional and recovery strategies that can support performance and health. However, scientific evidence directly focused on streetlifting remains limited. This narrative review aims to summarize current knowledge regarding body composition, nutrition, supplementation, and sleep in streetlifting athletes by integrating findings from related strength sports. A narrative review design was adopted due to the scarcity of empirical studies on streetlifting. Searches were performed using the terms \"streetlifting AND nutrition,\" \"streetlifting AND body composition,\" and \"streetlifting AND sleep quality.\" Peer-reviewed studies involving comparable strength disciplines were included when directly applicable to performance or recovery determinants. Performance in streetlifting appears strongly driven by strength-to-bodyweight ratio, supported by low-to-moderate fat mass and adequate lean mass. Evidence from resistance training literature suggests that meeting energy requirements, consuming 1.2-1.5 g/kg/day of protein, and using nutrient timing around training may enhance muscle protein synthesis and glycogen replenishment. Creatine supplementation shows consistent benefits for maximal strength and ATP turnover, whereas other supplements lack robust evidence. Sleep duration and quality contribute to neuromuscular recovery, endocrine balance, and cognitive readiness, though sport-specific findings are insufficient. Streetlifting athletes may benefit from integrated nutritional planning, evidence-based supplementation, and sleep optimization. Further sport-specific interventional and longitudinal studies are required to develop validated performance and health guidelines.",

    "abstract": "Supplementation with recombinant bovine β-lactoglobulin (rBLG), a precision-engineered mimetic of dairy-derived whey, supports similar resistance exercise (RE) training-induced muscle remodeling to whey protein (WHEY). However, the influence of rBLG on recovery indices and muscle protein synthesis rates after damaging exercise is unknown. In a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group design, 27 healthy adults consuming a controlled diet (∼0.9 g/kg body mass/d of protein) were supplemented thrice daily with 0.3 g/kg body mass of rBLG, WHEY, or isocaloric carbohydrate placebo for 3 d following an acute bout of damaging lower-body RE (8 × 10 maximal, unilateral, eccentric knee extensions). Consumption of deuterated water combined with serial vastus lateralis muscle biopsies permitted the measurement of integrated myofibrillar protein synthesis (iMyoPS) >72 h before (habitual) and after RE. Knee extensor maximum voluntary contraction (MVC), muscle soreness, and plasma concentrations of creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were also assessed post-RE to characterize muscle recovery. iMyoPS fractional synthetic rate (%/d) increased following damaging RE (P < 0.001), with no significant differences between groups. Knee extensor MVC decreased, and subjective muscle soreness and plasma LDH concentrations increased following strenuous exercise (P < 0.05 for all) with no significant differences between groups. At habitual dietary protein intakes ∼0.9 g/kg body mass/d, further rBLG or WHEY supplementation did not influence muscle recovery or iMyoPS rates, suggesting that protein supplementation, at the intakes studied, may have limited efficacy as a tool to enhance muscle recovery and remodeling from damaging exercise.",

    "abstract": "This review examines the impact of incretin-based therapies and related incretin therapies on skeletal muscle health during pharmacologic weight loss. It explores the extent to which lean mass reduction contributes to total weight loss and highlights strategies to preserve muscle as a determinant of cardiovascular resilience. Emerging data indicate that 25-40% of incretin-based therapies-induced weight loss derives from loss of lean mass, with skeletal muscle being a key component. Although incretin-based therapies may improve the quality of skeletal muscle by reducing muscle fat infiltration, its function and strength remain underexplored. Exercise, adequate protein intake, and creatine supplementation mitigate these effects, whereas novel adjuncts such as myostatin/activin inhibitors and selective androgen receptor modulators show promise in early trials. Preserving muscle during incretin-based pharmacotherapy weight reduction is key to sustain long-term metabolic and cardiovascular benefits. Future trials should assess body composition, functional outcomes, and integrate muscle-preserving co-therapies into obesity management.",

    "abstract": "Sarcopenia is an age-related decline in muscle strength and mass, which significantly impacts the quality of life for older adults. Resistance training (RT) is well established as an effective intervention for sarcopenia. Some studies suggest that additional benefits may be obtained when RT is combined with creatine supplement (Cr). However, critical confounding factors, such as age and intervention duration, have not been systematically controlled in previous investigations. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to quantify the efficacy of Cr + RT on appendicular muscle strength and lean tissue mass in older adults, with a particular emphasis on temporal effect modification through duration-stratified subgroup analyses. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) through searches across eight databases. Eligible studies involved aged individuals undergoing resistance training (2–3 sessions/week) with Cr or placebo (PL) for 8-104 weeks. After screening, 8 RCTs ( Compared to PL + RT, Cr + RT significantly improved lower limb strength (SMD = 0.29 [95% CI 0.00-0.57];  Cr + RT can significantly increase muscle strength and lean tissue mass in older adults, particularly in interventions lasting up to 32 weeks. These time-dependent effects highlight the importance of intervention duration in nutritional ergogenic strategies for sarcopenia management.  This systematic review has the registration number CRD420251018405 on PROSPERO.

    "abstract": "Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a common joint disorder and a leading cause of disability. Although there is no cure, management strategies focus on conservative approaches such as pharmacotherapy, nonpharmacological supplementation, physical therapy (PT), and exercise. Pharmacological treatments are widely used for pain relief but carry risks of long-term adverse effects and do not enhance joint or muscle health. Nonpharmacological supplements, including glucosamine and chondroitin-sulphate, are frequently used, although their effectiveness remains debated. However, PT, particularly resistance training (RT), has shown significant benefits in improving muscle strength and function in KOA. Creatine supplementation (CS) has recently emerged as a promising non-pharmacological intervention, particularly when combined with RT. Studies indicate that while CS alone shows limited benefits in KOA, its combination with RT significantly enhances muscle strength, lean mass, physical function, and quality of life by replenishing phosphocreatine stores, which fuel high-intensity muscle contractions during RT. Additionally, CS appears to be safe in short and mid-term use according to the available studies. Even though evidence has shown positive effects of CS without any significant adverse effects, very few studies with small sample sizes have been published in the literature regarding KOA, reporting varying results. We recommend that future studies should include larger sample sizes and standardized measures to strengthen the evidence base.",

    "abstract": "Sarcopenia is a major contributor to frailty and functional decline among older adults. Combining exercise with nutritional strategies such as creatine monohydrate (CRE) and β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate (HMB) supplementation may help to preserve strength and independence. To evaluate the effects of 6-week CRE + HMB supplementation combined with an integral physical conditioning (IPC) program on functional strength and body composition in physically active older adults. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial, 30 older adults (20 men, 10 women; ≥ 60 years) completed two 6-week intervention periods (CRE + HMB or placebo) separated by a 3-week washout. The IPC program performed in both conditions consisted of four supervised weekly sessions combining strength, power, multicomponent circuits, high-intensity interval and moderate intensity continuous training), performed at 40-100% training heart rate (THR) and 20-90% one-repetition maximum (1RM) and structured as warm-up, main part and cooldown. Functional strength and body composition (bioelectrical impedance analysis) were assessed pre- and post-intervention, respectively. Significant time × group interactions were observed for fat mass, fat-free mass, total muscle mass, skeletal muscle mass, appendicular skeletal muscle mass, muscle mass index, skeletal muscle index and ALM/BMI (all p < 0.05). The CRE + HMB group showed reductions in fat mass and body fat percentage, with slight numerical increases in muscle parameters, whereas the placebo group exhibited opposite trends. However, within-group changes were not statistically significant. In contrast, CRE + HMB significantly improved multiple functional strength outcomes, including leg/back strength, arm flexion strength, upper-body endurance (dumbbell flexion, push-ups, isometric hold) and core endurance (crunches). Regression analyses suggested that these improvements were largely independent of changes in muscle mass, supporting a potential neuromuscular mechanism. Six weeks of CRE + HMB supplementation combined with IPC enhanced functional strength and endurance in active older adults, largely independent of changes in muscle mass. This combined approach represents a promising strategy for preserving functional capacity and promoting healthy ageing.",

    "abstract": "Arsenic (As) contamination of groundwater in some parts of Bangladesh has become a major threat to human health. Chronic exposure to As leads to anxiety development, memory impairment, and muscle weakness in humans and experimental animals. Panax ginseng (PG) is an herb utilized for multiple health-related applications. Furthermore, regular exercise (Ex) can reduce the risk of various diseases, and is also effective against heavy metal-associated neurotoxicity. Swiss albino mice were divided into five groups (n = 6) to evaluate the protective effects of Ex and PG (50 mg/kg body weight) supplementation against As-induced (10 mg/kg body weight) muscular weakness and neurobehavioral Changes for 60 days. Mice exposed to As showed weaker muscular strength, impaired memory and increased anxiety-like behavior along with the alteration of biochemical parameters related muscular weakness and neurobehavioral changes compared to control mice. However, As + Ex + PG-exposed mice showed significantly (p < 0.05) better performances in all behavioral tests compared to mice exposed to As alone. Additionally, compared to As-exposed mice, As + Ex + PG-exposed mice showed significantly improved (p < 0.05) activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and reduced glutathione reductase (rGR) in brain, while serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase (CK) were reduced. Furthermore, levels of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor-2 (Nrf2), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and interleukin-10 (IL-10) levels were increased, while interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels were decreased in brain tissue of As + Ex + PG-exposed mice compared to As-exposed mice. The results of this study suggest that Ex with PG supplementation can attenuate As-induced muscle weakness, cognitive disorder and anxiety development, possibly through the up-regulation of the Nrf2-HO-1 pathway in the As-exposure mice.",

    "title": "Creatine and Cognition in Aging: A Systematic Review of Evidence in Older Adults.",
    "abstract": "Creatine is a well-studied dietary supplement that is known to benefit aging muscle and bone, especially when combined with resistance training. Some studies suggest that creatine may also be favorable for cognitive function, yet these independent effects have not been thoroughly reviewed in older adults. The objective of this study was to systematically examine the current literature on creatine and cognition in older adults. A comprehensive search was conducted across eight electronic databases. Original peer-reviewed studies investigating creatine supplementation and/or estimations of dietary creatine intake in older adults (aged 55+ years) with cognition assessed as an outcome were included. Studies not examining creatine and cognition exclusively, only in combination with another intervention (e.g., resistance training), were excluded. The methodological quality of each study was evaluated using a modified version of the Downs and Black (1998) checklist. Six studies were included, with a total of 1542 participants (55.7% female). Most participant samples included healthy community-dwelling older adults, with the exception of one study examining overweight older women. Two studies were double-blind interventions in which participants were supplemented with creatine monohydrate. Four studies were cross-sectional and estimated creatine consumption through dietary recall. Five of the six (83.3%) studies reported a positive relationship between creatine and cognition in older adults, particularly in the domains of memory and attention. One study achieved a methodological quality rating of \"good\", two \"fair\", and three \"poor\". The current limited evidence suggests that creatine may be associated with benefits for cognition in generally healthy older adults. However, high-quality clinical trials are warranted to further validate this relationship. Future research should investigate creatine supplementation in older clinical populations with notable cognitive deficits, objectively measure creatine concentrations, and consider additional factors that may influence creatine levels in the body and brain (e.g., body weight, muscle mass, dietary intake, physical activity levels).

    "abstract": "We discuss the premise and potential of multi-ingredient supplements (MIS) in the treatment of complex skeletal muscle (SkM) pathologies, and provide an updated review of literature on nutraceuticals in sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity (SO) management, with an emphasis on single- vs. multi-ingredient protein-based formulations. Several meta-analyses have confirmed the synergistic benefits of combining resistance training (RT) with dietary protein supplementation in older adults with sarcopenia or physical frailty, with a potential ceiling effect at 1.5-1.7 g PRO/kg BW/day.Single-ingredient supplements with proven synergism with RT and clinical relevance for sarcopenia treatment include the major milk proteins (whey and/or casein) and creatine monohydrate. Vitamin D 3 , calcium, and/or n -3 polyunsaturated fatty acids are also recommended for mitigating concurrent micronutrient deficiencies, bone loss, and inflammation. More evidence is needed to justify monotherapy with leucine or leucine metabolites over high-quality protein sources.RCTs have demonstrated superiority of whey-based MIS compared to isocaloric and isonitrogenous placebo for enhancing SkM growth in both younger and older persons, including obese and nonobese sarcopenic subgroups, as confirmed by in vivo body composition and/or biopsy sampling.Multi-ingredient formulations containing high-quality milk proteins, creatine monohydrate, vitamin D 3 , calcium, and n -3 polyunsaturated fatty acids may therefore be recommended in the multimodal treatment of sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity. Resistance training is the first-line treatment for musculoskeletal conditions and improves lean body mass, strength, and function in sarcopenia patients. Increased protein intake augments RT-induced muscle anabolism across clinical subpopulations, with recent evidence suggesting superiority of multi vs. single-ingredient protein-based supplements.",

This review examines the bidirectional relationship between T2D and sarcopenia, and synthesizes current evidence on how skeletal muscle deterioration and insulin resistance interact to disrupt glucose homeostasis. We summarize molecular mechanisms by which physical exercise enhances glucose uptake via insulin-dependent and insulin-independent pathways, and review the ergogenic and metabolic effects of creatine monohydrate (CrM). We also evaluate studies combining CrM supplementation with resistance or aerobic training and their effects on glycaemic control, muscle mass and function. Overall, combined exercise and creatine supplementation show potential to improve glucose regulation and attenuate muscle loss in older adults and people with T2D. Available data indicate that CrM is well tolerated in healthy and clinical populations when used at recommended doses, with no consistent evidence of adverse renal or hepatic effects. Further large randomized trials are needed to define optimal dosing, training modalities and long-term benefits for metabolic outcomes.",

While CM supplementation is known to raise muscle creatine levels in vegans and vegetarians, its impact on exercise performance remains uncertain. We examined the effects of CM supplementation on muscle creatine content and exercise performance in vegans and vegetarians. In a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled design, 15 healthy vegans and vegetarians consumed CM (0.3 g/kg/day, n = 7) or placebo (PLA, 0.3 g maltodextrin/kg/day, n = 8) four times a day for 7 days. Before and after supplementation, repeated sprint capacity was determined. Body mass and fat-free mass (FFM) were assessed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. The CM group increased body mass (1.56 ± 0.57 kg, p < 0.01) and FFM (1.15 ± 0.94 kg, p < 0.05), while the PLA group showed no changes. In the CM group, muscle creatine (Cr) and total muscle creatine (TCr) increased by 18.8 ± 13.1 mmol/kg (p < 0.05) and 30.8 ± 21.2 mmol/kg (p < 0.01), respectively. The PLA group showed no changes in Cr and TCr (-4.6 ± 13.1 mmol/kg and 2.9 ± 11.6 mmol/kg, respectively). Phosphocreatine levels remained consistent within and between groups. There were no observed changes in peak and mean power output during repeated sprints.

    "abstract": "Urolithin A (UA) is a metabolite produced by gut bacteria following the consumption of ellagitannin-rich foods. Clinical trials in middle-aged and older adults demonstrated that supplementation with UA improves muscle strength, endurance, and biomarkers of mitochondrial health, suggesting that UA may be an effective ergogenic aid in other populations. In this double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled clinical trial (NCT04783207), competitive male distance runners (n = 42, 27.2 ± 1.0 years,  Running performance (3000 m time trial) was not significantly improved in either treatment group (UA; p = 0.116, PL; p = 0.771), although UA supplementation significantly lowered ratings of perceived exertion (RPE, p = 0.02) and reduced indirect markers of post-exercise muscle damage (CK, total area under the curve p < 0.0001) following the 3000 m time trial compared with PL. Although there was no statistically significant time × treatment interaction for aerobic capacity (p = 0.138), UA supplementation showed a large within-group increase in  Our results show that 4 weeks of daily UA supplementation facilitates recovery by downregulating inflammatory pathways and indirect markers of muscle damage. However, despite a reduction in rating of exertion and increased aerobic capacity, UA supplementation did not further enhance performance in highly trained male endurance athletes.",

    "title": "Creatine supplementation and muscle-brain axis: a new possible mechanism?",
    "abstract": "The brain and skeletal muscle have a high energy demand, of which creatine is an important regulator. Creatine acts as both a spatial and temporal energy buffer and reduces oxidative stress and inflammation. Creatine supplementation is well-recognized to enhance exercise performance, muscular strength and lean tissue mass, with emerging research showing benefits on cognitive function. Herein, we discuss the potential muscle-brain axis and the purported benefits of creatine supplementation on myokines, with a focus on brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Myokines and the muscle-brain axis have been implicated in strength, endurance, neuroprotection, and cognitive performance, particularly in aging and clinical conditions. Creatine is a pleiotropic molecule and the mechanisms are multifactorial, however, they appear to be associated with improved bioenergetics, muscle hypertrophy, anti-inflammatory effects and on improved glucose metabolism. Despite the growing body of research on creatine, limitations such as variability in study designs, dosages, and individual responses need to be carefully interpreted. Further research is warranted to verify this hypothesis and to establish optimal supplementation protocols, particularly, in terms of its short-term and long-term implications for neuromuscular and cognitive performance.",

    "abstract": "Creatine is a widely studied ergogenic aid known for its effects on muscle performance and body composition. However, its impact or utility for athletes involved in combat sports, who often aim to reduce body mass to meet a specific weight class, remains unclear. To conduct a narrative systematic review of peer-reviewed published studies that examined the effects of creatine supplementation on body mass, body composition, muscular strength, power, endurance, fatigue, recovery, and cognitive performance in combat sport athletes. A comprehensive search was conducted in multiple public databases up to March 2025. Databases searched included PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. Studies evaluating creatine supplementation in combat sports (eg wrestling, judo, taekwondo, boxing) were included. Outcomes assessed included changes in body mass and body composition, performance metrics, and markers of fatigue and recovery. Nineteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Creatine supplementation increased body mass, especially during longer-term interventions (≥6 wk) or when combined with structured resistance training. Creatine supplementation also increased measures of body mass and fat-free mass (FFM). Muscular power and maximal strength outcomes improved significantly after creatine supplementation, particularly in studies utilizing short-duration, high-intensity exercise protocols. Creatine supplementation did not influence measures of sport-specific endurance, recovery or fatigue. No serious adverse effects were reported across studies for creatine supplementation. Creatine supplementation enhances body mass, FFM, muscle strength and power in combat sport athletes. Given its safety and efficacy profile, creatine supplementation remains a promising supplement for supporting some aspects of athletic performance in combat sports.",

    "abstract": "Individuals undergoing chronic hemodialysis represent a population with high morbidity and mortality, primarily due to poor nutritional status, chronic inflammation, and cardiovascular disease. However, additional factors, such as low physical activity and impaired functionality, have also been identified as directly associated with increased mortality. This study was conceived as a pilot study to investigate whether creatine supplementation (5g/day) for eight weeks could provide benefits in terms of physical functionality, handgrip and body composition in a group of adult patients on chronic hemodialysis. On dialysis days, creatine was administered immediately post-dialysis, while on non-dialysis days, patients took the supplement at home. Measurements were taken using bioimpedance analysis, handgrip strength (via dynamometry), and the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), both before starting creatine supplementation and at week 8 of treatment. After performing robust statistical analysis, following creatine supplementation, an increase in SPPB scores was observed, with a mean improvement of 0.78 points [95% CI: 0.17-1.44] and an effect size of 0.53. Skeletal muscle mass increased by an average of 1.31 kg [95% CI: 0.55 to 2.23], with an effect size of 0.66. Fat-free mass showed a mean increase of 2.11 kg [95% CI: 0.75 to 3.58] with an effect size of 0.64, while phase angle rose by 0.52 degrees [95% CI: 0.27 to 0.76], corresponding to an effect size of 0.90. Regarding volumetric estimates, total body water increased by 1.17 L [95% CI: 0.26 to 2.13] with an effect size of 0.54, and intracellular water increased by 0.97 L [95% CI: 0.48 to 1.51] with an effect size of 0.81. No significant differences were observed in extracellular water with change of 0.20 L [95% CI: -0.30 to 0.70] or handgrip strength with an increment of 0.67 kgF, [95% CI: -0.67 to 2.11]. Oral creatine supplementation in HD patients for eight weeks improved muscular and functional outcomes and may be proposed as a strategy to mitigate the elevated morbidity observed in this group of patients.",

    "abstract": "As dietary supplements have become integral to meeting athletes' specialised nutritional requirements, research into their effects on performance has intensified. Yet inconsistent findings leave the efficacy of some supplements-most notably branched-chain amino acids and β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate (HMB)-open to debate. To clarify which products offer the greatest benefit, we undertook a systematic review and network meta-analysis aimed at identifying the supplements most effective for athletes, including protein, creatine, β-alanine, HMB, vitamin D, caffeine, and others. PubMed, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, Embase and SPORTDiscus were searched from database inception to 15 March 2024 for RCTs evaluating the effects of dietary supplements (including but not limited to protein, creatine, β-alanine, HMB, caffeine, and vitamin D) on athletic performance. Risk of bias was appraised with the revised Cochrane RoB 2 tool. A network meta-analysis was performed in R. We included 35 randomized controlled trials comprising 991 athletes who completed strength and conditioning training in conjunction with various dietary supplements or a placebo. The risk of bias assessment indicated that 8.57% of studies were at low risk, 88.57% had some concerns, and 2.86% were at high risk of bias. Protein supplementation yielded the greatest improvement in muscular strength (standardized mean difference [SMD] = 0.64, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.31-0.97; surface under the cumulative ranking curve [SUCRA] = 99.6%; very low-certainty evidence). Both β-alanine (SMD = 0.41, 95% CI 0.10-0.72; SUCRA = 89.0%; moderate-certainty evidence) and creatine (SMD = 0.30, 95% CI 0.07-0.53; SUCRA = 76.06%; moderate-certainty evidence) significantly enhanced jump performance, with β-alanine ranking marginally higher. Creatine also reduced sprint time (SMD = -0.42, 95% CI - 0.68 to -0.16; SUCRA = 94.57%; moderate-certainty evidence). No supplement significantly increased lean body mass. Protein supplementation appears to be the most effective strategy for increasing muscular strength; β-alanine and creatine both improve jump performance, with β-alanine offering marginally superior effectiveness; and creatine is particularly beneficial for sprint speed. As none of the supplements meaningfully increased muscle mass, practitioners should align supplementation strategies with the targeted performance attribute and training phase to optimise the synergy between nutrition and training and maximise athletic outcomes.

Accumulating research shows that CrM, primarily when combined with exercise training, is safe and has beneficial effects on measures of whole-body lean body mass, regional muscle size, muscle strength, bone area and thickness, functional ability, glucose kinetics, cognition and memory. CrM has multiple benefits in older adults and may have application for treating age-related sarcopenia, osteoporosis, frailty, and those with metabolic and neuromuscular disorders.",

    "abstract": "Following our previous research experiences on the 24-h ultramarathon (UM) race - a highly demanding competition characterized by acute cardiorespiratory and metabolic responses - we herein explored for the first time the metabolic profile of UM runners (n = 17) participating in a 24-h race via an untargeted metabolomic approach to gain further insights into the biochemical changes induced by the ultra-endurance performance. Metabolomics analysis was conducted on pre- and post-race plasma samples by high-resolution mass spectrometry in combination with reversed-phase chromatography. The major metabolic changes induced by the 24-h running concerned lipid metabolism, with an increase in medium- and long-chain fatty acids as energy sources for muscle contraction during the prolonged physical activity. A significant accumulation of oxidized metabolites from linoleic and arachidonic acids was also detected, which are potent mediators of cellular responses associated with oxidative/inflammatory processes that could be of clinical relevance for athletes' health. Notably, some metabolites presented positive correlations with athletic performance. Higher pre-race levels of 5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid (5-MTHF), as well as higher post-race levels of 5-MTHF, β-alanine, and creatine, were associated with a greater distance covered in 24 h. This evidence may suggest that nutritional supplementation can play an important role before and during the race to sustain athletes' capacity and exercise efficiency throughout such challenging sporting events. Overall, this study confirms that the metabolomic approach could be a helpful tool to the sport and health management of athletes, and to the identification of possible biomarkers of performance.",

    "abstract": "The 4Rs of sports nutrition were proposed in recent years as an evidence-based framework to optimize post-exercise recovery within the context of allostasis. Under this paradigm, it is important to consider that each R represents a factor with a tremendous influence on the allostatic response and improves individual components of the allostatic load (AL), which will positively impact the exercise-induced adaptations and the athlete's recovery. The 4Rs correspond to the following. (i) Rehydration-This is necessary to guarantee the post-exercise consumption of at least 150% of the body mass lost during the exercise accompanied by sodium (if faster replacement is required). (ii) Refuel-Carbohydrate intake (~1.2 g/kg body mass per hour for up to 4 h post-exercise) is essential not only in restoring glycogen reserves but also in supporting the energy needs of the immune system and facilitating tissue repair. Despite changes in substrate utilization, a ketogenic diet generally has neutral or negative effects on athletic performance compared to carbohydrate-rich diets. (iii) Repair-The ingestion of high-quality protein stimulates post-exercise net muscle protein anabolism and might contribute to faster tissue growth and repair. The use of certain supplements, such as creatine monohydrate, might help to enhance recovery, while tart cherry, omega-3 fatty acids, and dietary nitrate (e.g., ",

    "abstract": "Wrestling is a popular combat sport that requires muscular strength, power, agility, and endurance. Weight classes have motivated wrestlers to compete at a lower weight to optimise power-to-weight ratio and performance. To achieve these characteristics, athletes may use dietary supplements, however, their efficacy in wrestlers has not been systematically evaluated. The purpose was to systematically review the literature to determine the efficacy of dietary supplements to improve body composition, physiological status, and performance in wrestlers. A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, ProQuest Medline, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Scopus on the 21st of January 2024 and updated on the 6th of January 2025. Studies were included if the participants were healthy wrestlers ingesting any type of dietary supplement in comparison to a control. Data associated with intervention type and characteristics, target populations, outcomes, and analysis methods were extracted. A total of 24 eligible original articles were included that assessed various supplementation strategies on body composition, exercise performance, and metabolic markers in wrestlers. Individual studies revealed significant effects of sodium citrate, creatine monohydrate, spirulina, green tea and oolong tea extracts, and branched-chain amino acids on body mass or composition. β-Hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate (HMB-FA), creatine monohydrate, and iron supplementation improved recovery and may improve exercise performance. Beet-root juice supplementation enhanced muscular strength and balance. BCAA supplementation produced mixed results on muscle damage biomarkers and performance, while sodium citrate, creatine, and spirulina can act as buffering agents. Thyme tea appears to improve antioxidant capacity. Overall, individual studies show some promise for several dietary supplements to alter body mass and body composition, improve exercise recovery and performance, delay fatigue, and modify serum biomarkers; nevertheless, effect sizes were often small, and results were often mixed.",

Recent research suggests it may aid in treating some chronic diseases. This review analyzed the effects of creatine supplementation (CrS) on body composition in cancer patients or survivors. Following PRISMA guidelines, five databases were searched for studies up to September 12, reviewing seven articles with 463 participants (316 men, 147 women; average age 62.95 years). Five studies assessed CrS effects on body weight: three found no changes, while two reported increases. For lean body mass, three trials noted increases in both creatine and placebo groups, but differences were not significant. Fat mass results varied, showing reductions, no changes, or mitigated increases during hormone therapy. Although CrS showed potential improvements, evidence of significant effects on body composition in cancer patients remains limited. CrS appears safe and might be more beneficial with less aggressive treatments or in non-metastatic cases. Further research is needed to clarify its role in this context.",

    "abstract": "Muscle atrophy following spinal cord injury (SCI) is severe, often exceeding rates observed in disuse or critical illness. Neurogenic factors, such as the loss of neural input and disruption of neuromuscular signaling worsen the effects of physical inactivity. The severe muscle loss lowers muscle quality and impairs function, increasing the risk of chronic metabolic diseases. Understanding the mechanisms underlying SCI-induced muscle atrophy is crucial for developing targeted interventions. This review examines SCI-induced muscle atrophy mechanisms, addresses limitations of current interventions, and proposes therapeutic strategies integrating exercise mimetics, nutrition, and pharmacological agents to overcome anabolic resistance and improve muscle preservation. A PubMed search was conducted using terms including \"spinal cord injury\", \"disuse\", \"muscle atrophy\", \"anabolic resistance\", \"muscle protein metabolism\" and \"interventions\". (Pre)clinical studies and reviews relevant to skeletal muscle physiology after SCI were included. Anabolic resistance seems to be a key contributor to rapid SCI-induced muscle loss. Motor-complete SCI prevents voluntary contractions, limiting traditional exercise-based interventions. Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) can mitigate muscle atrophy during immobilization and critical illness especially when combined with protein supplementation. Additional nutritional interventions, including vitamin D, creatine, ursolic acid, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), and pharmacological agents such as androgens, myostatin inhibitors, and β2-adrenoceptor agonists, may further attenuate muscle atrophy. A multidimensional approach integrating NMES, targeted nutrition, and pharmacological strategies may enhance muscle mass retention, metabolic health, and rehabilitation outcomes in individuals with SCI. Further research is needed to refine these interventions and establish clinical guidelines for muscle preservation in this population.",

    "title": "Serum C-Terminal Agrin Fragment With Acute and Long-Term Exercise and Angiotensin II Type I Receptor Blockade.",
    "abstract": "Sarcopenia represents a major clinical and societal challenge facing rapidly aging populations. Accessible and specific biomarkers represent valuable tools, both in diagnosis and assessing the efficacy of therapeutic interventions. C-terminal agrin fragment (CAF) is the most commonly used blood-based biomarker of neuromuscular junction degradation in aging, inactivity and disease, but large unexplained interindividual variation exists, limiting its diagnostic and prognostic value. Exercise and medication may explain some of this variation. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of a single bout (1EX) or 48 bouts (48EX) of heavy resistance exercise (EX), with or without angiotensin II type I receptor blocker (losartan (LOS)) supplementation, on serum CAF levels in healthy older men. Eighty-three healthy, normotensive older men were enrolled in one of two randomized placebo (PLA) controlled trials. 1EX: 25 participants (EX ± LOS), with a mean age of 70 ± 7 years, had blood drawn before and after (4.5 h, Days 1, 4 and 7) a single bout of unilateral heavy resistance exercise of the quadriceps muscles. 48EX: at baseline, and after 8 and 16 weeks of a progressive heavy resistance exercise program, 58 participants (LOS-EX, n = 20; LOS-SED, n = 20; PLA-EX, n = 18), with a mean age of 72 ± 5 years, had blood drawn, and specific force (strength per unit mass) was measured by dynamometer and magnetic resonance imaging of the quadriceps muscles. Serum CAF was measured by ELISA. At baseline, CAF showed weak correlations with age and leg lean mass (both R Serum CAF was unaffected by 16 weeks of EX but increased by LOS supplementation. 1EX, performed with one leg, acutely lowered serum CAF, albeit with substantial interindividual variability. These findings collectively identify novel stimuli of serum CAF turnover-drug interaction and time from last exercise bout to blood sampling. These findings add value to CAF as a neuromuscular biomarker and highlight important experimental design aspects for future clinical studies.",

    "abstract": "Astaxanthin (AST), a potent antioxidant, has shown promise in improving poultry production metrics. This study investigated the effects of dietary AST on carcass traits, breast muscle composition, intestinal barrier function, cecal microbiota, and metabolomics in overfed Pekin ducks. A total of 150 one-day-old male Pekin ducks were assigned to five groups: Control (CON, basal diet), low-dose AST (LDG, 40 mg/kg), medium-dose (MDG, 80 mg/kg), high-dose (HDG, 120 mg/kg), and an ad libitum-fed group (ALG), and the feeding trial lasted for 42 days. Our findings revealed that AST significantly enhanced live and carcass weights, increased breast muscle mass in the HD group, and promoted subcutaneous fat deposition MD group, (P < 0.05). Supplementation of AST improved breast muscle amino acid profiles, especially phenylalanine, alanine, arginine, lysine, and tryptophan, and shifted fatty acid composition by reducing saturated fatty acids and increasing mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids, notably in the MDG (P < 0.05). Astaxanthin reduced serum total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol while increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P < 0.05). Furthermore, astaxanthin enhanced gut barrier integrity by lowering serum nitric oxide, endotoxin, and D-lactate levels and upregulating jejunal Mucin-2 and occludin gene expression (P < 0.05). Microbiota analysis revealed increases in Bacteroidota, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria, with beneficial associations between gut integrity and Weissella and Lactobacillus, and negative correlations with Faecalibacterium. Metabolomics identified enrichment of glycerophospholipid, tryptophan, glutathione, glycine‑serine-threonine, and aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis pathways. Key upregulated metabolites included 5-methoxyindoleacetate and glyceric acid, while Lysophosphatidylcholines (LysoPCs) were downregulated. 6-hydroxymelatonin and creatine were enriched but not significant. Microbiota-metabolome correlations indicated negative associations between Weissella and LysoPCs, Faecalibacterium and creatine, and a positive link between Collinsella and glyceric acid (P < 0.05), favoring gut health. Overall, AST improved carcass traits and intestinal function in overfed ducks via microbiota and metabolic modulation.",

    "title": "State-of-the-Art and Future Challenges for Nutritional Interventions in Facioscapulohumeral Dystrophy: A Narrative Review.",
    "abstract": "Facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD), the second most common inherited muscular dystrophy in adulthood, is characterized by progressive muscle loss, accompanied by an increase in fat mass. Beyond these alterations in body composition, which contribute to the risk of sarcopenic obesity, FSHD is associated with systemic inflammation and oxidative stress. These interconnected mechanisms may worsen muscle atrophy, leading to a decline in physical efficiency and quality of life. While the therapeutic benefits of physical therapy and exercise have been investigated, the impact of dietary interventions remains underexplored. Given the established role of nutrition in managing various chronic diseases, there is growing interest in understanding how it might influence the clinical management of FSHD. By addressing current gaps in the literature, this review aims to investigate the potential role of dietary patterns and specific nutrients in modulating muscle metabolism within the context of FSHD. Some studies have indicated various compounds (flavonoids, curcumin, L-carnitine, coenzyme Q10, and omega-3), vitamins (C and E), and minerals (zinc and selenium) with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties as promising treatment strategies for FSHD. Instead, few data regarding the effects of proteins and creatine supplementation are available. Furthermore, the potential benefits of essentials amino acids, β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate, and vitamin D in contrasting muscle atrophy and enhancing muscle function remain unexplored. Despite these preliminary findings, the existing body of evidence is limited. Identifying novel therapeutic strategies to complement existing treatments could provide a more comprehensive management framework, aimed at improving the long-term health outcomes and quality of life of FSHD patients.",

    "abstract": "Creatine is a widely used ergogenic aid that enhances muscle strength and lean mass. However, concerns have been raised about the potential role in promoting hair loss by increasing dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Currently, there is no direct evidence examining the relationship between creatine supplementation and hair follicle health. Therefore, the purpose was to determine the effects of 12 weeks of creatine supplementation on androgen levels and hair follicle health in healthy young males. Forty-five resistance-trained males (ages 18-40 years) were recruited and randomly assigned to either a creatine monohydrate (5 g/day) or placebo (5 g maltodextrin/day) group. Participants maintained their habitual diets and training routines. Blood samples were collected at baseline and after 12 weeks to measure total testosterone, free testosterone, and DHT. Hair follicle health was assessed using the Trichogram test and the FotoFinder system (hair density, follicular unit count, and cumulative hair thickness). Statistical analyses were performed using repeated measures ANOVA, and potential outliers were examined through sensitivity analysis. Thirty-eight participants completed the study, with no significant differences in baseline characteristics between groups. There were no group-by-time interactions observed for any hormones or hair-related outcomes ( This study was the first to directly assess hair follicle health following creatine supplementation, providing strong evidence against the claim that creatine contributes to hair loss.",

    "abstract": "Osteosarcopenia is an age-related condition characterized by reductions in bone mineral, muscle/lean mass, strength and functional ability which increases the risk of falls, fractures, frailty and premature mortality. One main contributing factor to osteosarcopenia is malnutrition. The purpose was to review recent evidence of creatine monohydrate (CrM) supplementation in older adults and to discuss the potential to manage osteosarcopenia. Accumulating research shows that CrM supplementation, primarily when combined with exercise training, has the potential to serve as a viable intervention in the management of osteosarcopenia. Collectively, CrM supplementation during exercise training in older adults led to greater improvements in whole-body lean mass, lower-limb muscle density and bone geometry and muscle strength (primarily upper-body) compared to exercise training alone. However, no study has investigated the effects of CrM, with and without exercise training, in older adults with osteosarcopenia. Given the positive findings of CrM on measures of muscle and bone in healthy older adults, there is potential for CrM to be added as an adjunct to exercise training in the management of osteosarcopenia. However, randomized clinical trials are needed to confirm the safety and efficacy of this nutrient in this clinical population.",

    "abstract": "Nutrition and exercise play a pivotal role in counteracting the effects of aging, promoting health, and improving physical fitness in older adults. This perspective study examines their interplay, highlighting their combined potential to preserve muscle mass, cognitive function, and quality of life. The objective is to address gaps in the current understanding, such as the frequent neglect of dietary intake in exercise interventions and vice versa, which can limit their effectiveness. Through a synthesis of the existing literature, we identify key findings, emphasizing the importance of adequate nutritional intake-particularly protein, essential amino acids, and micronutrients-in supporting exercise benefits and preventing sarcopenia and malnutrition. Additionally, supplementation strategies, such as omega-3 fatty acids, creatine, and essential amino acids, are explored alongside the emerging role of the gut microbiota in mediating the benefits of nutrition and exercise. Despite these advances, challenges remain, including determining optimal dosages and timing and addressing individual variability in responses. Personalized approaches tailored to sex differences, gut microbiota diversity, and baseline health conditions are critical for maximizing intervention outcomes. Our conclusions underscore the necessity of integrated strategies that align dietary and exercise interventions to support healthy and active aging. By addressing these gaps, future research can provide actionable insights to optimize health and quality of life in older populations.",

    "abstract": "Position Statement: The International Society of Sports Nutrition (ISSN) bases the following position stand on an analysis of the literature regarding the effects of β-Hydroxy-β-Methylbutyrate (HMB). The following 12 points have been approved by the Research Committee of the Society: 1. HMB is a metabolite of the amino acid leucine that is naturally produced in both humans and other animals. Two forms of HMB have been studied: Calcium HMB (HMB-Ca) and a free acid form of HMB (HMB-FA). HMB-FA appears to lead to increased appearance of HMB in the bloodstream when compared to HMB-Ca, though recent results are mixed. 2. The available safety/toxicity data suggest that chronic HMB-Ca and HMB-FA consumption are safe for oral HMB supplementation in humans up to at least one year. 3. There are no negative effects of HMB-Ca and HMB-FA on glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in humans. There may be improvements in glucose metabolism in younger adults. 4. The primary mode of action of HMB appears to be through its dual mechanism to enhance muscle protein synthesis and suppress muscle protein breakdown. HMB's activation of mTORC1 is independent of the leucine-sensing pathway (Sestrin2-GATOR2 complex). 5. HMB may help reduce muscle damage and promote muscle recovery, which can promote muscle growth/repair. HMB may also have anti-inflammatory effects, which could contribute to reducing muscle damage and soreness. 6. HMB consumption in close proximity to an exercise bout may be beneficial to increase muscle protein synthesis and attenuate the inflammatory response. HMB can provide a beneficial physiological effect when consumed both acutely and chronically in humans. 7. Daily HMB supplementation (38 mg/kg body weight) in combination with exercise training may improve body composition through increasing lean mass and/or decreasing fat mass with benefits in participants across age, sex, and training status. The most pronounced of these improvements in body composition with HMB have been observed in studies with robust resistance training programs and dietary control. 8. HMB may improve strength and power in untrained individuals, but its performance benefits in trained athletes are mixed and increase with an increase in study duration (>6 weeks). HMB's beneficial effects on athletic performance are thought to be driven by improved recovery. 9. HMB supplementation appears to potentially have a positive impact on aerobic performance, especially in trained athletes. The mechanisms of the effects are unknown. 10. HMB supplementation may be important in a non-exercising sedentary and aging population to improve muscle strength, functionality, and muscle quality. The effects of HMB supplementation with exercise are varied, but the combination may have a beneficial effect on the treatment of age-associated sarcopenia under select conditions. 11. HMB may be effective in countering muscle disuse atrophy during periods of inactivity due to illness or injury. The modulation of mitochondrial dynamics and lipid metabolism by HMB may be a potential mechanism for preventing disuse atrophy and aiding rehabilitation beyond HMB's effects on rates of muscle protein synthesis and degradation. 12. The efficacy of HMB in combination with certain nutrients may be enhanced under select conditions.",

This study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluating the effectiveness of creatine supplementation for older people during seven days of hospitalization for stroke compared to usual care. The primary outcome measures were changes in functional capacity, strength, muscle mass, and muscle degradation. The secondary outcomes were changes in serum biomarkers related to inflammation, fibrosis, anabolism, and muscle synthesis. In addition, a follow-up 90 days after the stroke verified functional capacity, strength, quality of life, and mortality. Following admission for an acute stroke, participants received either creatine (10 g) or a visually identical placebo (10 g) orally twice daily. Both groups received supplementation with protein to achieve the goal of 1.5 g of protein/kg of body weight/day and underwent daily mobility training during seven days of hospitalization. Thirty older people were included in two similar groups concerning baseline attributes (15-treatment/15-placebo). Creatine supplementation did not influence functional capacity, strength, or muscle mass during the first 7 days or outcomes 90 days after stroke. There were no serious adverse events associated with creatine supplementation. However, it decreased progranulin levels, raising a new possibility of creatine action. This finding needs further exploration to understand the biological significance of creatine-progranulin interaction.",

    "title": "Supplementing With Which Form of Creatine (Hydrochloride or Monohydrate) Alongside Resistance Training Can Have More Impacts on Anabolic/Catabolic Hormones, Strength and Body Composition?",
    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of resistance training (RT) alongside creatine-hydrochloride (Cr-HCl) or creatine monohydrate (CrM) supplementation on anabolic/catabolic hormones, strength, and body composition. Forty participants with an age range of 18-25 years were randomly divided into four groups (n=10): RT+Cr-HCl (0.03 g.kg-1 of body mass), RT+CrM-loading phase (CrM-LP) (0.3 g.kg-1 of body mass for five days (loading) and 0.03 g.kg-1 body mass for 51 days (maintenance)), RT+CrM-without loading phase (CrM-WLP) (0.03 g.kg-1 body mass), and RT+placebo (PL). The participants consumed supplements and performed RT with an intensity of 70-85 % 1RM for eight weeks. Before and after the training and supplementation period, strength (1RM), body composition (percent body fat (PBF), skeletal muscle mass (SMM), muscular cross-sectional area (MCSA)) and serum levels of testosterone, growth hormone (GH), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), cortisol, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), follistatin and myostatin were measured. The results showed that in the supplementation groups, strength, arm and thigh MCSA, and SMM significantly increased, and PBF significantly decreased (P</=0.05); this change was significant compared to the PL group (P</=0.05). In addition, the results showed a significant increase in GH, IGF-1 levels, the ratio of follistatin/myostatin, testosterone/cortisol (P</=0.05), and a significant decrease in cortisol and ACTH levels (P</=0.05) in the supplementation groups. Hormonal changes in GH, IGF-1, testosterone/cortisol, cortisol, and ACTH levels in the supplementation groups were significant compared to the PL group (P</=0.05). The results showed that CrM and Cr-HCl significantly enhanced the beneficial effects of RT on strength, hypertrophy, and hormonal responses, with Cr-HCl showing no benefit over CrM.",

    "title": "Dietary glycine supplementation enhances creatine availability in tissues of pigs with intrauterine growth restriction.",
    "abstract": "This study tested the hypothesis that dietary supplementation with glycine (Gly) enhances the synthesis and availability of creatine (Cr) in tissues of pigs with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). At weaning (21 d of age), IUGR pigs and litter mates with normal birth weights (NBW) were assigned randomly to 1 of the 2 groups, namely, supplementation with 1% Gly or 1.19% l-alanine (isonitrogenous control) to a corn- and soybean meal-based diet. Blood, kidneys, liver, pancreas, jejunum, longissimus lumborum muscle (LLM), and gastrocnemius muscle (GM) were obtained from the pigs within 1 wk after the feeding trial ended at 188 d of age to determine concentrations of guanidinoacetate (GAA), Cr, creatinine, and phosphocreatine (CrP). The organs were also analyzed for activities and mRNA levels for Cr-synthetic enzymes: l-arginine:glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT; forming GAA from Gly and l-arginine) and guanidinoacetate n-methyltransferase (GAMT; converting GAA and l-methionine into Cr). AGAT activity was present in the kidneys, liver, and pancreas, whereas GAMT activity was found in all the organs analyzed. AGAT and GAMT were most active per gram of tissue in the kidneys and pancreas, respectively. Based on tissue mass, the kidneys had the greatest (P < 0.001) AGAT activity per whole organ, followed by the liver, while skeletal muscle had the greatest (P < 0.001) GAMT activity per whole organ, followed by the liver. Thus, the kidneys played a dominant role in forming GAA, whereas skeletal muscle and liver were the major sites for converting GAA into Cr. Dietary supplementation with 1% Gly enhanced AGAT activity in the kidneys and pancreas but reduced GAMT activity in the pancreas and small intestine, therefore directing GAA to the liver and skeletal muscle for Cr production. IUGR selectively reduced the concentration of Cr in LLM among all the organs studied. Except for the GM that had greater mRNA levels for GAMT in IUGR than in NBW pigs, neither Gly nor IUGR affected mRNA levels for the selected genes in the tissues examined. Collectively, these novel results indicate that dietary Gly intake upregulates the Cr-synthetic pathway in swine. Creatine is essential for growth and energy metabolism in animal tissues but is absent from conventional plant (e.g., corn- and soybean meal)-based diets that contain no animal-sourced ingredients. Thus, livestock (including swine) must synthesize a large amount of creatine from amino acids such as glycine. However, how creatine is formed in growing-finishing pigs remains unknown. Additionally, pigs have the greatest rate of intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) among livestock species. Because IUGR reduces growth and meat quality, it is imperative to identify interorgan cooperation for creatine synthesis in pigs, particularly those affected by IUGR. Based on the findings of our recently published work that dietary glycine supplementation enhanced the growth performance of IUGR pigs from weaning to market weight, the current research tested the hypothesis that this nutritional strategy also increased the synthesis and availability of creatine in their tissues. Results of the present study indicate that the kidneys are primarily responsible for forming guanidinoacetate from glycine and arginine, whereas skeletal muscle and liver play major roles in converting guanidinoacetate into creatine. Furthermore, dietary supplementation with 1% glycine enhanced the activities of enzymes for creatine synthesis in a tissue-specific manner, as well as concentrations of creatine plus phosphocreatine in the kidneys, liver, pancreas, small intestine, and skeletal muscle of both IUGR and normal-birthweight pigs. Notably, glycine supplementation prevented a decrease in concentrations of creatine in the longissimus lumborum muscle of IUGR pigs. Our findings support the notion that conventional corn- and soybean meal-based diets do not provide sufficient glycine for creatine synthesis in pigs. Dietary glycine supplementation is crucial for their maximal growth and optimal health.",

    "abstract": "Sarcopenia, generally characterized by the age-related reduction in muscle strength, lean/muscle mass and functional ability, is also associated with reduced bone mass and strength and impaired brain health and function. One potential intervention which has received much 'hype' over the past few decades to countermeasure these negative consequences of biological aging is creatine monohydrate supplementation. From a skeletal muscle perspective, the combination of creatine monohydrate supplementation and resistance training provides 'hope' for older adults as it improves measures of lean mass, regional (limb) muscle thickness, upper- and lower-body muscle strength and functional ability. Further, there is some evidence that creatine (supplementation or habitual diet) provides a ray of 'hope' for improving some aspects of cognitive function. The majority of research suggests that creatine is more 'hype' than 'hope' for improving measures of bone mass in older adults. Creatine monohydrate supplementation provides some anti-sarcopenic benefits for older adults.",

The prevalence of acute sarcopenia ranges from 28% to 69%, likely underdiagnosed due to the absence of muscle mass and function assessments in most clinical settings. Systemic inflammation, immune-endocrine dysregulation, and anabolic resistance are identified as key pathophysiological factors. Interventions include early mobilization, resistance exercise, neuromuscular electrical stimulation, and nutritional strategies such as protein supplementation, leucine, β-hydroxy-β-methyl-butyrate, omega-3 fatty acids, and creatine monohydrate. Pharmaceuticals show variable efficacy. Future research should prioritize serial monitoring of muscle parameters, identification of predictive biomarkers, and the involvement of multidisciplinary teams from hospital admission to address sarcopenia.

    "title": "Nutritional strategies for improving sarcopenia outcomes in older adults: A narrative review.",
    "abstract": "Sarcopenia is characterized by a decline in muscle strength, generalized loss of skeletal muscle mass, and impaired physical performance, which are common outcomes used to screen, diagnose, and determine severity of sarcopenia in older adults. These outcomes are associated with poor quality of life, increased risk of falls, hospitalization, and mortality in this population. The development of sarcopenia is underpinned by aging, but other factors can lead to sarcopenia, such as chronic diseases, physical inactivity, inadequate dietary energy intake, and reduced protein intake (nutrition-related sarcopenia), leading to an imbalance between muscle protein synthesis and muscle protein breakdown. Protein digestion and absorption are also modified with age, as well as the reduced capacity of metabolizing protein, hindering older adults from achieving ideal protein consumption (i.e., 1-1.5 g/kg/day). Nutritional supplement strategies, like animal (i.e., whey protein) and plant-based protein, leucine, and creatine have been shown to play a significant role in improving outcomes related to sarcopenia. However, the impact of other supplements (e.g., branched-chain amino acids, isolated amino acids, and omega-3) on sarcopenia and related outcomes remain unclear. This narrative review will discuss the evidence of the impact of these nutritional strategies on sarcopenia outcomes in older adults.",

    "abstract": "Skeletal muscle (SkM) atrophy results from metabolic disorders causing body and muscle mass loss, affecting morbidity and mortality. Increased oxidative stress, inflammation, and poor prognosis are the leading causes of involuntary weight loss. Ursolic acid (UA), known for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, can potentially reduce oxidative stress and inflammation in muscles, but its effects on muscle mass regulation are still unknown. Therefore, the present study investigated the medicinal efficacy of UA and its mode of action against the murine model of SkM atrophy over 7 days of UA supplementation. Denervation-induced SkM atrophy significantly impacts overall body weight and the weight of individual muscles (p < 0.05). However, supplementation with UA can effectively counteract these effects by promoting the synthesis of the slow-myosin heavy chain, thereby restoring body weight and myotube diameter. Moreover, UA also plays a crucial role in reducing the production levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipid peroxidation (LPO), and caspase-3-like activity in atrophied muscles. UA also prevents the leakage of creatine kinase (CK) through the upregulation of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) expression. Furthermore, the results obtained from qRT-PCR demonstrated a significant decrease in the levels of pro-inflammatory markers, namely IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and TWEAK, up to four-fold after the third day of the UA intervention. UA also upregulated PGC-1α, Bcl2, and p-Akt",

Although lysine and threonine are often used to enhance protein synthesis and muscle mass in horses, their impact on mare milk yield and nutrient composition remains underexplored. This study investigated the effects of lysine and threonine supplementation on 24 healthy Yili mares, mares at day 30 of lactation, over a 120-day period. The mares were divided into control and three experimental groups (six mares each) under pure grazing conditions. The control group received no amino acid supplementation, while experimental groups received varying daily doses of lysine and threonine: Group I (40 g lysine + 20 g threonine), Group II (60 g lysine + 40 g threonine), and Group III (80 g lysine + 60 g threonine). Supplementation in Group II notably increased milk yield, while Groups I and II showed higher milk fat percentages, and all experimental groups exhibited improved milk protein percentages. Additionally, blood levels of total protein, albumin, triglycerides, and glucose were reduced. Detailed analyses from Group II at peak lactation (day 60) included targeted metabolomics and microbial sequencing of milk, blood, and fecal samples. Amino acid metabolomics assessed amino acid content in mare milk and serum, while 16S rRNA gene sequencing evaluated rectal microbial composition. The results indicated that lysine and threonine supplementation significantly increased levels of threonine and creatine in the blood, and lysine, threonine, glutamine, and alanine in mare milk.

    "abstract": "Maintaining skeletal muscle mass is important for improving muscle strength and function. Hence, maximizing lean body mass (LBM) is the primary goal for both elite athletes and fitness enthusiasts. The use of amino acids as dietary supplements is widespread among athletes and physically active individuals. Extensive literature analysis reveals that branched-chain amino acids (BCAA), creatine, glutamine and β-alanine may be beneficial in regulating skeletal muscle metabolism, enhancing LBM and mitigating exercise-induced muscle damage. This review details the mechanisms of these amino acids, offering insights into their efficacy as supplements. Recommended dosage and potential side effects are then outlined to aid athletes in making informed choices and safeguard their health. Lastly, limitations within the current literature are addressed, highlighting opportunities for future research.",

    "abstract": "The use of steroids and protein-based dietary supplements for muscle enhancement is prevalent in contemporary society. While these products promise increased muscle mass and strength, they carry significant risks, including severe medical complications. The consumption of these supplements has been linked to adverse symptoms, including dehydration, gastrointestinal distress, dizziness, and alterations in heart rate and blood pressure, primarily due to ingredients like creatine, arginine, and caffeine. Following the proper dosage, ensuring adequate hydration, and consulting a healthcare provider to verify if the supplement's components could affect any pre-existing conditions is recommended. Indiscriminate use of these products, including taurine, can lead to serious side effects. We present a 36-year-old patient with severe rhabdomyolysis, life-threatening acid-base imbalance, renal and liver injury, and peripheral neuropathy associated with the use of performance-enhanced unregulated supplements and exercise. This case highlights the importance of recognizing and managing complications related to exercise-aid supplements, emphasizing early identification and management. Increasing social awareness and research on those products is highly needed to avoid supplement-associated complications and potential long-term disabilities.",

    "abstract": "Exhausting exercise can damage muscle tissue due to free radical interactions. It is hypothesized that the increase in free radicals following muscle injury, either due to oxidative damage to biomolecules or the activation of inflammatory cytokines, may lead to secondary muscle damage. This study investigated the effects of a novel joint health formula (JHF) containing bisdemethoxycurcumin-enriched curcumin, 3-O-Acetyl-11-keto-beta-boswellic acid-enriched Boswellia (AKBA), and Ashwagandha on exhaustion time, grip strength, antioxidant status, and muscle-signaling proteins in exhaustively exercised rats. Twenty-eight rats were divided into four groups: Control (C), exercise (E), E + JHF 100 (100 mg/kg), and E + JHF 200 (200 mg/kg). An increase in time to exhaustion and grip strength was recorded with JHF supplementation in a dose-dependent manner (p < 0.0001). In addition, serum and muscle lactate dehydrogenase, malondialdehyde, myoglobin, creatine kinase, and lactic acid concentrations were decreased in the groups supplemented with JHF, particularly at the high dose of JHF (200 mg/kg) (p < 0.0001 for all). JHF supplementation also increased antioxidant enzyme activities and suppressed the production of inflammatory cytokines compared to the exercise group (p < 0.0001). Moreover, JHF reduced the levels of PGC-1α, p-70S6K1, MAFbx, MuRF1, and p-mTOR proteins in muscle tissue compared to the exercise group (p < 0.05), being more effective at high doses. These findings show that JHF might reduce muscle damage by modulating antiinflammatory, antioxidant, and muscle mass regulatory pathways in exhausted training rats. At the same time, JHF improved exercise performance and grip strength.",

    "title": "Creatine supplementation and resistance training to preserve muscle mass and attenuate cancer progression (CREATINE-52): a protocol for a double-blind randomized controlled trial.",
    "abstract": "Muscle mass is important for metastatic prostate cancer survival and quality of life (QoL). The backbone of treatment for men with metastatic castration sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC) is androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with an androgen signaling inhibitor. ADT is an effective cancer treatment, but it facilitates significant declines in muscle mass and adverse health outcomes important to mCSPC survivors, such as fatigue, and reductions in physical function, independence, insulin sensitivity, and QoL. In non-metastatic CSPC survivors, resistance training (RT) preserves muscle mass and improves these related health outcomes, but the biggest barrier to RT in CSPC survivors of all stages is fatigue. Creatine monohydrate supplementation coupled with RT (Cr + RT) may address this barrier since creatine plays a critical role in energy metabolism. Cr + RT in cancer-free older adults and other clinical populations improves muscle mass and related health outcomes. Evidence also suggests that creatine supplementation can complement cancer treatment. Thus, Cr + RT is a strategy that addresses gaps in survivorship needs of people with mCSPC. The purpose of this parallel, double-blind randomized controlled trial is to test the effects of 52-weeks of Cr + RT compared with placebo (PLA) and RT (PLA + RT) on muscle mass, other related health outcomes, and markers of cancer progression. We will carry out this trial with our team's established, effective, home-based, telehealth RT program in 200 mCSPC survivors receiving ADT, and evaluate outcomes at baseline, 24-, and 52-weeks. RT will occur twice weekly with elastic resistance bands, and an established creatine supplementation protocol will be used for supplementation delivery. Our approach addresses a major facilitator to RT in mCSPC survivors, a home-based RT program, while utilizing a supervised model for safety. Findings will improve delivery of comprehensive survivorship care by providing a multicomponent, patient-centered lifestyle strategy to preserve muscle mass, improve health outcomes, and complement cancer treatment (NCT06112990).",

Creatine is a critical regulator of adipose metabolic function and low-dose lithium supplementation has been shown to promote adipose thermogenesis. In the present study, we sought to directly compare the two supplements for their effects on adipose metabolism and thermogenesis. We show that both supplements increase daily energy expenditure (EE) and reduce body mass in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Lithium increased brown adipose tissue (BAT) mitochondrial and lipolytic proteins that are associated with thermogenesis, while creatine increased BAT UCP1 and mitochondrial respiration. The BAT thermogenic findings were not observed in females. White adipose tissue and skeletal muscle markers of thermogenesis were unaltered with the supplements. Together, the data show that low-dose lithium and creatine have diverging effects on markers of BAT thermogenesis and that each increase daily EE and lower body mass in a sex-dependent manner.",

    "title": "Dietary Methionine Enhances Portal Appearance of Guanidinoacetate and Synthesis of Creatine in Yucatan Miniature Piglets.",
    "abstract": "Creatine plays a significant role in energy metabolism and positively impacts anaerobic energy capacity, muscle mass, and physical performance. Endogenous creatine synthesis requires guanidinoacetic acid (GAA) and methionine. GAA can be an alternative to creatine supplements and has been tested as a beneficial feed additive in the animal industry. When pigs are fed GAA with excess methionine, creatine is synthesized without feedback regulation. In contrast, when dietary methionine is limited, creatine synthesis is limited, yet, GAA does not accumulate in plasma, urine, or liver. We hypothesized that portal GAA appearance requires adequate dietary methionine. Yucatan miniature piglets (17-21 d old; n = 20) were given a 4 h duodenal infusion of complete elemental diets with supplemental GAA plus 1 of 4 methionine concentrations representing either 20%, 80%, 140%, or 200% of the dietary methionine requirement. Arterial and portal blood metabolites were measured along with blood flow to determine mass balance across the gut. [ GAA balance across the gut was highest in the 200% methionine group, indicating excess dietary methionine enhanced GAA absorption. Creatine synthesis in the liver and jejunum was higher with higher concentrations of methionine, emphasizing that the transmethylation of GAA to creatine depends on sufficient dietary methionine. Hepatic GAA concentration was higher in the 20% methionine group, suggesting low dietary methionine limited GAA conversion to creatine, which led to GAA accumulation in the liver. GAA absorption and conversion to creatine require a sufficient amount of methionine, and the supplementation strategies should accommodate this interaction.",

Thus, we aimed to evaluate the effect of creatine supplementation on the body composition and Malnutrition-Inflammation Score (MIS) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) undergoing hemodialysis. An exploratory 1-year balanced, placebo-controlled, and double-blind design was conducted with hemodialysis patients (≥18 years).

After 6 months, 60% of patients on creatine experienced an increase in FFM compared to a 36.8% increase for those on placebo. Moreover, 65% of patients on creatine increased their skeletal muscle mass index (SMMI) compared to only 15.8% for those on placebo. Creatine increased intracellular water (ICW) in 60% of patients.

We conducted a systematic literature search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and CINAHL from inception to November 2022. Studies included were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing creatine supplementation with placebos in older adults and adults with chronic disease. The primary outcome was physical function measured by the sit-to-stand test after pooling data using random-effects modeling. We also performed a Bayesian meta-analysis to describe the treatment effect in probability terms. Secondary outcomes included other measures of physical function, muscle function, and body composition. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. We identified 33 RCTs, comprising 1076 participants. From six trials reporting the primary outcome, the pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) was 0.51 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.01-1.00; I Creatine supplementation improves sit-to-stand performance, muscle function, and lean tissue mass.

The first training resistance group (RG) will perform resistance training, while the second experimental resistance-creatine group will perform the same resistance training as the RG and will also receive a 5 g/d creatine supplementation during the intervention. RG participants will follow the same daily dosing protocol, but in their case, with dextrose/maltodextrin. Resistance training will be a 16-week supervised workout that will consist of a series of resistance exercises (leg press, knee extension, knee bends, chest press, sit-ups, back extensions, pull-ups, and shoulder press) that involve the largest muscle groups, performed 3 times a week on nonconsecutive days. Both the RG and the resistance-creatine group will receive a supplement of soluble protein powder (20 to 30 g) daily. This intervention will help to better understand the potential of nonpharmacological treatment for improving strength and well-being values in patients with breast cancer with and without creatine supplementation.",

    "abstract": "Skeletal muscle is the key tissue for maintaining protein and glucose homeostasis, having a profound impact on the development of diabetes. Diabetes causes deleterious changes in terms of loss of muscle mass, which will contribute to reduced glucose uptake and therefore progression of the disease. Nutritional approaches in diabetes have been directed to increase muscle glucose uptake, and improving protein turnover has been at least partially an oversight. In muscle, β-hydroxy β-methyl butyrate (HMB) promotes net protein synthesis, while arginine and lysine increase glucose uptake, albeit their effects on promoting protein synthesis are limited. This study evaluates if the combination of HMB, lysine, and arginine could prevent the loss of muscle mass and function, reducing the progression of diabetes. Therefore, the combination of these ingredients was tested in vitro and in vivo. In muscle cell cultures, the supplementation enhances glucose uptake and net protein synthesis due to an increase in the amount of GLUT4 transporter and stimulation of the insulin-dependent signaling pathway involving IRS-1 and Akt. In vivo, using a rat model of diabetes, the supplementation increases lean body mass and insulin sensitivity and decreases blood glucose and serum glycosylated hemoglobin. In treated animals, an increase in GLUT4, creatine kinase, and Akt phosphorylation was detected, demonstrating the synergic effects of the three ingredients. Our findings showed that nutritional formulations based on the combination of HMB, lysine, and arginine are effective, not only to control blood glucose levels but also to prevent skeletal muscle atrophy associated with the progression of diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Gut microbiota (GM) might play a role in muscle metabolism and physiological processes through a hypothesized gut-muscle axis, influencing muscle mass and function and thus, sarcopenia. The Trial in Elderly with Musculoskeletal Problems due to Underlying Sarcopenia-Faeces to Unravel the Gut and Inflammation Translationally (TEMPUS-FUGIT) aims to explore the gut-muscle axis in sarcopenia. First, in a cross-sectional case-control phase, 100 community-dwelling adults without sarcopenia will be compared to 100 community-dwelling adults (≥ 65 years) with sarcopenia of similar age-, gender and BMI-ratio, participating in the ongoing 'Exercise and Nutrition for Healthy AgeiNg' (ENHANce; NCT03649698) study. Sarcopenia is diagnosed according to the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People 2 (EWGSOP2) criteria. GM composition and intestinal inflammatory markers (fecal calprotectin, lactoferrin and S100A12) will be determined in fecal samples. Systemic inflammatory markers (hs-CRP, IL-4, IL-6, TNF-α, IL-13, IL-1β and creatine kinase) will be determined in fasted blood samples. Both groups will be compared using appropriate statistical testing, whereas linear regression will be used for cross-sectional associations between gut, inflammatory and sarcopenia parameters. Second, in the longitudinal phase, sarcopenic older adults will be requested to deliver five fecal samples during the 12-week intervention to assess the effects of protein, omega-3 and a physical exercise program on the GM. TEMPUS-FUGIT aims to explore the gut-muscle axis by comparing GM composition between sarcopenic and non-sarcopenic older adults and to determine the association of GM with intestinal and systemic inflammatory markers and sarcopenia-defining parameters (muscle mass, muscle strength and physical performance). Furthermore, effects of single or combined, optimized and individualized anabolic interventions (exercise, protein and omega-3 supplementation), on GM will be explored in persons with sarcopenia. TEMPUS-FUGIT aims to impact clinical practice by clarifying the relationship between the gut-muscle axis and sarcopenia. TEMPUS-FUGIT is expected to contribute to the discovery of clinical and microbial biomarkers for sarcopenia and insights in its pathophysiology, opening possible future perspectives for novel sarcopenia treatment strategies targeting GM.

    "abstract": "Using the guidelines from the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), this meta-analysis (MA) tried to figure out how well creatine (Cr) improves metabolic performance. We searched Google Scholar, PubMed, and the Cochrane Library to identify relevant randomized clinical trials (RCTs) exploring the various effects of Cr across different age groups compared to a placebo (PLA). We also investigated the synergistic effects of combining other supplements with Cr. In order to emphasize the different ways and sports where Cr has been used in the past years, we found from the selected articles that Cr demonstrated a more pronounced effect during aerobic or anaerobic exercise compared to PLA groups in the studies. Furthermore, in sports that demand significant cumulative energy, such as long-distance races, biking, or triathlons, athletes have observed performance enhancements with Cr supplementation. We also stipulate that Cr enhances resistance training in people over 50 years old and that adding other training supplements, such as β-hydroxy β-methylbutyrate (HMB), synergistically improves training outcomes when combined with Cr. The current MA was based on a thorough analysis of 10 separate studies. When these results were added together, we found that taking Cr supplements demonstrated statistically significant benefits over PLA. In conclusion, the present MA has found evidence that Cr has positive effects on metabolic outcomes for people who consume it.",

Several independent lines of evidence support that higher protein diets, which can be readily achieved through animal-based protein supplements, optimize muscle mass during periods of resistance training, and this likely facilitates strength increases. Creatine monohydrate supplementation and peri-exercise caffeine consumption also enhance strength and power through distinct mechanisms. Supplements that favorably affect aspects of endurance performance include peri-exercise caffeine, nitrate-containing supplements (e.g., beet root juice), and sodium bicarbonate consumption. Further, beta-alanine supplementation can enhance high-intensity endurance exercise efforts. Select dietary supplements can enhance strength and endurance outcomes, and take-home recommendations will be provided for athletes and practitioners aiming to adopt these strategies.",

    "abstract": "Dietary supplements are widely used among athletes, and soccer players are no exception. Nevertheless, evidence supporting the use of dietary supplements aiming to enhance performance in soccer is somewhat contradictory, scarce, or even nonexistent. Thus, the present study aimed to systematically review and synthesize the effects of dietary supplements on athletic performance (e.g. distance covered, sprinting, jump performance) in elite soccer players. Studies enrolling highly trained, elite, and world-class soccer players using dietary supplements were searched in MEDLINE/PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and EBSCO databases in June 2022. In total, 1043 studies were identified, and 18 met the eligibility criteria. The studies evaluated the impacts on athletic performance of several dietary supplements, including caffeine, creatine, protein, beverages with carbohydrates and electrolytes, tart cherry juice, nitrate-rich beetroot juice, sodium bicarbonate with minerals, yohimbine, and a proprietary nutraceutical blend. Caffeine supplementation in doses between 3 and 6 mg/kg of body mass may improve jump height and sprint ability, particularly in female players, but individual response to caffeine must be considered. Creatine may improve sprint, agility, and in female players, jump performance. Protein supplementation can improve sprint and jump performance between matches, especially if protein ingested from food is not up to recommendations. Beverages containing carbohydrates and electrolytes can be used as part of the strategies to achieve carbohydrate intake during training and match-days but used alone do not benefit athletic performance. Tart cherry juice might be useful for maintaining athletic performance after matches that produce higher force loss and exercise-induced muscle damage, although polyphenols from the diet might attenuate the effects of tart cherry supplementation. Nitrate-rich beetroot concentrate can attenuate performance decrease in the days following matches. Further investigation with sodium bicarbonate alone is necessary, as supplementation protocols with elite players included other substances. Finally, the available data does not support yohimbine supplementation or the use of Resurgex Plus® to improve athletic performance in elite soccer players. Still, more well-designed research with elite soccer players is needed to improve support and advice regarding the use of dietary supplements for athletic performance enhancement.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this paper was to carry out a systematic review with a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials that examined the combined effects of resistance training (RT) and creatine supplementation on regional changes in muscle mass, with direct imaging measures of hypertrophy. Moreover, we performed regression analyses to determine the potential influence of covariates. We included trials that had a duration of at least 6 weeks and examined the combined effects of creatine supplementation and RT on site-specific direct measures of hypertrophy (magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), or ultrasound) in healthy adults. A total of 44 outcomes were analyzed across 10 studies that met the inclusion criteria. A univariate analysis of all the standardized outcomes showed a pooled mean estimate of 0.11 (95% Credible Interval (CrI): -0.02 to 0.25), providing evidence for a very small effect favoring creatine supplementation when combined with RT compared to RT and a placebo. Multivariate analyses found similar small benefits for the combination of creatine supplementation and RT on changes in the upper and lower body muscle thickness (0.10-0.16 cm). Analyses of the moderating effects indicated a small superior benefit for creatine supplementation in younger compared to older adults (0.17 (95%CrI: -0.09 to 0.45)). In conclusion, the results suggest that creatine supplementation combined with RT promotes a small increase in the direct measures of skeletal muscle hypertrophy in both the upper and lower body.",

    "title": "Role of Nutritional Supplements on Gut-Muscle Axis Across Age: a Mini-Review.",
    "abstract": "Sarcopenia is a progressive skeletal muscle disorder associated with aging, resulting in loss of muscle mass and function. It has been linked to inflammation, oxidative stress, insulin resistance, hormonal changes (i.e. alterations in the levels or activity of hormones which can occur due to a variety of factors, including aging, stress, disease, medication, and environmental factors), and impaired muscle satellite cell activation. The gut microbiome is also essential for muscle health, and supplements such as probiotics, prebiotics, protein, creatine, and betaalanine can support muscle growth and function while also promoting gut health. Chronic low-grade inflammation is a leading cause of sarcopenia, which can activate signaling pathways that lead to muscle wasting and reduce muscle protein synthesis. Insulin resistance, hormonal changes, and impaired muscle satellite cell activation contribute to sarcopenia, and high levels of fat mass also play a role in the pathogenesis of sarcopenia. Resistance exercise and dietary supplementation have been shown to be effective treatments for sarcopenia. In addition, a combination of resistance exercise and supplementation has been shown to have a more significant beneficial effect on anthropometric and muscle function parameters, leading to a decrease in sarcopenic state. Thus, understanding the relationship between the gut microbiome and muscle metabolism is crucial for developing new treatments for sarcopenia across age groups.",

    "abstract": "Creatine supplementation is an effective ergogenic aid to augment resistance training and improve intense, short duration, intermittent performance. The effects on endurance performance are less known. The purpose of this brief narrative review is to discuss the potential mechanisms of how creatine can affect endurance performance, defined as large muscle mass activities that are cyclical in nature and are >~3 min in duration, and to highlight specific nuances within the literature. Mechanistically, creatine supplementation elevates skeletal muscle phosphocreatine (PCr) stores facilitating a greater capacity to rapidly resynthesize ATP and buffer hydrogen ion accumulation. When co-ingested with carbohydrates, creatine enhances glycogen resynthesis and content, an important fuel to support high-intensity aerobic exercise. In addition, creatine lowers inflammation and oxidative stress and has the potential to increase mitochondrial biogenesis. In contrast, creatine supplementation increases body mass, which may offset the potential positive effects, particularly in weight-bearing activities. Overall, creatine supplementation increases time to exhaustion during high-intensity endurance activities, likely due to increasing anaerobic work capacity. In terms of time trial performances, results are mixed; however, creatine supplementation appears to be more effective at improving performances that require multiple surges in intensity and/or during end spurts, which are often key race-defining moments. Given creatines ability to enhance anaerobic work capacity and performance through repeated surges in intensity, creatine supplementation may be beneficial for sports, such as cross-country skiing, mountain biking, cycling, triathlon, and for short-duration events where end-spurts are critical for performance, such as rowing, kayaking, and track cycling.",

    "abstract": "Fenugreek extracts possess promising physiological and pharmacological properties in human and animal models. This review aims to provide a scientific and comprehensive analysis of the literature on the effects of fenugreek extracts on muscle performance. An extensive online search was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement guidelines. The main medical and scientific engines were searched for articles from May 1981 to May 2021 to capture all scientific studies focused on the effect of fenugreek on muscle and exercise or sport. Out of 81 studies acquired, six eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included in the qualitative analysis. Four RCTs observed that fenugreek supplementation had significantly improved muscle strength, repetitions to failure (muscle endurance), submaximal performance index, lean body mass, and reduced body fat. Among the remaining two trials, one reported the significant effect of fenugreek extracts on the rate of muscle glycogen resynthesis during post-exercise recovery; however, the other failed to do so. Those two trials were weak, with a minimal sample size (<10). Further, fenugreek glycoside supplementation with sapogenins and saponins reported substantial anabolic and androgenic activity, influencing testosterone levels and muscle performance. It was useful during eight weeks of resistance training without any clinical side effects. Fenugreek with creatine supplementation improved creatine uptake without the necessity of high carbohydrate intake. Hence, fenugreek extracts can be a helpful natural supplement and ergogenic aid for athletes. However, it is better to be aware of doping and liver and kidney damage before using the fenugreek supplement.",

    "abstract": "A ketone body (β-hydroxybutyrate [β-HB]) is used as an energy source in the peripheral tissues. However, the effects of acute β-HB supplementation on different modalities of exercise performance remain unclear. This study aimed to assess the effects of acute β-HB administration on the exercise performance of rats. In study 1, Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into six groups: endurance exercise (EE + PL and EE + KE), resistance exercise (RE + PL and RE + KE), and high-intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE + PL and HIIE + KE) with placebo (PL) or β-HB salt (KE) administration. In study 2, metabolome analysis using capillary electrophoresis mass spectrometry was performed to profile the effects of β-HB salt administration on HIIE-induced metabolic responses in the skeletal and heart muscles. The maximal carrying capacity (rest for 3 min after each ladder climb, while carrying heavy weights until the rats could not climb) in the RE + KE group was higher than that in the RE + PL group. The maximum number of HIIE sessions (a 20-s swimming session with a 10-s rest between sessions, while bearing a weight equivalent to 16% of body weight) in the HIIE + KE group was higher than that in the HIIE + PL group. However, there was no significant difference in the time to exhaustion at 30 m·min -1 between the EE + PL and the EE + KE groups. Metabolome analysis showed that the overall tricarboxylic acid cycle and creatine phosphate levels in the skeletal muscle were higher in the HIIE + KE group than those in the HIIE + PL group. These results indicate that acute β-HB salt administration may accelerate HIIE and RE performance, and the changes in metabolic responses in the skeletal muscle after β-HB salt administration may be involved in the enhancement of HIIE performance.",

Over time creatine has shown beneficial effects in several human disease conditions. This review aims to summarise the current evidence for creatine supplementation in advanced chronic liver disease and its complications, primarily in sarcopenic cirrhotic patients, because this condition is known to be associated with poor prognosis and outcomes. Although creatine supplementation in chronic liver disease seems to be barely investigated and not studied in human patients, its potential efficacy on chronic liver disease is indirectly highlighted in animal models of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, bringing beneficial effects in the fatty liver. Similarly, encephalopathy and fatigue seem to have beneficial effects. Creatine supplementation has demonstrated effects in sarcopenia in the elderly with and without resistance training suggesting a potential role in improving this condition in patients with advanced chronic liver disease. Creatine supplementation could address several critical points of chronic liver disease and its complications. Further studies are needed to support the clinical burden of this hypothesis.",

    "abstract": "Background: Adequate animal-based protein intake can attenuate exercise induced-muscle damage (EIMD) in young adults. We examined the effects of 13 days plant-based (pea) protein supplementation compared to whey protein and placebo on EIMD in active older adults. Methods: 47 Physically active older adults (60+ years) were randomly allocated to the following groups: (I) whey protein (25 g/day), (II) pea protein (25 g/day) or (III) iso-caloric placebo. Blood concentrations of creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and skeletal muscle mass, muscle strength and muscle soreness were measured prior to and 24 h, 48 h and 72 h after a long-distance walking bout (20−30 km). Results: Participants walked 20−30 km and 2 dropped out, leaving n = 15 per subgroup. The whey group showed a significant attenuation of the increase in EIMD at 24 h post-exercise compared to the pea and placebo group (CK concentration: 175 ± 90 versus 300 ± 309 versus 330 ± 165, p = p < 0.001). No differences in LDH levels, muscle strength, skeletal muscle mass and muscle soreness were observed across groups (all p-values > 0.05). Conclusions: Thirteen days of pea protein supplementation (25 g/day) does not attenuate EIMD in older adults following a single bout of prolonged walking exercise, whereas the whey protein supplementation group showed significantly lower post-exercise CK concentrations.",

    "abstract": "Military activities often involve high-intensity exercise that can disrupt antioxidant capacity. We investigated the effects of oregano supplementation on muscle damage, oxidative stress, and plasma antioxidant markers of soldiers performing the army combat readiness test (ACRT). Twenty-four healthy male soldiers (age: 24 ± 3 years, height: 167 ± 14 cm, mass: 66 ± 3 kg) were randomized into a placebo group (n = 12) or an oregano supplementation group (n = 12). The participants consumed a capsule containing 500 mg Origanum vulgare immediately after completing the ACRT. Blood sampling was taken before exercise, immediately after exercise, and 60 and 120 min after oregano consumption. Plasma levels of creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) were measured at the four time points. The time × group interactions were found for CK (p < 0.0001, d = 3.64), LDH (p < 0.0001, d = 1.64), MDA (p < 0.0001, d = 9.94), SOD (p < 0.0001, d = 1.88), TAC (p < 0.0001, d = 5.68) and GPX (p < 0.0001, d = 2.38). In all variables, the difference between placebo and oregano groups were significant at 60 (p < 0.0001) and 120 (p < 0.0001) minutes after ACRT test. The main effect of time was also significant for all the variables (p < 0.0001). Our results suggest that oregano supplementation has the potential to reduce muscle damage and increase oxidative capacity following ACRT. Supplementation with oregano may serve as a dietary strategy to increase preparedness and promote recovery in military recruits.",

    "abstract": "Cancer cachexia is a multifactorial syndrome defined by progressive loss of body weight with specific depletion of skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. Since there are no FDA-approved drugs that are available, nutritional intervention is recommended as a supporting therapy. Creatine supplementation has an ergogenic effect in various types of sports training, but the regulatory effects of creatine supplementation in cancer cachexia remain unknown. In this study, we investigated the impact of creatine supplementation on cachectic weight loss and muscle loss protection in a tumor-bearing cachectic mouse model, and the underlying molecular mechanism of body weight protection was further assessed. We observed decreased serum creatine levels in patients with cancer cachexia, and the creatine content in skeletal muscle was also significantly decreased in cachectic skeletal muscle in the C26 tumor-bearing mouse model. Creatine supplementation protected against cancer cachexia-associated body weight loss and muscle wasting and induced greater improvements in grip strength. Mechanistically, creatine treatment altered the dysfunction and morphological abnormalities of mitochondria, thus protecting against cachectic muscle wasting by inhibiting the abnormal overactivation of the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) and autophagic lysosomal system (ALS). In addition, electron microscopy revealed that creatine supplementation alleviated the observed increase in the percentage of damaged mitochondria in C26 mice, indicating that nutritional intervention with creatine supplementation effectively counteracts mitochondrial dysfunction to mitigate muscle loss in cancer cachexia. These results uncover a previously uncharacterized role for creatine in cachectic muscle wasting by modulating cellular energy metabolism to reduce the level of muscle cell atrophy.",

    "abstract": "Carnosine is a performance-enhancing food supplement with a potential to modulate muscle energy metabolism and toxic metabolites disposal. In this study we explored interrelations between carnosine supplementation (2 g/day, 12 weeks) induced effects on carnosine muscle loading and parallel changes in (i) muscle energy metabolism, (ii) serum albumin glycation and (iii) reactive carbonyl species sequestering in twelve (M/F=10/2) sedentary, overweight-to-obese (BMI: 30.0+/-2.7 kg/m2) adults (40.1+/-6.2 years). Muscle carnosine concentration (Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; 1H-MRS), dynamics of muscle energy metabolism (Phosphorus Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; 31P-MRS), body composition (Magnetic Resonance Imaging; MRI), resting energy expenditure (indirect calorimetry), glucose tolerance (oGTT), habitual physical activity (accelerometers), serum carnosine and carnosinase-1 content/activity (ELISA), albumin glycation, urinary carnosine and carnosine-propanal concentration (mass spectrometry) were measured. Supplementation-induced increase in muscle carnosine was paralleled by improved dynamics of muscle post-exercise phosphocreatine recovery, decreased serum albumin glycation and enhanced urinary carnosine-propanal excretion (all p<0.05). Magnitude of supplementation-induced muscle carnosine accumulation was higher in individuals with lower baseline muscle carnosine, who had lower BMI, higher physical activity level, lower resting intramuscular pH, but similar muscle mass and dietary protein preference. Level of supplementation-induced increase in muscle carnosine correlated with reduction of protein glycation, increase in reactive carbonyl species sequestering, and acceleration of muscle post-exercise phosphocreatine recovery.",

    "abstract": "Moderate altitudes carry physiological and metabolic changes that can dampen exercise performance. Fortunately, these changes can be modulated by an optimal nutritional intervention. This case study represents the first nutritional intervention of a moderate altitude athlete. These results may help to establish well-designed nutritional guidelines for moderate altitude sports athletes. This case study examined the effects of a 11-week nutritional intervention on body composition, muscle strength, cardiorespiratory fitness, resting and exercise nutrient oxidation, and subjective sleep quality, in a male high-level moderate altitude athlete with a very light non-exercise activity thermogenesis. During the 11-week of nutritional intervention, 2800-3500 kcal/day, 6.8-8.9 g/kg/day of carbohydrates, 1.2-1.7 g/kg/day of protein, and 1-2.5 g/kg/day of fat were prescribed. Different specific considerations were also included, such as: iron supplementation, antioxidants increment in different phases, and ergogenic aids (i.e. creatine and beta-alanine). Our results demonstrated a decrease in adiposity and an increase in fat-free mass. In parallel, the athlete improved muscle strength, and therefore endurance adaptations after a maximal effort test (i.e. enhancement of the heart rate recovery). After the intervention, the athlete not only increased the carbohydrate oxidation during exercise and resting conditions but also improved his subjective sleep quality. Our results suggest that a nutritional intervention based on the endurance nutritional recommendations and adapted to the altitude physiological peculiarities can induce body re-composition, improve physiological adaptations to effort, and upgrade the substrate oxidation in a moderate altitude high-level athletes.",

    "abstract": "Poor physical function is highly prevalent with aging, and strongly associated with D3-creatine muscle mass/weight. Using metabolomics, we previously identified several triglycerides consisting mostly of polyunsaturated fatty acids that were higher in older adults with good mobility. Here, we sought to further investigate polyunsaturated fatty-acid-related metabolites, i.e., oxylipins, and their associations with D3-creatine muscle mass/weight, gait speed, grip strength, and the Short Physical Performance Battery among 463 older men from the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Study (MrOS). Oxylipins were measured in fasting serum using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Muscle mass was estimated using D3-creatine dilution and adjusted for body size. We used linear regression to determine oxylipins associated with D3-creatine muscle mass/weight and physical performance, while adjusting for age, education, physical activity, Western dietary pattern, fish oil supplementation, and multiple comparisons. Among 42 oxylipins, none were associated with grip strength and 3 were associated with the Short Physical Performance Battery. In contrast, 18 and 17 oxylipins were associated with D3-creatine muscle mass/weight and gait speed, respectively. A subset of associations between oxylipins and gait speed were partially attenuated by D3-creatine muscle mass/weight. Higher levels of fatty acid alcohol and ketone oxylipins tended to be most strongly associated with gait speed and D3-creatine muscle mass/weight, potentially reflecting anti-inflammatory activity from these select oxylipins in MrOS older men.",

    "abstract": "The present study aimed to assess the changes in muscle strength and plasma metabolites in athletes with β-glucan supplementation. A total of 29 athletes who met the inclusion criteria were recruited for this study (ChiCTR2200058091) and were randomly divided into a placebo group (n = 14) and β-glucan group (n = 15). During the trial, the experimental group received β-glucan supplementation (2 g/d β-glucan) for 4 weeks and the control group received an equal dose of placebo supplementation (0 g/d β-glucan), with both groups maintaining their regular diet and exercise habits during the trial. The athletes’ exercise performance, muscle strength, and plasma metabolome changes were analyzed after 4 weeks of β-glucan supplementation. The results showed a significant increase in mean grip strength (kg), right hand grip strength (kg), left triceps strength (kg), and upper limb muscle mass (kg) in the experimental group after the 4-week intervention compared to the preintervention period (p < 0.05). A comparison of the difference between the two groups after the intervention showed that there were significant differences between the control group and the experimental group in mean grip strength (kg) and right-hand grip strength (kg) (p < 0.05). Athletes in the experimental group showed significant improvements in 1 min double rocking jump (pcs), VO2max (ml/kg-min) (p < 0.05). The β-glucan intake increased the creatine-related pathway metabolites in plasma. Overall, these results suggest that 4 weeks of β-glucan supplementation can improve muscle strength in athletes, with the potential to increase aerobic endurance and enhance immune function, possibly by affecting creatine-related pathways.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this narrative review is to discuss the evidence on exercise for fall, fracture and sarcopenia prevention, including evidence that aligns with the specificity and progressive overload principles used in exercise physiology, implementation strategies and future research priorities. We also provide a brief discussion of the influence of protein intake and creatine supplementation as potential effect modifiers. We prioritized evidence from randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews. Resistance training can improve muscle mass, muscle strength and a variety of physical performance measures in older adults. Resistance training may also prevent bone loss or increase bone mass, although whether it needs to be done in combination with impact exercise to be effective is less clear, because many studies use multicomponent interventions. Exercise programs prevent falls, and subgroup and network meta-analyses suggest an emphasis on balance and functional training, or specifically, anticipatory control, dynamic stability, functional stability limits, reactive control and flexibility, to maximize efficacy. Resistance training for major muscle groups at a 6-12 repetitions maximum intensity, and challenging balance exercises should be performed at least twice weekly. Choose resistance training exercises aligned with patient goals or movements done during daily activities (task specificity), alongside balance exercises tailored to ability and aspects of balance that need improvement. Progress the volume, level of difficulty or other aspects to see continuous improvement (progressive overload). A critical future priority will be to address implementation barriers and facilitators to enhance uptake and adherence.",

    "abstract": "Skeletal muscle losses (both quantitative and qualitative) and the consequent risk of sarcopenia are important issues in people living with HIV (PLWH), even when treated with antiretroviral therapies (ART). We aimed to conduct a systematic review (SR) investigating the effects of dietary interventions with proteins, amino acids, and other nitrogenated compounds on the skeletal muscle of PLWH. We searched the published literature until August 24th, 2020, including clinical trials predominantly with AIDS-free PLWH treated with ART. From the 82 studies initially selected, 75 were excluded for the following reasons: nutritional interventions different from nitrogenated compounds; non-nutritional interventions; lack of information on body composition; and studies with most participants with AIDS. From the publications included (n = 7), the majority were performed with small and heterogeneous samples. None of the studies included any new-generation ART or pre- or post-exposition drugs. Two studies found benefits of supplementation on muscle mass; one was performed in a very unfavorable socioeconomic setting, and the supplementation was based on food-derived substances. The other study supplemented creatine, and its benefits were found only when combined with physical exercise training and only by one of the methods of body composition analysis (DXA). Our results showed that nutritional interventions with proteins, amino acids, or other nitrogenated compounds could not improve the skeletal muscle mass in PLWH. Further studies are needed, with bigger sample sizes and more precise control of ART schemes. PROSPERO registration number CRD42019139981.",

    "abstract": "Currently, injectable hydrogels with multiple desired merits that could modulate specific pathological events have emerged as a revolutionary therapeutic strategy for myocardial infarction (MI) treatment. Despite the promising outcomes of injectable hydrogels with antioxidant, conductivity, and pro-angiogenesis therapeutic efficacy, there are very limited reports on the fabrication of injectable hydrogels integrating the above merits to comprehensively address the multifaceted challenges of MI treatment, particularly using a simplified fabrication methodology. In this study, 2,3,4-trihydroxybenzaldehyde and ferric iron coordination compound was employed as a versatile building block for the supramolecular multifunctional hydrogel. This approach facilitated crosslinking of the hydrogel network via dynamic Schiff base, simultaneously endowing the hydrogel with injectability and antioxidant properties, while also allowing for the loading of the pro-angiogenic agent L-arginine through dynamic covalent bonding. Aniline tetramer grafted gelatin and adipic dihydrazide modified hyaluronic acid were combined with the coordination compound to construct a biodegradable hydrogel with conductivity. After being injected into the infarcted myocardium, this hydrogel could effectively ameliorate the pathologic progression of MI and improve cardiac function, as manifested by significantly reduced infarcted area and collagen deposition, enhanced cardiomyocyte viability and electrical coupling, as well as improved angiogenesis. The study reports, for the first time, an injectable hydrogel integrating antioxidant, conductivity, and pro-angiogenesis via a facile method that could comprehensively target key pathologic events in MI and demonstrate appreciable therapeutic efficacy in MI treatment.",

    "abstract": "The metabolic hyperactivity of tumor cells demands a substantial amount of energy and molecules to build new cells and expand the tumor, diverting these resources from healthy cells. Amino acids (AAs) are the only totipotent and essential molecules for protein construction. Previous in vitro studies in human and murine cancer cells, along with in vivo studies in mice, have shown that an excess of essential amino acids (EAAs) exerts an inhibitory effect on tumor proliferation by promoting apoptosis and autophagy. In this study, both in vitro and in vivo, we evaluated whether a mixture based on EAA can influence the development of human colon cancer (HCT116). To this end, in vitro, we assessed the proliferation of HCT116 cells treated with a special mix of EAA. In vivo, immunosuppressed athymic nude mice, injected with HCT116 cells subcutaneously (s.c.) or intraperitoneally (i.p.), were given a modified EAAs-rich diet (EAARD) compared to the standard laboratory diet (StD). In vitro data showed that the EAA mix impairs cancer growth by inducing apoptosis and autophagy. In vivo, the results demonstrated that EAARD-fed mice developed s.c. tumors significantly smaller than those of StD-fed mice (total mass 3.24 vs. 6.09 g, respectively). Mice injected i.p. and fed with EAARD showed a smaller and more limited number of intra-peritoneal tumors than StD-fed mice (total mass 0.79 vs. 4.77 g, respectively). EAAs prevents the growth of HCT116 cells by inducing autophagy and apoptosis, increasing endoplasmic reticulum stress, and inhibiting inflammation and neo-vascularization. In addition, the EAARD-fed mice, maintained muscle mass and white and brown adipose tissues. A diet with an excess of EAAs affects the survival and proliferative capacity of human colon cancer cells, maintaining anabolic stimuli in muscular cells.",

    "title": "Insect protein: the next frontier in bodybuilding nutrition.",
    "abstract": "Protein is a crucial macronutrient for muscle growth, repair, and optimal performance. Conventional sources such as whey and casein dominate the nutrition industry; however, concerns about their environmental impact, resource-intensive production, and digestibility necessitate the exploration of alternative protein sources. Edible insects are a highly sustainable and nutrient-dense option, delivering complete proteins with all essential amino acids, a high bioavailability of micronutrients, and favorable digestion kinetics. Comparative studies suggest that insect-derived proteins exhibit protein efficiency ratios and digestibility scores comparable to those of traditional proteins, making them viable for muscle synthesis and post-exercise recovery. However, several challenges hinder the widespread adoption of insect proteins as supplements. The bioactive peptides and specific metabolic pathways governing insect protein absorption remain underexplored compared to extensively studied whey proteins. Additionally, allergenicity profiles and potential immunogenic responses require rigorous evaluation to ensure product safety. Consumer reluctance, shaped by cultural biases and limited exposure, further impedes market integration in the region. Moreover, regulatory inconsistencies across global food safety frameworks complicate the commercialization process. Additionally, evaluating their role in muscle protein synthesis, endurance enhancement, and post-exercise recovery will determine their efficacy as sustainable alternatives in strength- and muscle-building regimens. This review explores the nutritional composition of edible insects, their environmental benefits, and their potential health risks. It also compares insect proteins with traditional sources, examines their role in muscle growth, highlights innovative insect-based products, and discusses consumer acceptance and market perspectives. © 2025 Society of Chemical Industry.",

    "title": "Invited review: Unlocking growth and development potential in dairy calves through precision protein feeding.",
    "abstract": "Optimizing protein nutrition is pivotal for enhancing growth, metabolic efficiency, and long-term productivity of dairy calves. This review summarizes current research on precision protein feeding based on the NASEM (2021) model, which aligns MP and ME with calf developmental stages to optimize nutrient utilization. In the preweaning phase, the CP requirement of Holstein calves (<125 kg BW) increases with increasing ADG, with a 50-kg calf requiring 102 g of CP (18.2% DMI) for 0.2 kg/d ADG and 315 g of CP (25.5% DMI) for 1.0 kg/d ADG, with ME intake increasing from 2.56 to 5.66 Mcal/d. The review underscores the importance of adjusting the CP-to-ME ratio; adequate supply of limiting AA such as Lys, Met, and Thr; and a balanced ratio of RDP and RUP to optimize growth and metabolism. Amino acids are essential for muscle development, immune response, and enzyme function. Protein intake in the preweaning phase improves growth performance, weight gain, and feed efficiency, although excess protein in the diet can reduce overall growth efficiency. The balance between RDP and RUP is critical for microbial protein synthesis and nitrogen retention, with RDP becoming the dominant protein source after weaning due to increased reliance on microbial protein. Furthermore, macronutrient-specific adjustments in milk replacers, such as the addition of protein, fat, or lactose, lead to different metabolic responses, with protein primarily supporting lean tissue building, whereas fat and lactose promote energy storage. These findings emphasize the need for precise nutritional strategies that consider protein quality and AA availability to ensure optimal growth and metabolic efficiency. Furthermore, protein levels in calf starter diets, ideally between 20% and 23% CP (DM basis), lead to optimal growth, especially when combined with moderate to high milk feeding, although higher protein levels are not always growth promoting, highlighting the need for precise nutritional adjustments according to the developmental needs of the calf. For growing heifers, protein nutrition after weaning continues to be a critical factor in optimizing growth, efficiency, and later lactation performance. Stage-specific adjustments to the balance between RDP and RUP are important to support microbial protein synthesis and nitrogen retention, with RDP becoming the dominant protein source as heifers mature and transition to a more energy-driven fat deposition phase. These findings are critical for refining protein and energy utilization strategies, optimizing calf development, and supporting long-term lactation performance. In summary, this review provides insights into the optimal protein feeding strategies to improve calf growth and metabolic efficiency in the pre- and postweaning phases.",

    "abstract": "In humans, defects in leucine catabolism cause a variety of inborn errors in metabolism. Here, we use Caenorhabditis elegans to investigate the impact of mutations in mccc-1, an enzyme that functions in leucine breakdown. Through untargeted metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses we find extensive metabolic rewiring that helps to detoxify leucine breakdown intermediates via conversion into previously undescribed metabolites and to synthesize mevalonate, an essential metabolite. We also find that the leucine breakdown product 3,3-hydroxymethylbutyrate (HMB), commonly used as a human muscle-building supplement, is toxic to C. elegans and that bacteria modulate this toxicity. Unbiased genetic screens revealed interactions between the host and microbe, where components of bacterial pyrimidine biosynthesis mitigate HMB toxicity. Finally, upregulated ketone body metabolism genes in mccc-1 mutants provide an alternative route for biosynthesis of the mevalonate precursor 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA. Our work demonstrates that a complex host-bacteria interplay rewires metabolism to allow host survival when leucine catabolism is perturbed.",

    "title": "Critical Role of Mitochondrial Fatty Acid Metabolism in Normal Cell Function and Pathological Conditions.",
    "abstract": "There is a \"popular\" belief that a fat-free diet is beneficial, supported by the scientific dogma indicating that high levels of fatty acids promote many pathological metabolic, cardiovascular, and neurodegenerative conditions. This dogma pressured scientists not to recognize the essential role of fatty acids in cellular metabolism and focus on the detrimental effects of fatty acids. In this work, we critically review several decades of studies and recent publications supporting the critical role of mitochondrial fatty acid metabolism in cellular homeostasis and many pathological conditions. Fatty acids are the primary fuel source and essential cell membrane building blocks from the origin of life. The essential cell membranes phospholipids were evolutionarily preserved from the earlier bacteria in human subjects. In the past century, the discovery of fatty acid metabolism was superseded by the epidemic growth of metabolic conditions and cardiovascular diseases. The association of fatty acids and pathological conditions is not due to their \"harmful\" effects but rather the result of impaired fatty acid metabolism and abnormal lifestyle. Mitochondrial dysfunction is linked to impaired metabolism and drives multiple pathological conditions. Despite metabolic flexibility, the loss of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation cannot be fully compensated for by other sources of mitochondrial substrates, such as carbohydrates and amino acids, resulting in a pathogenic accumulation of long-chain fatty acids and a deficiency of medium-chain fatty acids. Despite popular belief, mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation is essential not only for energy-demanding organs such as the heart, skeletal muscle, and kidneys but also for metabolically \"inactive\" organs such as endothelial and epithelial cells. Recent studies indicate that the accumulation of long-chain fatty acids in specific organs and tissues support the impaired fatty acid oxidation in cell- and tissue-specific fashion. This work, therefore, provides a basis to challenge these established dogmas and articulate the need for a paradigm shift from the \"pathogenic\" role of fatty acids to the critical role of fatty acid oxidation. This is important to define the causative role of impaired mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation in specific pathological conditions and develop novel therapeutic approaches targeting mitochondrial fatty acid metabolism.",

    "title": "Non-Pharmacological Strategies for Managing Sarcopenia in Chronic Diseases.",
    "abstract": "This article focuses on a range of non-pharmacological strategies for managing sarcopenia in chronic diseases, including exercise, dietary supplements, traditional Chinese exercise, intestinal microecology, and rehabilitation therapies for individuals with limited limb movement. By analyzing multiple studies, the article aims to summarize the available evidence to manage sarcopenia in individuals with chronic diseases. The results strongly emphasize the role of resistance training in addressing chronic diseases and secondary sarcopenia. Maintaining the appropriate frequency and intensity of resistance training can help prevent muscle atrophy and effectively reduce inflammation. Although aerobic exercise has limited ability to improve skeletal muscle mass, it does have some positive effects on physical function. Building upon this, the article explores the potential benefits of combined training approaches, highlighting their helpfulness for overall quality of life. Additionally, the article also highlights the importance of dietary supplements in combating muscle atrophy in chronic diseases. It focuses on the importance of protein intake, supplements rich in essential amino acids and omega-3, as well as sufficient vitamin D to prevent muscle atrophy. Combining exercise with dietary supplements appears to be an effective strategy for preventing sarcopenia, although the optimal dosage and type of supplement remain unclear. Furthermore, the article explores the potential benefits of intestinal microecology in sarcopenia. Probiotics, prebiotics, and bacterial products are suggested as new treatment options for sarcopenia. Additionally, emerging therapies such as whole body vibration training, blood flow restriction, and electrical stimulation show promise in treating sarcopenia with limited limb movement. Overall, this article provides valuable insights into non-pharmacological strategies for managing sarcopenia in individuals with chronic diseases. It emphasizes the importance of a holistic and integrated approach that incorporates exercise, nutrition, and multidisciplinary interventions, which have the potential to promote health in the elderly population. Future research should prioritize high-quality randomized controlled trials and utilize wearable devices, smartphone applications, and other advanced surveillance methods to investigate the most effective intervention strategies for sarcopenia associated with different chronic diseases.",

    "abstract": "The branched chain amino acids (BCAA) leucine, isoleucine, and valine are essential nutrients that have been associated with diabetes, cancers, and cardiovascular diseases. Observational studies suggest that BCAAs exert homogeneous phenotypic effects, but these findings are inconsistent with results from experimental human and animal studies. Hypothesizing that inconsistencies between observational and experimental BCAA studies reflect bias from shared lifestyle and genetic factors in observational studies, we used data from the UK Biobank and applied multivariable Mendelian randomization causal inference methods designed to address these biases. In n = 97,469 participants of European ancestry (mean age = 56.7 years; 54.1% female), we estimate distinct and often opposing total causal effects for each BCAA. For example, of the 117 phenotypes with evidence of a statistically significant total causal effect for at least one BCAA, almost half (44%, n = 52) are associated with only one BCAA. These 52 associations include total causal effects of valine on diabetic eye disease [odds ratio = 1.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.31, 1.76], valine on albuminuria (odds ratio = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.08, 1.20), and isoleucine on angina (odds ratio = 1.17, 95% CI = 1.31, 1.76). Our results suggest that the observational literature provides a flawed picture of BCAA phenotypic effects that is inconsistent with experimental studies and could mislead efforts developing novel therapeutics. More broadly, these findings motivate the development and application of causal inference approaches that enable 'omics studies conducted in observational settings to account for the biasing effects of shared genetic and lifestyle factors. The three branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) leucine, isoleucine, and valine are important building blocks of muscle proteins that are obtained from the diet. Many studies in human populations have examined whether BCAAs affect health and disease. These human studies report results that are inconsistent with results from highly controlled animal studies. Because interest in the therapeutic targeting of BCAAs is growing, we wanted to better understand these discrepancies. Briefly, we used data from a large database that captured many diseases (e.g., cardiovascular disease, cancers, and respiratory disease) and new statistical methods. Our results showed that discrepancies between human studies and animal studies may reflect errors in the ways human studies were designed and conducted. As a result, these human studies may provide a flawed picture of BCAA effects that could mislead efforts developing novel therapeutics.",

    "title": "Dysregulated autophagy: A key player in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes and its complications.",
    "abstract": "Autophagy is essential in regulating the turnover of macromolecules via removing damaged organelles, misfolded proteins in various tissues, including liver, skeletal muscles, and adipose tissue to maintain the cellular homeostasis. In these tissues, a specific type of autophagy maintains the accumulation of lipid droplets which is directly related to obesity and the development of insulin resistance. It appears to play a protective role in a normal physiological environment by eliminating the invading pathogens, protein aggregates, and damaged organelles and generating energy and new building blocks by recycling the cellular components. Ageing is also a crucial modulator of autophagy process. During stress conditions involving nutrient deficiency, lipids excess, hypoxia etc., autophagy serves as a pro-survival mechanism by recycling the free amino acids to maintain the synthesis of proteins. The dysregulated autophagy has been found in several ageing associated diseases including type 2 diabetes (T2DM), cancer, and neurodegenerative disorders. So, targeting autophagy can be a promising therapeutic strategy against the progression to diabetes related complications. Our article provides a comprehensive outline of understanding of the autophagy process, including its types, mechanisms, regulation, and role in the pathophysiology of T2DM and related complications. We also explored the significance of autophagy in the homeostasis of β-cells, insulin resistance (IR), clearance of protein aggregates such as islet amyloid polypeptide, and various insulin-sensitive tissues. This will further pave the way for developing novel therapeutic strategies for diabetes-related complications.",

    "title": "Structural insights into actin isoforms.",
    "abstract": "Actin isoforms organize into distinct networks that are essential for the normal function of eukaryotic cells. Despite a high level of sequence and structure conservation, subtle differences in their design principles determine the interaction with myosin motors and actin-binding proteins. Therefore, identifying how the structure of actin isoforms relates to function is important for our understanding of normal cytoskeletal physiology. Here, we report the high-resolution structures of filamentous skeletal muscle α-actin (3.37 Å), cardiac muscle α-actin (3.07 Å), ß-actin (2.99 Å), and γ-actin (3.38 Å) in the Mg The protein actin is important for many fundamental processes in biology, from contracting muscle to dividing a cell in two. As actin is involved in such a variety of roles, human cells have slightly different versions of the protein, known as isoforms. For example, alpha-actin is vital for contracting muscle, while beta- and gamma-actin drive cellular processes in non-muscle cells. In order to carry out its various functions, actin interacts with many other proteins inside the cell, such as myosin motors which power muscle contraction. These interactions rely on the precise chain of building blocks, known as amino acids, that make up the actin isoforms; even subtle alterations in this sequence can influence the behavior of the protein. However, it is not clear how differences in the amino acid sequence of the actin isoforms impact actin’s interactions with other proteins. Arora et al. addressed this by studying the structure of four human actin isoforms using a technique called cryo-electron microscopy, where the proteins are flash-frozen and bombarded with electrons. These experiments showed where differences between the amino acid chains of each isoform were located in the protein. Arora et al. then compared their structures with previous work showing the structure of actin bound to myosin. This revealed that the tail-end of the protein (known as the N-terminus) differed in shape between the four isoforms, and this variation may influence how actin binds to others proteins in the cell. These results are an important foundation for further work on actin and how it interacts with other proteins. The structures could help researchers design new tools that can be used to target specific isoforms of actin in different types of laboratory experiments.",

    "abstract": "In response to muscle injury, muscle stem cells are stimulated by environmental signals to integrate into damaged tissue to mediate regeneration. L-leucine (L-leu), a branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) that belongs to the essential amino acids (AAs) of the animal, has gained global interest on account of its muscle-building and regenerating effects. The present study was designed to investigate the impact of L-leu exposure to promote the proliferation of equine skeletal muscle satellite cells (SCs) on the regulation of RNA networks, including mRNA, long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), covalently closed circular RNA (circRNA), and microRNA (miRNA) in skeletal muscles. Equine SCs were used as a cell model and cultured in different concentrations of L-leu medium. The cell proliferation assay found that the optimal concentration of L-leu was 2 mM, so we selected cells cultured with L-leu concentrations of 0 mM and 2 mM for whole-transcriptiome sequencing, respectively. By high-throughput sequencing analysis, 2470 differentially expressed mRNAs (dif-mRNAs), 363 differentially expressed lncRNAs (dif-lncRNAs), 634 differentially expressed circRNAs (dif-circRNAs), and 49 differentially expressed miRNAs (dif-miRNAs) were significantly altered in equine SCs treated with L-leu. To identify the function of autoimmunity and anti-inflammatory responses after L-leu exposure, enrichment analysis was conducted on those differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to lncRNA, circRNA, and miRNA. The hub genes were selected from PPI Network, including ACACB, HMGCR, IDI1, HAO1, SHMT2, PSPH, PSAT1, ASS1, PHGDH, MTHFD2, and DPYD, and were further identified as candidate biomarkers to regulate the L-leu-induced proliferation of equine SCs. The up-regulated novel 699_star, down-regulated novel 170_star, and novel 360_mature were significantly involved in the competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) complex network. The hub genes involved in cell metabolism and dif-miRNAs may play fundamental roles in the L-leu-induced proliferation of equine SCs. Our findings suggested that the potential network regulation of miRNAs, circ-RNAs, lncRNAs, and mRNAs plays an important role in the proliferation of equine SCs, so as to build up new perspectives on improving equine performance and treatment strategies for the muscle injuries of horses.",

Eighteen hours fasted rats were orally administered of tryptophan or leucine at a dose of 135 mg/100 g body weight by gavage and then sacrificed 1 h after administration. The effects of tryptophan and leucine on the rate of protein synthesis were evaluated by the surface sensing of translation (SUnSET) method. We also examined the ability of tryptophan to induce activation of the mTOR pathway by measuring phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and S6K1. Oral administration of tryptophan led to a stimulation of the rate of protein synthesis concomitant with activation of mTOR pathway in the liver, but not in skeletal muscle. We also investigated the sensitivity of liver protein synthesis to tryptophan administration. The half-maximal effective doses (ED50) of tryptophan in stimulating 4E-BP1 and S6K1 phosphorylation were both about 60% of daily intake. The effect of tryptophan on hepatic protein synthesis was similar to that of leucine on muscle protein synthesis, and the sensitivity of liver protein synthesis to tryptophan administration appeared to be almost the same or slightly lower than that of muscle protein synthesis to leucine administration.",

    "abstract": "Food proteins provide amino acids (AAs) and serve as building blocks of all vital organs, muscles, hormones, and biological fluids such as blood. Eggs are known as a good source of protein. This study compared the protein quality of bird eggs (raw and boiled), using their AA scores since some individuals consume raw eggs for various reasons.  The Guinea fowl egg had the highest total amino acid score (TAAS) of 0.92. The other scores ranged as follows: 0.82 (quail) >0.81 (turkey) >0.75 (exotic chicken), and the lowest score was 0.65 (local chicken). The least scores were phenylalanine: 0.34 (exotic chicken), phenylalanine and serine: 0.36 (local chicken), leucine and aspartic acid: 0.41 (turkey), methionine: 0.31 (quail), and glutamic acid: 0.33 (guinea fowl). Also, guinea fowl egg had the highest total essential amino acid (TEAA) (49.6 g/100 g protein), i.e., % TEAA (55.1%), while exotic chicken egg had the lowest (41.1%), but the highest % NEAA (58.9%). Guinea fowl eggs had the highest EAA and TAA content. Its consumption should particularly be encouraged for children as this can significantly reduce the risk of protein-energy malnutrition and prevent protein deficiencies.",

However, the structural requirements of IRW, especially the significance of each amino acid residue of IRW, is unknown. The study was aimed to investigate the structure and activity relationships of IRW in TNF-α induced insulin resistance L6 cells. The peptides were designed to determine the significance of individual amino acids in IRW using alanine scanning (replacing one amino acid at one time), the order of the peptide sequence and the constituting elements of IRW. Among the tested peptides and amino acids, only IRA and IR showed the same effects as that of IRW: enhanced glucose uptake, improvement in the impaired insulin signaling pathway and increased glucose transporter protein 4 (GLUT4) translocation in TNF-α treated L6 myotubes. This study demonstrated that C-terminal W is not essential to the activity of IRW. Further study is necessary to establish if IR and IRA show similar effects to that of IRW ",

    "abstract": "Creatine is an important energy metabolite that is concentrated in tissues such as the muscles and brain. Creatine is reversibly converted to creatine phosphate through a reaction with ATP or ADP, which is catalyzed by the enzyme creatine kinase. Dietary supplementation with relatively large amounts of creatine monohydrate has been proven as an effective sports supplement that can enhances athletic performance during acute high-energy demand physical activity. Some side effects have been reported with creatine monohydrate supplementation, which have stimulated research into new potential molecules that could be used as supplements to potentially provide bioavailable creatine. Recently, a popular supplement, creatyl-l-leucine, has been proposed as a potential dietary ingredient that may potentially provide bioavailable creatine. This study tests whether creatyl-l-leucine is a bioavailable compound and determines whether it can furnish creatine as a dietary supplement. Rats were deprived of dietary creatine for a period of two weeks and then given one of three treatments: a control AIN-93G creatine-free diet, AIN-93G supplemented with creatine monohydrate or AIN-93G with an equimolar amount of creatyl-l-leucine supplement in the diet for one week. When compared to the control and the creatine monohydrate-supplemented diet, creatyl-l-leucine supplementation resulted in no bioaccumulation of either creatyl-l-leucine or creatine in tissue.",

    "abstract": "As a key macronutrient and source of essential macromolecules, dietary protein plays a significant role in health. For many years, protein-rich diets have been recommended as healthy due to the satiety-inducing and muscle-building effects of protein, as well as the ability of protein calories to displace allegedly unhealthy calories from fats and carbohydrates. However, clinical studies find that consumption of dietary protein is associated with an increased risk of multiple diseases, especially diabetes, while studies in rodents have demonstrated that protein restriction can promote metabolic health and even lifespan. Emerging evidence suggests that the effects of dietary protein on health and longevity are not mediated simply by protein quantity but are instead mediated by protein quality - the specific amino acid composition of the diet. Here, we discuss how dietary protein and specific amino acids including methionine, the branched chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, and valine), tryptophan and glycine regulate metabolic health, healthspan, and aging, with attention to the specific molecular mechanisms that may participate in these effects. Finally, we discuss the potential applicability of these findings to promoting healthy aging in humans.",

    "title": "Role of L-Arginine in Nitric Oxide Synthesis and Health in Humans.",
    "abstract": "As a functional amino acid (AA), L-arginine (Arg) serves not only as a building block of protein but also as an essential substrate for the synthesis of nitric oxide (NO), creatine, polyamines, homoarginine, and agmatine in mammals (including humans). NO (a major vasodilator) increases blood flow to tissues. Arg and its metabolites play important roles in metabolism and physiology. Arg is required to maintain the urea cycle in the active state to detoxify ammonia. This AA also activates cellular mechanistic target of rapamycin (MTOR) and focal adhesion kinase cell signaling pathways in mammals, thereby stimulating protein synthesis, inhibiting autophagy and proteolysis, enhancing cell migration and wound healing, promoting spermatogenesis and sperm quality, improving conceptus survival and growth, and augmenting the production of milk proteins. Although Arg is formed de novo from glutamine/glutamate and proline in humans, these synthetic pathways do not provide sufficient Arg in infants or adults. Thus, humans and other animals do have dietary needs of Arg for optimal growth, development, lactation, and fertility. Much evidence shows that oral administration of Arg within the physiological range can confer health benefits to both men and women by increasing NO synthesis and thus blood flow in tissues (e.g., skeletal muscle and the corpora cavernosa of the penis). NO is a vasodilator, a neurotransmitter, a regulator of nutrient metabolism, and a killer of bacteria, fungi, parasites, and viruses [including coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus causing COVID-19). Thus, Arg supplementation can enhance immunity, anti-infectious, and anti-oxidative responses, fertility, wound healing, ammonia detoxification, nutrient digestion and absorption, lean tissue mass, and brown adipose tissue development; ameliorate metabolic syndromes (including dyslipidemia, obesity, diabetes, and hypertension); and treat individuals with erectile dysfunction, sickle cell disease, muscular dystrophy, and pre-eclampsia.",

    "abstract": "In evolution, genes survived that could code for metabolic pathways, promoting long term survival during famines or fasting when suffering from trauma, disease or during physiological growth. This requires utilization of substrates, already present in some form in the body. Carbohydrate stores are limited and to survive long, their utilization is restricted to survival pathways, by inhibiting glucose oxidation and glycogen synthesis. This leads to insulin resistance and spares muscle protein, because being the main supplier of carbon for new glucose production. In these survival pathways, part of the glucose is degraded in glycolysis in peripheral (muscle) tissues to pyruvate and lactate (Warburg effect), which are partly reutilized for glucose formation in liver and kidney, completing the Cori-cycle. Another part of the glucose taken up by muscle contributes, together with muscle derived amino acids, to the production of substrates consisting of a complete amino acid mix but extra non-essential amino acids like glutamine, alanine, glycine and proline. These support cell proliferation, matrix deposition and redox regulation in tissues, specifically active in host response and during growth. In these tissues, also glucose is taken up delivering glycolytic intermediates, that branch off and act as building blocks and produce reducing equivalents. Lactate is also produced and released in the circulation, adding to the lactate released by muscle in the Cori-cycle and completing secondary glucose cycles. Increased fluxes through these cycles lead to modest hyperglycemia and hyperlactatemia in states of healthy growth and disease and are often misinterpreted as induced by hypoxia.",

For critically ill patients, ensuring optimum protein intake is important, potentially using a whey-containing source and supplemented with vitamin D and leucine. Agents like hydroxyl β-methylbutyrate and creatine can be used to promote muscle synthesis. Polyunsaturated fatty acids stimulate muscle production as well as have anti-inflammatory properties that may be useful in critical illness. Adjuncts like oxandralone promote anabolism. Resistance training has shown mixed results in the ICU setting but needs to be explored further with specific outcomes. Critically ill patients suffer from severe proteolysis during hospitalization as well as persistent inflammation, immunosuppression, and catabolism syndrome after discharge.

    "abstract": "Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF1) is an important regulator of collagen and extracellular matrix protein expression. We aimed to evaluate the effect of amino acids (AAs) on expression of IGF1 and IGF1-dependent genes in human myotubes and skeletal muscle and supposed that AAs administration increases IGF1 levels in blood and expression of IGF1 and IGF1-dependent genes in trained skeletal muscle, thereby reducing training-induced muscle damage. Human myotubes were incubated with Arg and Leu for 24 h. Then, the effects of long-term branched chain AAs administration (10 weeks, 0.1 g/kg body mass/day) to volunteers (six subjects per AAs and placebo groups) performing large training volumes regularly (cross country skiers, training twice a day) were examined. Incubating the myotubes with AAs increases expression of IGF1 mRNA isoforms and IGF1 secretion by 2-3 times. In athletes, long-term AAs administration increased basal blood levels of IGF1 (~50%) and expression of IGF1Ea mRNA slightly in skeletal muscle. There is no marked increase in expression of COL1A1, COL3A1, COL5A1, and LOX genes in skeletal muscle after AAs administration. However, expression of these genes in the combined group (placebo + AAs; n = 12) significantly correlated with the expression of IGF1Ea mRNA in muscle and did not correlate with IGF1 levels in the blood. AAs administration increases IGF1 expression in vitro and in vivo. To obtain more pronounced changes in expression of IGF1 and IGF1-dependent genes in skeletal muscle, it may be necessary to increase the dose and/or duration of AAs administration.",

    "title": "mTORC1 Mediates Lysine-Induced Satellite Cell Activation to Promote Skeletal Muscle Growth.",
    "abstract": "As the first limiting amino acid, lysine (Lys) has been thought to promote muscle fiber hypertrophy by increasing protein synthesis. However, the functions of Lys seem far more complex than that. Despite the fact that satellite cells (SCs) play an important role in skeletal muscle growth, the communication between Lys and SCs remains unclear. In this study, we investigated whether SCs participate directly in Lys-induced skeletal muscle growth and whether the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway was activated both in vivo and in vitro to mediate SC functions in response to Lys supplementation. Subsequently, the skeletal muscle growth of piglets was controlled by dietary Lys supplementation. Isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) analysis showed activated SCs were required for longissimus dorsi muscle growth, and this effect was accompanied by mTORC1 pathway upregulation. Furthermore, SC proliferation was governed by medium Lys concentrations, and the mTORC1 pathway was significantly enhanced in vitro. After verifying that rapamycin inhibits the mTORC1 pathway and suppresses SC proliferation, we conclude that Lys is not only a molecular building block for protein synthesis but also a signal that activates SCs to manipulate muscle growth via the mTORC1 pathway.",

    "abstract": "Diabetic vascular dysfunction is a major complication of diabetes. Methylglyoxal (MGO) is a dicarbonyl metabolite elevated in diabetic plasma that reacts with interstitial molecules to form advanced glycation end products (AGE). We investigated whether MGO affects the release of nitric oxide (NO) from rat aortic smooth muscle cells (ASMCs), and if L-arginine can prevent these effects of MGO. MGO was significantly elevated in serum from streptozotocin (STZ)-treated rats (121 ± 11.2 µM) compared with vehicle control rats (27.5 ± 9.2 µM). The pathological concentration of MGO (100 μM) was then applied to investigate its effect on inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression and NO release on interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) (100 IU/ml) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (100 µg/ml)-stimulated control ASMCs. MGO (100 µM) inhibited IFN-γ and LPS-stimulated iNOS expression through inhibiting Akt phosphorylation and inhibition of iNOS expression was prevented by L-arginine (100 µM) co-treatment. These findings show for the first time that MGO inhibits IFN-γ and LPS-stimulated iNOS expression in ASMCs, in addition to inhibiting IFN-γ and LPS-induced Akt phosphorylation. The actions of MGO might contribute to the vascular dysfunction induced by MGO in diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Amino acids are involved in many physiological processes in the body and serve as building blocks of proteins which are the main component of muscle mass. Often patients with cancer experience muscle wasting, which is associated with poor outcomes. The purpose of this paper is to discuss amino acid kinetics in cancer, review the evidence on the response to nutrition in patients with cancer, and to give recommendations on the appropriate level of amino acid or protein intake in cancer. Current evidence shows that amino acid kinetics in patients with cancer are disturbed, as reflected by increased and decreased levels of plasma amino acids, an increased whole body turnover of protein and muscle protein breakdown. A few studies show beneficial effects of acute and short-term supplementation of high protein meals or essential amino acid mixtures on muscle protein synthesis. Cancer is associated with disturbances in amino acid kinetics. A high protein intake or supplementation of amino acids may improve muscle protein synthesis. Future research needs to identify the optimal level and amino acid mixtures for patients with cancer, in particular for those who are malnourished.",

    "abstract": "The International Society of Sports Nutrition (ISSN) provides an objective and critical review related to the intake of protein for healthy, exercising individuals. Based on the current available literature, the position of the Society is as follows:An acute exercise stimulus, particularly resistance exercise, and protein ingestion both stimulate muscle protein synthesis (MPS) and are synergistic when protein consumption occurs before or after resistance exercise.For building muscle mass and for maintaining muscle mass through a positive muscle protein balance, an overall daily protein intake in the range of 1.4-2.0 g protein/kg body weight/day (g/kg/d) is sufficient for most exercising individuals, a value that falls in line within the Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range published by the Institute of Medicine for protein.Higher protein intakes (2.3-3.1 g/kg/d) may be needed to maximize the retention of lean body mass in resistance-trained subjects during hypocaloric periods.There is novel evidence that suggests higher protein intakes (>3.0 g/kg/d) may have positive effects on body composition in resistance-trained individuals (i.e., promote loss of fat mass).Recommendations regarding the optimal protein intake per serving for athletes to maximize MPS are mixed and are dependent upon age and recent resistance exercise stimuli. General recommendations are 0.25 g of a high-quality protein per kg of body weight, or an absolute dose of 20-40 g.Acute protein doses should strive to contain 700-3000 mg of leucine and/or a higher relative leucine content, in addition to a balanced array of the essential amino acids (EAAs).These protein doses should ideally be evenly distributed, every 3-4 h, across the day.The optimal time period during which to ingest protein is likely a matter of individual tolerance, since benefits are derived from pre- or post-workout ingestion; however, the anabolic effect of exercise is long-lasting (at least 24 h), but likely diminishes with increasing time post-exercise.While it is possible for physically active individuals to obtain their daily protein requirements through the consumption of whole foods, supplementation is a practical way of ensuring intake of adequate protein quality and quantity, while minimizing caloric intake, particularly for athletes who typically complete high volumes of training. Rapidly digested proteins that contain high proportions of essential amino acids (EAAs) and adequate leucine, are most effective in stimulating MPS. Different types and quality of protein can affect amino acid bioavailability following protein supplementation. Athletes should consider focusing on whole food sources of protein that contain all of the EAAs (i.e., it is the EAAs that are required to stimulate MPS). Endurance athletes should focus on achieving adequate carbohydrate intake to promote optimal performance; the addition of protein may help to offset muscle damage and promote recovery. Pre-sleep casein protein intake (30-40 g) provides increases in overnight MPS and metabolic rate without influencing lipolysis.",

    "abstract": "Poor utilization of amino acids contributes to losses of milk protein yield in dairy cows exposed to heat stress (HS). Our objective was to test the effect of essential amino acids on milk production in lactating dairy cows exposed to short-term HS conditions. To achieve this objective, 12 multiparous, lactating Holstein cows were assigned to two environments (thermoneutral (THN) or HS) from days 1 to 14 in a split-plot type cross-over design. All cows received 0 g/day of essential amino acids from days 1 to 7 (negative control (NC)) followed by an intravenous infusion of l-methionine (12 g/day), l-lysine (21 g/day), l-leucine (35 g/day), l-isoleucine (15 g/day) and l-valine (15 g/day, methionine, lysine and branched-chain amino acids (ML+BCAA)) from days 8 to 14. The basal diet was composed of ryegrass silage and hay, and a concentrate mix. This diet supplied 44 g of methionine, 125 g of lysine, 167 g of leucine, 98 g of isoleucine and 109 g of valine per day to the small intestine of THN cows. Temperature-humidity index was maintained below 66 for the THN environment, whereas the index was maintained above 68, peaking at 76, for 14 continuous h/day for the HS environment. Heat stress conditioning increased the udder temperature from 37.0°C to 39.6°C. Cows that received the ML+BCAA treatment had greater p.m. rectal and vaginal temperatures (0.50°C and 0.40°C, respectively), and respiration rate (8 breaths/min) compared with those on the NC treatment and exposed to a HS environment. However, neither NC nor ML+BCAA affected rectal or vaginal temperatures and respiration rates in the THN environment. Compared with THN, the HS environment reduced dry matter intake (1.48 kg/day), milk yield (2.82 kg/day) and milk protein yield (0.11 kg/day). However, compared with NC, the ML+BCAA treatment increased milk protein percent by 0.07 points. For the THN environment, the ML+BCAA treatment increased concentrations of milk urea nitrogen. For the HS environment, the ML+BCAA treatment decreased plasma concentrations of arginine, ornithine and citrulline; however, differences were not observed for the THN environment. In summary, HS elicited expected changes in production; however, infusions of ML+BCAA failed to increase milk protein yield. Lower dry matter intake and greater heat load in response to ML+BCAA contributed to the lack of response in milk production in HS cows. The ML+BCAA treatment may have reduced the breakdown of muscle protein in heat-stressed cows.",

    "abstract": "The maintenance of muscle mass and muscle strength is important for reducing the risk of chronic diseases. The age- related loss of muscle mass and strength is associated with adverse outcomes of physical disability, frailty and death. β-Hydroxy β-Methyl Butyrate (HMB), a metabolite of leucine, has beneficial effects on muscle mass and strength under various catabolic conditions. The objectives of the present study were to determine if age- related differences existed in endogenous plasma HMB levels, and to assess if HMB levels correlated to total appendicular lean mass and forearm grip strength. Anthropometry, dietary and physical activity assessment, and the estimation of fasting plasma HMB concentrations and handgrip strength were performed on the 305 subjects (children, young adults and older adults). Lean mass, which serves as a surrogate for muscle mass was measured using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Mean plasma HMB concentrations were significantly lower with increasing age groups, with children having highest mean HMB concentration (p<0.01) followed by young adults and older adults. Female subjects (across all ages) had significantly lower plasma HMB concentrations. A significant positive correlation between HMB concentrations and appendicular lean mass normalized for body weight (%), appendicular lean mass (r=0.37; p<0.001) was observed in the young adults and older adults group. Handgrip strength was positively associated with plasma HMB concentrations in young adults (r=0.58; p<0.01) and the older adults group (r=0.28; p<0.01). The findings of the present study suggest that there is an age- related decline in endogenous HMB concentrations in humans and the HMB concentrations were positively correlated with appendicular lean mass and hand grip strength in young adults and older adults group.",

    "abstract": "Age-related losses of muscle mass, strength, and function (sarcopenia) pose significant threats to physical performance, independence, and quality of life. Nutritional supplementation could positively influence aspects of sarcopenia and thereby prevent mobility disability. To test the hypothesis that a specific oral nutritional supplement can result in improvements in measures of sarcopenia. A multicenter, randomized, controlled, double-blind, 2 parallel-group trial among 380 sarcopenic primarily independent-living older adults with Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB; 0-12) scores between 4 and 9, and a low skeletal muscle mass index. The active group (n = 184) received a vitamin D and leucine-enriched whey protein nutritional supplement to consume twice daily for 13 weeks. The control group (n = 196) received an iso-caloric control product to consume twice daily for 13 weeks. Primary outcomes of handgrip strength and SPPB score, and secondary outcomes of chair-stand test, gait speed, balance score, and appendicular muscle mass (by DXA) were measured at baseline, week 7, and week 13 of the intervention. Handgrip strength and SPPB improved in both groups without significant between-group differences. The active group improved more in the chair-stand test compared with the control group, between-group effect (95% confidence interval): -1.01 seconds (-1.77 to -0.19), P = .018. The active group gained more appendicular muscle mass than the control group, between-group effect: 0.17 kg (0.004-0.338), P = .045. This 13-week intervention of a vitamin D and leucine-enriched whey protein oral nutritional supplement resulted in improvements in muscle mass and lower-extremity function among sarcopenic older adults. This study shows proof-of-principle that specific nutritional supplementation alone might benefit geriatric patients, especially relevant for those who are unable to exercise. These results warrant further investigations into the role of a specific nutritional supplement as part of a multimodal approach to prevent adverse outcomes among older adults at risk for disability.",

Film containing a combination of LAE with nisin Z reduced Staphylococcus aureus and Listeria monocytogenes Scott A inoculated onto ham surfaces by approximately 5.53 and 5.62 log10 CFU/cm(2), respectively during refrigerated storage. Escherichia coli O157:H7, O111, and O26 also were reduced by >4 log 10CFU/cm(2) on raw beef slices after treatment with the combination film and refrigerated storage.

    "abstract": "The metabolic roles for L-leucine, an essential branched-chain amino acid (BCAA), go far beyond serving exclusively as a building block for de novo protein synthesis. Growing evidence shows that leucine regulates protein and lipid metabolism in animals. Specifically, leucine activates the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway, including the 70 kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) and eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4E-binding protein 1 (4EBP1) to stimulate protein synthesis in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue and to promote mitochondrial biogenesis, resulting in enhanced cellular respiration and energy partitioning. Activation of cellular energy metabolism favors fatty acid oxidation to CO2 and water in adipocytes, lean tissue gain in young animals, and alleviation of muscle protein loss in aging adults, lactating mammals, and food-deprived subjects. As a functional amino acid, leucine holds great promise to enhance the growth, efficiency of food utilization, and health of animals and humans.",

    "abstract": "Given that the enhanced oxidative adaptations observed when training in carbohydrate (CHO)-restricted states is potentially regulated through free fatty acid (FFA)-mediated signalling and that leucine-rich protein elevates muscle protein synthesis, the present study aimed to test the hypothesis that leucine-enriched protein feeding enhances circulating leucine concentration but does not impair FFA availability or whole body lipid oxidation during exercise. Nine males cycled for 2 h at 70% VO2peak when fasted (PLACEBO) or having consumed a whey protein solution (WHEY) or a leucine-enriched whey protein gel (GEL), administered as 22 g 1 h pre-exercise, 11 g/h during and 22 g 30 min post-exercise. Total leucine administration was 14.4 g and 6.3 in GEL and WHEY, respectively. Mean plasma leucine concentrations were elevated in GEL (P = 0.001) compared with WHEY and PLACEBO (375 ± 100, 272 ± 51, 146 ± 14 µmol L(-1), respectively). No differences (P = 0.153) in plasma FFA (WHEY 0.53 ± 0.30, GEL 0.45 ± 0.25, PLACEBO 0.65 ± 0.30, mmol L(-1)) or whole body lipid oxidation during exercise (WHEY 0.37 ± 0.26, GEL 0.36 ± 0.24, PLACEBO 0.34 ± 0.24 g/min) were apparent between trials, despite elevated (P = 0.001) insulin in WHEY and GEL compared with PLACEBO (38 ± 16, 35 ± 16, 22 ± 11 pmol L(-1), respectively). We conclude that leucine-enriched protein feeding does not impair FFA availability or whole body lipid oxidation during exercise, thus having practical applications for athletes who deliberately train in CHO-restricted states to promote skeletal muscle adaptations.",

    "abstract": "The characteristics of endothelium-dependent relaxations in response to insulin and acetylcholine (ACh) in the mouse posterior tibial artery (PTA) were studied on wire myograph, and compared to those in the mouse main mesenteric artery (MMA). Insulin-induced relaxation in PTA was reversed by PI3K and Akt inhibitors, LY294002 and triciribine, but not by nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) or guanylate cyclase inhibitor, ODQ. The relaxation in PTA was also inhibited by apamin (small-conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channel blocker) plus charybdotoxin (intermediate-conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channel blocker), elevated KCl or ouabain (Na(+)-K(+) ATPase inhibitor) plus BaCl(2) [inwardly rectifying K(+) (K(IR)) channel inhibitor]; whereas L-NAME but not triciribine inhibited ACh-induced relaxation in PTA. On the other hand, nitric oxide and endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor albeit to a less extent mediated both insulin- and ACh-induced relaxations in MMA. The present study is for the first time dissecting out the components of endothelium-dependent relaxation in mouse PTA and suggesting differential responses to different agonists in distinctive blood vessels.",

    "title": "Identification of key binding site residues of MCT1 for AR-C155858 reveals the molecular basis of its isoform selectivity.",
    "abstract": "The proton-linked monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) are required for lactic acid transport into and out of all mammalian cells. Thus, they play an essential role in tumour cells that are usually highly glycolytic and are promising targets for anti-cancer drugs. AR-C155858 is a potent MCT1 inhibitor (Ki ~2 nM) that also inhibits MCT2 when associated with basigin but not MCT4. Previous work [Ovens, M.J. et al. (2010) Biochem. J. 425, 523-530] revealed that AR-C155858 binding to MCT1 occurs from the intracellular side and involves transmembrane helices (TMs) 7-10. In the present paper, we generate a molecular model of MCT4 based on our previous models of MCT1 and identify residues in the intracellular substrate-binding cavity that differ significantly between MCT4 and MCT1/MCT2 and so might account for differences in inhibitor binding. We tested their involvement using site-directed mutagenesis (SDM) of MCT1 to change residues individually or in combination with their MCT4 equivalent and determined inhibitor sensitivity following expression in Xenopus oocytes. Phe360 and Ser364 were identified as important for AR-C155858 binding with the F360Y/S364G mutant exhibiting >100-fold reduction in inhibitor sensitivity. To refine the binding site further, we used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and additional SDM. This approach implicated six more residues whose involvement was confirmed by both transport studies and [3H]-AR-C155858 binding to oocyte membranes. Taken together, our data imply that Asn147, Arg306 and Ser364 are important for directing AR-C155858 to its final binding site which involves interaction of the inhibitor with Lys38, Asp302 and Phe360 (residues that also play key roles in the translocation cycle) and also Leu274 and Ser278.",

    "title": "Amino acid δ13C analysis shows flexibility in the routing of dietary protein and lipids to the tissue of an omnivore.",
    "abstract": "Stable-isotope analysis (SIA) has revolutionized animal ecology by providing time-integrated estimates of the use of resources and/or habitats. SIA is based on the premise that the isotopic composition of a consumer's tissues originates from its food, but is offset by trophic-discrimination (enrichment) factors controlled by metabolic processes associated with the assimilation of nutrients and the biosynthesis of tissues. Laboratory preparation protocols dictate that tissues both of consumers and of their potential prey be lipid-extracted prior to analysis, because (1) lipids have carbon isotope (δ(13)C) values that are lower by approximately 3-8‰ than associated proteins and (2) amino acids in consumers' proteinaceous tissues are assumed to be completely routed from dietary protein. In contrast, models of stable-isotope mixing assume that dietary macromolecules are broken into their elemental constituents from which non-essential amino acids are resynthesized to build tissues. Here, we show that carbon from non-protein dietary macromolecules, namely lipids, was used to synthesize muscle tissue in an omnivorous rodent (Mus musculus). We traced the influence of dietary lipids on the synthesis of consumers' tissues by inversely varying the dietary proportion of C4-based lipids and C3-based protein while keeping carbohydrate content constant in four dietary treatments, and analyzing the δ(13)C values of amino acids in mouse muscle after 4 months of feeding. The influence of dietary lipids on non-essential amino acids varied as function of biosynthetic pathway. The source of carbon in ketogenic amino acids synthesized through the Krebs cycle was highly sensitive to dietary lipid content, with significant increases of approximately 2-4‰ in Glutamate and Aspartate δ(13)C values from the 5% to 15% dietary lipid treatment. Glucogenic amino acids (Glycine and Serine) were less sensitive to dietary lipid, but increased by approximately 3-4‰ from the 25% to 40% lipid diet. As expected, the δ(13)C values of essential amino acids did not vary significantly among diets. Although lipids provide a calorie-rich resource that fuels energy requirements, our results show that they also can be an important elemental source of carbon that contributes to the non-essential amino acids used to build structural tissue like muscle. As such, the calculation of trophic-discrimination factors for animals that consume a lipid-rich diet should consider lipid carbon as a building block for proteinaceous tissues. Careful consideration of the macromolecular composition in the diet of the consumer of interest will help to further refine the use of SIA to study animal ecology and physiology.",

    "title": "Obesity-induced lysine acetylation increases cardiac fatty acid oxidation and impairs insulin signalling.",
    "abstract": "Lysine acetylation is a novel post-translational pathway that regulates the activities of enzymes involved in both fatty acid and glucose metabolism. We examined whether lysine acetylation controls heart glucose and fatty acid oxidation in high-fat diet (HFD) obese and SIRT3 knockout (KO) mice. C57BL/6 mice were placed on either a HFD (60% fat) or a low-fat diet (LFD; 4% fat) for 16 or 18 weeks. Cardiac fatty acid oxidation rates were significantly increased in HFD vs. LFD mice (845 ± 76 vs. 551 ± 87 nmol/g dry wt min, P < 0.05). Activities of the fatty acid oxidation enzymes, long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCAD), and β-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (β-HAD) were increased in hearts from HFD vs. LFD mice, and were associated with LCAD and β-HAD hyperacetylation. Cardiac protein hyperacetylation in HFD-fed mice was associated with a decrease in SIRT3 expression, while expression of the mitochondrial acetylase, general control of amino acid synthesis 5 (GCN5)-like 1 (GCN5L1), did not change. Interestingly, SIRT3 deletion in mice also led to an increase in cardiac fatty acid oxidation compared with wild-type (WT) mice (422 ± 29 vs. 291 ± 17 nmol/g dry wt min, P < 0.05). Cardiac lysine acetylation was increased in SIRT3 KO mice compared with WT mice, including increased acetylation and activity of LCAD and β-HAD. Although the HFD and SIRT3 deletion decreased glucose oxidation, pyruvate dehydrogenase acetylation was unaltered. However, the HFD did increase Akt acetylation, while decreasing its phosphorylation and activity. We conclude that increased cardiac fatty acid oxidation in response to high-fat feeding is controlled, in part, via the down-regulation of SIRT3 and concomitant increased acetylation of mitochondrial β-oxidation enzymes.",

    "abstract": "The calcium sensitivity of cardiac and skeletal muscle is reduced during cytosolic acidosis, and this inhibition is more pronounced in cardiac muscle. Replacing cardiac troponin I with skeletal troponin I reduces the pH sensitivity of cardiac muscle. This diminished pH sensitivity depends on a single amino acid difference in troponin I: an alanine in cardiac and a histidine in skeletal. Studies suggested that when this histidine is protonated, it forms an electrostatic interaction with glutamate 19 on the surface of cardiac troponin C. Structures of the skeletal and cardiac troponin complexes show very different conformations for the region of troponin I surrounding this residue. In this study, we determined the structure of skeletal troponin I bound to cardiac troponin C. Skeletal troponin I is found to bind to cardiac troponin C with histidine 130 in close proximity to glutamate 19. This conformation is homologous to the crystal structure of the skeletal troponin complex; but different than in the cardiac complex. We show that an A162H variant of cardiac troponin I adopts a conformation similar to the skeletal structure. The implications of these structural differences in the context of cardiac muscle regulation are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Leucine plays an important role in protein synthesis, brain functions, building muscle mass, and helping the body when it undergoes stress. Here, we report a new amperometric bienzyme screen-printed biosensor for the determination of leucine, by coimmobilizing p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase (HBH) and leucine dehydrogenase (LDH) on a screen-printed electrode with NADP(+) and p-hydroxybenzoate as the cofactors. The detection principle of the sensor is that LDH catalyzes the specific dehydrogenation of leucine by using NADP(+) as a cofactor. The product, NADPH, triggers the hydroxylation of p-hydroxybenzoate by HBH in the presence of oxygen to produce 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate, which results in a change in electron concentration at the working carbon electrode, which is detected by the potentiostat. The sensor shows a linear detection range between 10 and 600 μM with a detection limit of 2 μM. The response is reproducible and has a fast measuring time of 5-10 s after the addition of a given concentration of leucine.",

    "abstract": "Diabetes-induced organ damage is significantly associated with the activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Recently, several studies have demonstrated a change in the RAS from an extracellular to an intracellular system, in several cell types, in response to high ambient glucose levels. In cardiac myocytes, intracellular angiotensin (ANG) II synthesis and actions are ACE and AT1 independent, respectively. However, a role of this system in diabetes-induced organ damage is not clear. To determine a role of the intracellular ANG II in diabetic cardiomyopathy, we induced diabetes using streptozotocin in AT1a receptor deficient (AT1a-KO) mice to exclude any effects of extracellular ANG II. Further, diabetic animals were treated with a renin inhibitor aliskiren, an ACE inhibitor benazeprilat, and an AT1 receptor blocker valsartan. AT1a-KO mice developed significant diastolic and systolic dysfunction following 10 wks of diabetes, as determined by echocardiography. All three drugs prevented the development of cardiac dysfunction in these animals, without affecting blood pressure or glucose levels. A significant down regulation of components of the kallikrein-kinin system (KKS) was observed in diabetic animals, which was largely prevented by benazeprilat and valsartan, while aliskiren normalized kininogen expression. These data indicated that the AT1a receptor, thus extracellular ANG II, are not required for the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy. The KKS might contribute to the beneficial effects of benazeprilat and valsartan in diabetic cardiomyopathy. A role of intracellular ANG II is suggested by the inhibitory effects of aliskiren, which needs confirmation in future studies.",

    "title": "Oral branched-chain amino acid supplements that reduce brain serotonin during exercise in rats also lower brain catecholamines.",
    "abstract": "Exercise raises brain serotonin release and is postulated to cause fatigue in athletes; ingestion of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA), by competitively inhibiting tryptophan transport into brain, lowers brain tryptophan uptake and serotonin synthesis and release in rats, and reputedly in humans prevents exercise-induced increases in serotonin and fatigue. This latter effect in humans is disputed. But BCAA also competitively inhibit tyrosine uptake into brain, and thus catecholamine synthesis and release. Since increasing brain catecholamines enhances physical performance, BCAA ingestion could lower catecholamines, reduce performance and thus negate any serotonin-linked benefit. We therefore examined in rats whether BCAA would reduce both brain tryptophan and tyrosine concentrations and serotonin and catecholamine synthesis. Sedentary and exercising rats received BCAA or vehicle orally; tryptophan and tyrosine concentrations and serotonin and catecholamine synthesis rates were measured 1 h later in brain. BCAA reduced brain tryptophan and tyrosine concentrations, and serotonin and catecholamine synthesis. These reductions in tyrosine concentrations and catecholamine synthesis, but not tryptophan or serotonin synthesis, could be prevented by co-administering tyrosine with BCAA. Complete essential amino acid mixtures, used to maintain or build muscle mass, were also studied, and produced different effects on brain tryptophan and tyrosine concentrations and serotonin and catecholamine synthesis. Since pharmacologically increasing brain catecholamine function improves physical performance, the finding that BCAA reduce catecholamine synthesis may explain why this treatment does not enhance physical performance in humans, despite reducing serotonin synthesis. If so, adding tyrosine to BCAA supplements might allow a positive action on performance to emerge.",

    "abstract": "Resistance exercise and amino acid availability are positive regulators of muscle protein net balance (NB). However, anabolic responses to resistance exercise and protein supplementation deserve further elucidation. The purpose was to compare intakes of whey, caseinate (both: 0.30 g/kg lean body mass), or a non-caloric control after heavy resistance exercise on protein turnover and mRNA expressions of forkhead homeobox type O (FOXO) isoforms, muscle RING finger 1 (MuRF1), and Atrogin1 in young healthy males. Protein turnover was determined by stable isotope-labeled leucine and femoral arteriovenous blood samples at rest and during 6-h recovery. Muscle biopsies were collected at -60 min (rest) and at 60, 210, and 360 min in the recovery period. During recovery, leucine NB was significantly higher in the protein groups compared to control (P < 0.001). Differences in leucine NB, rate of disappearance, and oxidation were observed in the early recovery period between whey and caseinate. FOXO1A and MuRF1 were upregulated at 60 and 210 min, and, in contrast, FOXO3 and Atrogin1 were downregulated at 210 and 360 min. For leucine rate of appearance and all FOXO and atrogene mRNA expressions, no differences were observed between groups. Whey and caseinate were equally superior to control in the 6-h recovery period and displayed temporal differences with whey having a fast and superior effect in the early part of the recovery period. Effects on mRNA expressions indicate different regulatory mechanisms on the ubiquitin ligases MuRF1 and Atrogin1 in recovery from heavy resistance exercise.",

    "title": "O-GlcNAcylation of αB-crystallin regulates its stress-induced translocation and cytoprotection.",
    "abstract": "Under normal conditions, the ubiquitously expressed αB-crystallin functions as a chaperone. αB-crystallin has been implicated in a variety of pathologies, consistent with a build-up of protein aggregates, such as neuromuscular disorders, myofibrillar myopathies, and cardiomyopathies. αB-crystallins' cardioprotection is partially attributed to its translocation and binding to cytoskeletal elements in response to stress. The triggers for this translocation are not clearly understood. In the heart, αB-crystallin undergoes at least three significant post-translational modifications: phosphorylation at ser-45 and 59 and O-GlcNAcylation (O-linked attachment of the monosaccharide β-N-acetyl-glucosamine) at thr-170. Whether phosphorylation status drives translocation remains controversial. Therefore, we evaluated the role of αB-crystallins' O-GlcNAcylation in its stress-induced translocation and cytoprotection in cardiomyocytes under stress. Immunoblotting and precipitation experiments with anti-O-GlcNAc antibody (CTD110.6) and glycoprotein staining (Pro-Q Emerald) both demonstrate robust stress-induced O-GlcNAcylation of αB-crystallin. A non-O-GlcNAcylatable αB-crystallin mutant (αB-T170A) showed diminished translocation in response to heat shock and robust phosphorylation at both ser-45 and ser-59. Cell survival assays show a loss of overexpression-associated cytoprotection with the non-glycosylatable mutant to multiple stresses. While ectopic expression of wild-type αB-crystallin strongly stabilized ZsProSensor, a fusion protein rapidly degraded by the proteasome, the non-O-GlcNAcylatable version did not. Therefore, we believe the O-GlcNAcylation of αB-crystallin is a dynamic and important regulator of both its localization and function.",

    "title": "Review of clinical trials for mitochondrial disorders: 1997-2012.",
    "abstract": "Over the last 15 years, some 16 open and controlled clinical trials for potential treatments of mitochondrial diseases have been reported or are in progress, and are summarized and reviewed herein. These include trials of administering dichloroacetate (an activator of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex), arginine or citrulline (precursors of nitric oxide), coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10; part of the electron transport chain and an antioxidant), idebenone (a synthetic analogue of CoQ10), EPI-743 (a novel oral potent 2-electron redox cycling agent), creatine (a precursor of phosphocreatine), combined administration (of creatine, α-lipoate, and CoQ10), and exercise training (to increase muscle mitochondria). These trials have included patients with various mitochondrial disorders, a selected subcategory of mitochondrial disorders, or specific mitochondrial disorders (Leber hereditary optic neuropathy or mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes). The trial designs have varied from open-label/uncontrolled, open-label/controlled, or double-blind/placebo-controlled/crossover. Primary outcomes have ranged from single, clinically-relevant scores to multiple measures. Eight of these trials have been well-controlled, completed trials. Of these only 1 (treatment with creatine) showed a significant change in primary outcomes, but this was not reproduced in 2 subsequent trials with creatine with different patients. One trial (idebenone treatment of Leber hereditary optic neuropathy) did not show significant improvement in the primary outcome, but there was significant improvement in a subgroup of patients. Despite the paucity of benefits found so far, well-controlled clinical trials are essential building blocks in the continuing search for more effective treatment of mitochondrial disease, and current trials based on information gained from these prior experiences are in progress. Because of difficulties in recruiting sufficient mitochondrial disease patients and the relatively large expense of conducting such trials, advantageous strategies include crossover designs (where possible), multicenter collaboration, and the selection of very few, clinically relevant, primary outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Chromium is extensively used in leather, chrome plating and refining industries. On one hand the occupational exposure to chromium leads to cancer, whereas on the contrary certain Cr(III) compounds have been proposed as nutritional supplements for Type II diabetes and as muscle building agents. Despite the positive outlook of chromium as a bio-essential element, there is increasing concern over the therapeutic application of Cr(III) based supplements, its bioavailability and toxicity profile. In this perspective, we discuss the role of ligand structure in mediating the interaction of chromium(III) complexes with DNA/protein, their mutagenic outcomes, adduct reparability and as nutritional supplements.",

    "abstract": "Plasma levels of asymmetric dimethylarginine or markers of reactive oxygen species are increased in subjects with risk factors for cardiovascular disease or chronic kidney disease. We tested the hypothesis that reactive oxygen species generate cellular asymmetric dimethylarginine that together cause endothelial dysfunction that underlies the risk of subsequent disease. Rat preglomerular vascular smooth muscle cells transfected with p22(phox) had increased NADPH oxidase activity, enhanced activity and expression of protein arginine methyltransferase, and reduced activity and protein expression of dimethylarginine dimethylaminotransferase and of cationic amino acid transferase 1 resulting in increased cellular levels of asymmetric dimethylarginine. Rats infused with angiotensin II had oxidative stress. The endothelial function of their mesenteric arterioles was changed from vasodilatation to vasoconstriction, accompanied by increased vascular asymmetric dimethylarginine. All of these changes were prevented by Tempol. In vivo silencing of dimethylarginine dimethylaminotransferase 1 increased plasma levels of asymmetric dimethylarginine, whereas silencing of dimethylarginine dimethylaminotransferase 2 impaired endothelial function. We suggest that initiation factors, such as angiotensin II, expressed in blood vessels or tissues of subjects with cardiovascular and kidney disease risk factors generate reactive oxygen species from NADPH oxidase that enhances cellular asymmetric dimethylarginine in an amplification loop. This leads to adverse changes in vascular and organ functions, as a consequence of reduced tissue levels of NO and increased reactive oxygen species. Thus, we conclude that reactive oxygen species and asymmetric dimethylarginine form a tightly coupled amplification system that translates cardiovascular/kidney risk into overt disease.",

    "abstract": "Monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) isoforms 1-4 catalyze the proton-linked transport of monocarboxylates such as L-lactate across the plasma membrane, whereas MCT8 and MCT10 are thyroid hormone and aromatic amino acid transporters, respectively. The importance of MCTs is becoming increasingly evident as their extensive physiological and pathological roles are revealed. MCTs 1-4 play essential metabolic roles in most tissues with their distinct properties, expression profile, and subcellular localization matching the particular metabolic needs of a tissue. Important metabolic roles include energy metabolism in the brain, skeletal muscle, heart, tumor cells, and T-lymphocyte activation, gluconeogenesis in the liver and kidney, spermatogenesis, bowel metabolism of short-chain fatty acids, and drug transport. MCT8 is essential for thyroid hormone transport across the blood-brain barrier. Genetic perturbation of MCT function may be involved in disease states such as pancreatic β-cell malfunction (inappropriate MCT1 expression), chronic fatigue syndromes (impairment of muscle MCT function), and psychomotor retardation (MCT8 mutation). MCT expression can be regulated at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. Of particular importance is the upregulation of muscle MCT1 expression in response to training and MCT4 expression in response to hypoxia. The latter is mediated by hypoxia inducible factor 1α and often observed in tumor cells that rely almost entirely on glycolysis for their energy provision. The recent discovery of potent and specific MCT1 inhibitors that prevent proliferation of T-lymphocytes confirms that MCTs may be promising pharmacological targets including for cancer chemotherapy.",

    "abstract": "We have examined changes in the chromatin landscape during muscle differentiation by mapping the genome-wide location of ten key histone marks and transcription factors in mouse myoblasts and terminally differentiated myotubes, providing an exceptionally rich dataset that has enabled discovery of key epigenetic changes underlying myogenesis. Using this compendium, we focused on a well-known repressive mark, histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation, and identified novel regulatory elements flanking the myogenin gene that function as a key differentiation-dependent switch during myogenesis. Next, we examined the role of Polycomb-mediated H3K27 methylation in gene repression by systematically ablating components of both PRC1 and PRC2 complexes. Surprisingly, we found mechanistic differences between transient and permanent repression of muscle differentiation and lineage commitment genes and observed that the loss of PRC1 and PRC2 components produced opposing differentiation defects. These phenotypes illustrate striking differences as compared to embryonic stem cell differentiation and suggest that PRC1 and PRC2 do not operate sequentially in muscle cells. Our studies of PRC1 occupancy also suggested a \"fail-safe\" mechanism, whereby PRC1/Bmi1 concentrates at genes specifying nonmuscle lineages, helping to retain H3K27me3 in the face of declining Ezh2-mediated methyltransferase activity in differentiated cells.",

    "title": "Redox regulation of the mitochondrial K(ATP) channel in cardioprotection.",
    "abstract": "The mitochondrial ATP-sensitive potassium channel (mK(ATP)) is important in the protective mechanism of ischemic preconditioning (IPC). The channel is reportedly sensitive to reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, and the aim of this study was to compare such species in parallel, to build a more comprehensive picture of mK(ATP) regulation. mK(ATP) activity was measured by both osmotic swelling and Tl(+) flux assays, in isolated rat heart mitochondria. An isolated adult rat cardiomyocyte model of ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury was also used to determine the role of mK(ATP) in cardioprotection by nitroxyl. Key findings were as follows: (i) mK(ATP) was activated by O(2)(-) and H(2)O(2) but not other peroxides. (ii) mK(ATP) was inhibited by NADPH. (iii) mK(ATP) was activated by S-nitrosothiols, nitroxyl, and nitrolinoleate. The latter two species also inhibited mitochondrial complex II. (iv) Nitroxyl protected cardiomyocytes against IR injury in an mK(ATP)-dependent manner. Overall, these results suggest that the mK(ATP) channel is activated by specific reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, and inhibited by NADPH. The redox modulation of mK(ATP) may be an underlying mechanism for its regulation in the context of IPC. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Mitochondria and Cardioprotection.",

    "abstract": "Excessive activation of calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII) causes arrhythmias and heart failure, but the cellular mechanisms for CaMKII-targeted proteins causing disordered cell membrane excitability and myocardial dysfunction remain uncertain. Failing human cardiomyocytes exhibit increased CaMKII and voltage-gated Ca(2+) channel (Ca(V)1.2) activity, and enhanced expression of a specific Ca(V)1.2 beta-subunit protein isoform (beta(2a)). We recently identified Ca(V)1.2 beta(2a) residues critical for CaMKII phosphorylation (Thr 498) and binding (Leu 493), suggesting the hypothesis that these amino acids are crucial for cardiomyopathic consequences of CaMKII signaling. Here we show WT beta(2a) expression causes cellular Ca(2+) overload, arrhythmia-triggering cell membrane potential oscillations called early afterdepolarizations (EADs), and premature death in paced adult rabbit ventricular myocytes. Prevention of intracellular Ca(2+) release by ryanodine or global cellular CaMKII inhibition reduced EADs and improved cell survival to control levels in WT beta(2a)-expressing ventricular myocytes. In contrast, expression of beta(2a) T498A or L493A mutants mimicked the protective effects of ryanodine or global cellular CaMKII inhibition by reducing Ca(2+) entry through Ca(V)1.2 and inhibiting EADs. Furthermore, Ca(V)1.2 currents recorded from cells overexpressing CaMKII phosphorylation- or binding-incompetent beta(2a) subunits were incapable of entering a CaMKII-dependent high-activity gating mode (mode 2), indicating that beta(2a) Thr 498 and Leu 493 are required for Ca(V)1.2 activation by CaMKII in native cells. These data show that CaMKII binding and phosphorylation sites on beta(2a) are concise but pivotal components of a molecular and biophysical and mechanism for EADs and impaired survival in adult cardiomyocytes.",

    "title": "Mdm2 directs the ubiquitination of beta-arrestin-sequestered cAMP phosphodiesterase-4D5.",
    "abstract": "Beta-arrestin plays a key role in regulating beta2-adrenoreceptor signaling by interdicting activation of adenylyl cyclase and selectively sequestering cAMP phosphodiesterase-4D5 (PDE4D5) for delivery of an active cAMP degrading system to the site of cAMP synthesis. Here we show that the beta-agonist, isoprenaline, triggers the rapid and transient ubiquitination of PDE4D5 in primary cardiomyocytes, mouse embryo fibroblasts, and HEK293B2 cells constitutively expressing beta2-adrenoceptors. Reconstitution analyses in beta-arrestin1/2 double knockout cells plus small interference RNA knockdown studies indicate that a beta-arrestin-scaffolded pool of the E3-ubiquitin ligase, Mdm2, mediates PDE4D5 ubiquitination. Critical for this is the ubiquitin-interacting motif located in the extreme C terminus of PDE4D5, which is specific to the PDE4D sub-family. In vitro ubiquitination [corrected] of a PDE4D5 spot-immobilized peptide array, followed by a mutagenesis strategy, showed that PDE4D5 ubiquitination occurs at Lys-48, Lys-53, and Lys-78, which are located within its isoform-specific N-terminal region, as well as at Lys-140 located within its regulatory UCR1 module. We suggest that mono-ubiquitination at Lys-140 primes PDE4D5 for a subsequent cascade of polyubiquitination occurring within its isoform-specific N-terminal region at Lys-48, Lys-53, and Lys-78. PDE4D5 interacts with a non-ubiquitinated beta-arrestin sub-population that is likely to be protected from Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination due to steric hindrance caused by sequestered PDE4D5. Ubiquitination of PDE4D5 elicits an increase in the fraction of PDE4D5 sequestered by beta-arrestin in cells, thereby contributing to the fidelity of PDE4D5-beta-arrestin interaction, as well as decreasing the fraction of PDE4D5 sequestered by the scaffolding protein, RACK1.",

    "abstract": "It is the position of the American Dietetic Association, Dietitians of Canada, and the American College of Sports Medicine that physical activity, athletic performance, and recovery from exercise are enhanced by optimal nutrition. These organizations recommend appropriate selection of foods and fluids, timing of intake, and supplement choices for optimal health and exercise performance. This updated position paper couples a rigorous, systematic, evidence-based analysis of nutrition and performance-specific literature with current scientific data related to energy needs, assessment of body composition, strategies for weight change, nutrient and fluid needs, special nutrient needs during training and competition, the use of supplements and ergogenic aids, nutrition recommendations for vegetarian athletes, and the roles and responsibilities of the sports dietitian. Energy and macronutrient needs, especially carbohydrate and protein, must be met during times of high physical activity to maintain body weight, replenish glycogen stores, and provide adequate protein to build and repair tissue. Fat intake should be sufficient to provide the essential fatty acids and fat-soluble vitamins and to contribute energy for weight maintenance. Although exercise performance can be affected by body weight and composition, these physical measures should not be a criterion for sports performance and daily weigh-ins are discouraged. Adequate food and fluid should be consumed before, during, and after exercise to help maintain blood glucose concentration during exercise, maximize exercise performance, and improve recovery time. Athletes should be well hydrated before exercise and drink enough fluid during and after exercise to balance fluid losses. Sports beverages containing carbohydrates and electrolytes may be consumed before, during, and after exercise to help maintain blood glucose concentration, provide fuel for muscles, and decrease risk of dehydration and hyponatremia. Vitamin and mineral supplements are not needed if adequate energy to maintain body weight is consumed from a variety of foods. However, athletes who restrict energy intake, use severe weight-loss practices, eliminate one or more food groups from their diet, or consume unbalanced diets with low micronutrient density may require supplements. Because regulations specific to nutritional ergogenic aids are poorly enforced, they should be used with caution and only after careful product evaluation for safety, efficacy, potency, and legality. A qualified sports dietitian and, in particular, the Board Certified Specialist in Sports Dietetics in the United States, should provide individualized nutrition direction and advice after a comprehensive nutrition assessment.",

    "abstract": "The creatine/creatine kinase system decreases drastically in sarcoma. In the present study, an investigation of catalytic activities, western blot and mRNA expression unambiguously demonstrates the prominent expression of the creatine-synthesizing enzymes l-arginine:glycine amidinotransferase and N-guanidinoacetate methyltransferase in sarcoma, Ehrlich ascites carcinoma and Sarcoma 180 cells, whereas both enzymes were virtually undetectable in normal muscle. Compared to that of normal animals, these enzymes remained unaffected in the kidney or liver of sarcoma-bearing mice. High activity and expression of mitochondrial arginase II in sarcoma indicated increased ornithine formation. Slightly or moderately higher levels of ornithine, guanidinoacetate and creatinine were observed in sarcoma compared to muscle. Despite the intrinsically low level of creatine in Ehrlich ascites carcinoma and Sarcoma 180 cells, these cells could significantly take up and release creatine, suggesting a functional creatine transport, as verified by measuring mRNA levels of creatine transporter. Transcript levels of arginase II, ornithine-decarboxylase, S-adenosyl-homocysteine hydrolase and methionine-synthase were significantly upregulated in sarcoma and in Ehrlich ascites carcinoma and Sarcoma 180 cells. Overall, the enzymes related to creatine and arginine/methionine metabolism were found to be significantly upregulated in malignant cells. However, the low levels of creatine kinase in the same malignant cells do not appear to be sufficient for the building up of an effective creatine/phosphocreatine pool. Instead of supporting creatine biosynthesis, l-arginine:glycine amidinotransferase and N-guanidinoacetate methyltransferase appear to be geared to support cancer cell metabolism in the direction of polyamine and methionine synthesis because both these compounds are in high demand in proliferating cancer cells.",

Using a series of nested deletion mutants, it is now shown that the two C-terminal lysine residues are required for the enhanced metastasis, invasion and migration abilities that S100A4 confers on cells in a model system of metastasis. Basic C-terminal residues enhance the affinity between S100A4 and its best characterized target, a recombinant C-terminal fragment of non-muscle myosin II heavy chain isoform A (NMMHC-IIA). In wild-type S100A4 protein, the presence of the C-terminal lysine, residue 101, enhances the rate of association between S100A4 and NMMHC-IIA. These results identify the amino acids of S100A4 that are involved in metastasis induction and show that the C-terminal region of S100A4 is a possible target for inhibitors of its metastatic action.",

    "abstract": "P2X(1) receptors belong to a family of cation channels gated by extracellular ATP; they are found inter alia in smooth muscle, platelets, and immune cells. Suramin has been widely used as an antagonist at P2X receptors, and its analog 4,4',4'',4'''-[carbonylbis(imino-5,1,3-benzenetriylbis(carbonylimino))] tetrakis-benzene-1,3-disulfonic acid (NF449) is selective for the P2X(1) subtype. Human and mouse P2X(1) receptors were expressed in human embryonic kidney cells, and membrane currents evoked by ATP were recorded. ATP (10 nm to 100 microm) was applied only once to each cell, to avoid the profound desensitization exhibited by P2X(1) receptors. Suramin (10 microm) and NF449 (3-300 nM) effectively blocked the human receptor. Suramin had little effect on the mouse receptor. Suramin and NF449 are polysulfonates, with six and eight negative charges, respectively. We hypothesized that species differences might result from differences in positive residues presented by the large receptor ectodomain. Four lysines in the human sequence (Lys(111), Lys(127), Lys(138), and Lys(148)) were changed individually and together to their counterparts in the mouse sequence. The substitution K138E, either alone or together with K111Q, K127Q, and K148N, reduced the sensitivity to block by both suramin and NF449. Conversely, when lysine was introduced into the mouse receptor, the sensitivity to block by suramin and NF449 was much increased for E138K, but not for Q111K, Q127K, or N148K. The results explain the marked species difference in antagonist sensitivity and identify an ectodomain lysine residue that plays a key role in the binding of both suramin and NF449 to P2X(1) receptors.",

    "title": "Nuclear Dbf2-related protein kinases (NDRs) in isolated cardiac myocytes and the myocardium: activation by cellular stresses and by phosphoprotein serine-/threonine-phosphatase inhibitors.",
    "abstract": "The nuclear Dbf2-related protein kinases 1 and 2 (NDR1/2) are closely-related AGC family kinases that are strongly conserved through evolution. In mammals, they are activated inter alia by phosphorylation of an hydrophobic domain threonine-residue [NDR1(Thr-444)/NDR2(Thr-442)] by an extrinsic protein kinase followed by autophosphorylation of a catalytic domain serine-residue [NDR1(Ser-281)/NDR2(Ser-282)]. We examined NDR1/2 expression and regulation in primary cultures of neonatal rat cardiac myocytes and in perfused adult rat hearts. In myocytes, transcripts for NDR2, but not NDR1, were induced by the hypertrophic agonist, endothelin-1. NDR1(Thr-444) and NDR2(Thr-442) were rapidly phosphorylated (maximal in 15-30 min) in myocytes exposed to some phosphoprotein Ser-/Thr-phosphatase 1/2 inhibitors (calyculin A, okadaic acid) and, to a lesser extent, by hyperosmotic shock, low concentrations of H(2)O(2), or chelerythrine. In myocytes adenovirally-transduced to express FLAG-NDR2 (which exhibited a mainly-cytoplasmic localisation), the same agents increased FLAG-NDR2 activity as assessed by in vitro protein kinase assays, indicative of FLAG-NDR2(Ser-282/Thr-442) phosphorylation. Calyculin A-induced phosphorylation of NDR1(Thr-444)/NDR2(Thr-442) and activation of FLAG-NDR2 were inhibited by staurosporine, but not by other protein kinase inhibitors tested. In ex vivo rat hearts, NDR1(Thr-444)/NDR2(Thr-442) were phosphorylated in response to ischaemia-reperfusion or calyculin A. From a pathological viewpoint, we conclude that activities of NDR1 and NDR2 are responsive to cytotoxic stresses in heart preparations and this may represent a previously-unidentified response to myocardial ischaemia in vivo.",

    "title": "Alternative splicing of Nav1.5: an electrophysiological comparison of 'neonatal' and 'adult' isoforms and critical involvement of a lysine residue.",
    "abstract": "In developmentally regulated D1:S3 splicing of Nav1.5, there are 31 nucleotide differences between the 5'-exon ('neonatal') and the 3'-exon ('adult') forms, resulting in 7 amino acid differences in D1:S3-S3/S4 linker. In particular, splicing replaces a conserved negative aspartate residue in the 'adult' with a positive lysine. Here, 'neonatal' and 'adult' Nav1.5 alpha-subunit splice variants were stably transfected into EBNA-293 cells and their electrophysiological properties investigated by whole-cell patch-clamp recording. Compared with the 'adult' isoform, the 'neonatal' channel exhibited (1) a depolarized threshold of activation and voltage at which the current peaked; (2) much slower kinetics of activation and inactivation; (3) 50% greater transient charge (Na(+)) influx; (4) a stronger voltage dependence of time to peak; and (5) a slower recovery from inactivation. Tetrodotoxin sensitivity and VGSCbeta1-4 mRNA expression levels did not change. The significance of the charge-reversing aspartate to lysine substitution was investigated by mutating the lysine in the 'neonatal' channel back to aspartate. In this 'neonatal K211D' mutant, the electrophysiological parameters studied strongly shifted back towards the 'adult', that is the lysine residue was primarily responsible for the electrophysiological effects of Nav1.5 D1:S3 splicing. Taken together, these data suggest that the charge reversal in 'neonatal' Nav1.5 would (1) modify the channel kinetics and (2) prolong the resultant current, allowing greater intracellular Na(+) influx. Developmental and pathophysiological consequences of such differences are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Sarcopenia (skeletal muscle wasting with aging) is thought to underlie a number of serious age-related health issues. While it may be seen as inevitable, decreasing this gradual loss of muscle is vital for healthy aging. Thus, it is imperative to investigate exercise and nutrition-based strategies designed to build a reservoir of muscle mass as early as possible. Elderly individuals are still able to respond to both resistance training and the anabolic signals provided by protein ingestion, provided specific amino acids, such as leucine, are present. Whey proteins are a rich source of these essential amino acids and rapidly elevate plasma amino acids, thus providing the foundations for preservation of muscle mass. Several studies involving supplementation with whey protein have been shown to be effective in augmenting the effects of resistance exercise, particularly when supplementation occurs in the hours surrounding the exercise training. While further work is required, particularly in elderly people, simple dietary and exercise strategies that may improve the maintenance of skeletal muscle mass will likely result in a decrease in the overall burden of a number of diseases and improve the quality of life as we age.",

    "title": "Site directed mutagenesis of Drosophila flightin disrupts phosphorylation and impairs flight muscle structure and mechanics.",
    "abstract": "Flightin is a myosin rod binding protein that in Drosophila melanogaster is expressed exclusively in the asynchronous indirect flight muscles (IFM). Hyperphosphorylation of flightin coincides with the completion of myofibril assembly and precedes the emergence of flight competency in young adults. To investigate the role of flightin phosphorylation in vivo we generated three flightin null (fln(0)) Drosophila strains that express a mutant flightin transgene with two (Thr158, Ser 162), three (Ser139, Ser141, Ser145) or all five potential phosphorylation sites mutated to alanines. These amino acid substitutions result in lower than normal levels of flightin accumulation and transgenic strains that are unable to beat their wings. On two dimensional gels of IFM proteins, the transgenic strain with five mutant sites (fln(5STA)) is devoid of all phosphovariants, the transgenic strain with two mutant sites (fln(2TSA)) expresses only the two least acidic of the nine phosphovariants, and the transgenic strain with three mutant sites (fln(3SA)) expresses all nine phosphovariants, as the wild-type strain. These results suggest that phosphorylation of Thr158 and/or Ser162 is necessary for subsequent phosphorylation of other sites. All three transgenic strains show normal, albeit long, IFM sarcomeres in newly eclosed adults. In contrast, sarcomeres in fully mature fln(5STA) and fln(2TSA) adults show extensive breakdown while those in fln(3SA) are not as disordered. The fiber hypercontraction phenotype that characterizes fln(0) is fully evident in fln(5STA) and fln(2TSA) but partially rescued in fln(3SA). Mechanics on skinned fibers from newly eclosed flies show alterations in viscous modulus for fln(5STA) and fln(2TSA) that result in a significant reduction in oscillatory power output. Expression of fln(5STA) and fln(2TSA), but not fln(3SA), in a wild-type (fln(+)/fln(+)) background resulted in a dominant negative effect manifested as flight impairments and hypercontracted IFM fibers. Our studies indicate that Thr158 and/or Ser162 are (is) indispensable for flightin function and suggest that phosphorylation of one or both residues fulfills an essential role in IFM structural stability and mechanics.",

    "abstract": "With the goal to investigate the structural impact of O-mannosyl glycosylation on alpha-dystroglycan, a glycoprotein that has an important role in the extracellular organization of muscle, glycopeptides derived from its mucin-like sequence have been prepared by solid-phase peptide synthesis. Two approaches have been explored to obtain needed mannosylated serine and threonine building blocks. With the alpha-carboxyl group unprotected, and with tetraaceto-1-fluoro-alpha-D-mannose as the sugar donor, the desired alpha-O-mannosyl-Fmoc-Ser/Thr formed, along with mannosyl ester isomers and the species with mannose attached to both hydroxyl and carboxyl functions. Relevant mechanistic questions and stability issues were elucidated. Alternatively, building blocks were made with the alpha-carboxyl protected/activated as the pentafluorophenyl (Pfp) ester. Glycopeptides synthesized herein contained 5-9 residues, and featured one, two, and four consecutive Ser and/or Thr residues O-glycosylated with mannose. Circular dichroism (CD) spectra for Man-containing glycopeptides recorded in water show them to be not well ordered. For one of the alpha-dystroglycan-derived sequences, the comparative conformational consequences of glycosylation by either Man or GalNAc have been examined by CD and NMR, with both methods showing a more organized structure when GalNAc is present.",

To explore protein-protein interactions that may mediate these functions, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening on an embryonic rat lens library using Cdk5 and its regulators, p35 and p39 as baits. This screen identified an interaction between p39 and non-muscle myosin essential light chain (MLC(17)). GST pull-down experiments demonstrated that p39 binds directly to MLC(17) through a strong binding site in the N-terminal 109 amino acids of p39. Immunoprecipitation of proteins from Cos1 cells co-transfected with GFP-MLC(17) and HA-p39 confirmed that these proteins interact intracellularly. Immunofluorescence microscopy of co-transfected lens epithelial cells showed that GFP-MLC(17) and HA-p39 co-localize along cytoskeletal fibrils. Moreover, endogenous rat lens p39 co-immunoprecipitated with MLC(17) and myosin heavy chain II (MHC II), demonstrating that the interaction is physiological and serves to link p39 to the cytoskeleton.",

    "abstract": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) produced by epithelial and inflammatory cells are key mediators of the chronic airway inflammation of asthma. Low L-arginine levels can result in the uncoupling of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) leading to production of both ROS and RNS. Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) is a competitive endogenous inhibitor of all NOS isoforms and has been demonstrated to inhibit NO formation and increase oxidative stress in vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells. The effect of ADMA on inducible NOS (iNOS) activity in epithelial cells has not been explored. In this study, we investigated whether addition of exogenous ADMA alters the generation of NO and superoxide anion (O2-), leading to peroxynitrite (ONOO-) formation in a mouse epithelial cell line. In stimulated LA-4 cells, ADMA dose-dependently inhibited nitrite accumulation after 24 h of treatment. In addition, ADMA concentrations as low as 10 microM induced rapid increases in O2- production as measured by dihydroethidium oxidation. Furthermore, using dihydrorhodamine to monitor ONOO- formation, ADMA caused a dose-dependent increase in ONOO- after treatment for 24 h. Similar effects of ADMA were seen using purified iNOS protein in a cell-free system. Together, these data indicate that elevated ADMA may contribute to the production of ROS and RNS in airway inflammation.",

    "title": "Long-chain omega-3 fatty acids regulate bovine whole-body protein metabolism by promoting muscle insulin signalling to the Akt-mTOR-S6K1 pathway and insulin sensitivity.",
    "abstract": "The ability of the skeletal musculature to use amino acids to build or renew constitutive proteins is gradually lost with age and this is partly due to a decline in skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity. Since long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCn-3PUFA) from fish oil are known to improve insulin-mediated glucose metabolism in insulin-resistant states, their potential role in regulating insulin-mediated protein metabolism was investigated in this study. Experimental data are based on a switchback design composed of three 5 week experimental periods using six growing steers to compare the effect of a continuous abomasal infusion of LCn-3PUFA-rich menhaden oil with an iso-energetic control oil mixture. Clamp and insulin signalling observations were combined with additional data from a second cohort of six steers. We found that enteral LCn-3PUFA potentiate insulin action by increasing the insulin-stimulated whole-body disposal of amino acids from 152 to 308 micromol kg(-1) h(-1) (P=0.006). The study further showed that in the fed steady-state, chronic adaptation to LCn-3PUFA induces greater activation (P<0.05) of the Akt-mTOR-S6K1 signalling pathway. Simultaneously, whole-body total flux of phenylalanine was reduced from 87 to 67 micromol kg(-1) h(-1) (P=0.04) and oxidative metabolism was decreased (P=0.05). We conclude that chronic feeding of menhaden oil provides a novel nutritional mean to enhance insulin-sensitive aspects of protein metabolism.",

    "abstract": "An actin filament with heat acceptors attached to its Cys374 residue in each actin monomer could move unidirectionally even under heat pulsation alone, while in the total absence of both ATP and myosin. The prime driver for the movement was temperature gradients operating between locally heated portions on an actin filament and its cooler surroundings. In this report, we investigated how the mitigation of the temperature gradients induces a unidirectional movement of an actin filament. We then observed the transversal fluctuations of the filament in response to heat pulsation and their transition into longitudinally unidirectional movement. The transition was significantly accelerated when Cys374 and Lys336 were simultaneously excited within an actin monomer. These results suggest that the mitigation of the temperature gradients within each actin monomer first went through the energy transformation to transversal fluctuations of the filament, and then followed by the transformation further down to longitudinal movements of the filament. The faster mitigation of temperature gradients within actin monomer helps build up the transition from the transversal to longitudinal movements of the filament by coordinating the interaction between the neighboring monomers.",

    "title": "Effects of oxidative stress on the cardiac myocyte proteome: modifications to peroxiredoxins and small heat shock proteins.",
    "abstract": "Endogenous oxidative stress is a likely cause of cardiac myocyte death in vivo. We examined the early (0-2 h) changes in the proteome of isolated cardiac myocytes from neonatal rats exposed to H2O2 (0.1 mM), focussing on proteins with apparent molecular masses of between 20 and 30 kDa. Proteins were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DGE), located by silver-staining and identified by mass spectrometry. Incorporation of [35S]methionine or 32Pi was also studied. For selected proteins, transcript abundance was examined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Of the 38 protein spots in the region, 23 were identified. Two families showed changes in 2DGE migration or abundance with H2O2 treatment: the peroxiredoxins and two small heat shock protein (Hsp) family members: heat shock 27 kDa protein 1 (Hsp25) and alphaB-crystallin. Peroxiredoxins shifted to lower pI values and this was probably attributable to 'over-oxidation' of active site Cys-residues. Hsp25 also shifted to lower pI values but this was attributable to phosphorylation. alphaB-crystallin migration was unchanged but its abundance decreased. Transcripts encoding peroxiredoxins 2 and 5 increased significantly. In addition, 10 further proteins were identified. For two (glutathione S-transferase pi, translationally-controlled tumour protein), we could not find any previous references indicating their occurrence in cardiac myocytes. We conclude that exposure of cardiac myocytes to oxidative stress causes post-translational modification in two protein families involved in cytoprotection. These changes may be potentially useful diagnostically. In the short term, oxidative stress causes few detectable changes in global protein abundance as assessed by silver-staining.",

    "abstract": "A major consequence of muscular dystrophy is that increased membrane fragility leads to high calcium influx and results in muscle degeneration and myonecrosis. Prior reports have demonstrated that increased nitric oxide production via L-arginine treatment of normal and mdx mice resulted in increased expression of utrophin and increased activation of muscle satellite cells, which could ameliorate the dystrophic pathology. We delivered L-arginine to normal and mdx mice, and examined muscles for any functional changes associated with its administration. Treated mdx muscles were less susceptible to contraction-induced damage and exhibited a rightward shift of the force-frequency relationship. Immunoblotting revealed increases in utrophin and gamma-sarcoglycan in the treated muscles. There was also a decrease in Evans blue dye uptake, indicating a reduction in myonecrosis. However, there was no decrease in serum creatine kinase or the proportion of central nuclei, nor any improvement in specific force. Together, these results show that L-arginine treatment can be beneficial to mdx muscle function, perhaps through a combination of enhanced calcium handling and increased utrophin, thereby decreasing muscle degeneration.",

    "abstract": "Myocardial dysfunction in the absence of myocardial ischemia is frequent in patients with diabetes mellitus but the underlying pathomechanism is unclear. We investigated whether accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in the diabetic myocardium is related to its functional abnormalities. In 11 male homozygous Zucker diabetic fatty rats (ZDF/Gmi-fa/fa) aged 37 weeks (OBESE) and 11 non-obese, non-diabetic littermates (LEAN), we measured left ventricular function (pressure-volume catheter) and levels of N(epsilon)-(carboxymethyl) lysine (CML), a prototypical AGE, in serum and the left ventricle (competitive enzyme linked immuno-assay). Overt diabetes mellitus (HbA1c > 9%) was present in all OBESE animals but not in LEAN. Systolic left ventricular function was not different between the groups, but the markers of left ventricular relaxation, dP/dt(min) and the relaxation constant tau, were impaired in OBESE. In parallel, CML levels were increased in serum (273 +/- 15 vs. 197 +/- 10 ng/ml, p<0.05) and in the left ventricle (18.4 +/- 1.1 vs. 12.5 +/- 2.0 ng/mg protein, p < 0.05) in OBESE compared to LEAN. There was a linear correlation between tau and the left ventricular CML levels (r = 0.65; p < 0.05). We conclude that type 2 diabetes is associated with predominant left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.

    "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is complicated by cytokine-driven alterations in protein and energy metabolism and consequent muscle wasting (cachexia). The aim of this randomised controlled trial was to investigate the efficacy of a mixture of beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate, glutamine and arginine (HMB/GLN/ARG) as nutritional treatment for rheumatoid cachexia. Forty RA patients supplemented their diet with either HMB/GLN/ARG or a nitrogen (7.19 g/day) and calorie (180 kcal/day) balanced mixture of alanine, glutamic acid, glycine, and serine (placebo) for 12 weeks. Body composition and other outcomes were assessed at baseline and follow-up, and analysed by mixed ANOVA. Dietary supplementation with HMB/GLN/ARG was not superior to placebo in the treatment of rheumatoid cachexia (groupxtime interactions P>0.05 for all outcomes). Both amino acid mixtures significantly increased (main effect of time) fat-free mass (727+/-1186 g, P<0.01), total body protein (719+/-1703 g, P=0.02), arms (112+/-183 g, P<0.01) and legs (283+/-534 g, P<0.01) lean mass, and some measures of physical function. No significant adverse event occurred during the study, but patients in the HMB/GLN/ARG group reported fewer gastrointestinal complaints compared to placebo. Dietary supplementation with HMB/GLN/ARG is better tolerated but not more effective in reversing cachexia in RA patients compared to the mixture of other non-essential amino acids used as placebo. Further controlled studies are necessary to confirm the beneficial anabolic and functional effects of increased nitrogen intake in this population.",

    "title": "Anabolic signaling deficits underlie amino acid resistance of wasting, aging muscle.",
    "abstract": "The nature of the deficit underlying age-related muscle wasting remains controversial. To test whether it could be due to a poor anabolic response to dietary amino acids, we measured the rates of myofibrillar and sarcoplasmic muscle protein synthesis (MPS) in 44 healthy young and old men, of similar body build, after ingesting different amounts of essential amino acids (EAA). Basal rates of MPS were indistinguishable, but the elderly showed less anabolic sensitivity and responsiveness of MPS to EAA, possibly due to decreased intramuscular expression, and activation (phosphorylation) after EAA, of amino acid sensing/signaling proteins (mammalian target of rapamycin, mTOR; p70 S6 kinase, or p70(S6k); eukaryotic initiation factor [eIF]4BP-1; and eIF2B). The effects were independent of insulin signaling since plasma insulin was clamped at basal values. Associated with the anabolic deficits were marked increases in NFkappaB, the inflammation-associated transcription factor. These results demonstrate first, EAA stimulate MPS independently of increased insulin availability; second, in the elderly, a deficit in MPS in the basal state is unlikely; and third, the decreased sensitivity and responsiveness of MPS to EAA, associated with decrements in the expression and activation of components of anabolic signaling pathways, are probably major contributors to the failure of muscle maintenance in the elderly. Countermeasures to maximize muscle maintenance should target these deficits.",

    "title": "Distinct dynamics and distribution of histone methyl-lysine derivatives in mouse development.",
    "abstract": "Histone methylation acts as an epigenetic regulator of chromatin activity through the modification of arginine and lysine residues on histones H3 and H4. In the case of lysine, this includes the formation of mono-, di-, or trimethyl groups, each of which is presumed to represent a distinct functional state at the cellular level. To examine the potential developmental roles of these modifications, we determined the global patterns of lysine methylation involving K9 on histone H3 and K20 on histone H4 in midgestation mouse embryos. For each lysine target site, we observed distinct subnuclear distributions of the mono- and trimethyl versions in 10T1/2 cells that were conserved within primary cultures and within the 3D-tissue architecture of the embryo. Interestingly, three of these modifications, histone H3 trimethyl K9, histone H4 monomethyl K20, and histone H4 trimethyl K20 exhibited marked differences in their distribution within the neuroepithelium. Specifically, both histone H3 trimethyl K9 and H4 monomethyl K20 were elevated in proliferating cells of the neural tube, which in the case of the K9 modification was limited to mitotic cells on the luminal surface. In contrast, histone H4 trimethyl K20 was progressively lost from these medial regions and became enriched in differentiating neurons in the ventrolateral neural tube. The inverse relationship of histone H4 K20 methyl derivatives is even more striking during skeletal and cardiac myogenesis where the accumulation of the trimethyl modification in pericentromeric heterochromatin suggests a role in gene silencing in postmitotic muscle cells. Importantly, our results establish that histone lysine methylation occurs in a highly dynamic manner that is consistent with their function in an epigenetic program for cell division and differentiation.",

    "title": "Effect of plasma insulin and branched-chain amino acids on skeletal muscle protein synthesis in fasted lambs.",
    "abstract": "The increase in fractional rate of protein synthesis (Ks) in the skeletal muscle of growing rats during the transition from fasted to fed state has been explained by the synergistic action of a rise in plasma insulin and branched-chain amino acids (BCAA). Since growing lambs also exhibit an increase in Ks with level of feed intake, the objective of the present study was to determine if this synergistic relationship between insulin and BCAA also occurs in ruminant animals. Six 30 kg fasted (72 h) lambs (8 months of age) received each of four treatments, which were based on continuous infusion into the jugular vein for 6 h of: (1) saline (155 mmol NaCl/l); (2) a mixture of BCAA (0.778 micromol leucine, 0.640 micromol isoleucine and 0.693 micromol valine/min.kg); (3) 18.7 micromol glucose/min.kg (to induce endogenous insulin secretion); (4) co-infusion of BCAA and glucose. Within each period all animals received the same isotope of phenylalanine (Phe) as follows: (1) L-[1-13C]Phe; (2) L-phenyl-[ring 2H5]-alanine; (3) L-[15N]Phe; (4) L-[ring 2,6-3H]Phe. Blood was sampled serially during infusions to measure plasma concentrations of insulin, glucose and amino acids, and plasma free Phe isotopic activity; biopsies were taken 6 h after the beginning of infusions to determine Ks in m. longissimus dorsi and vastus muscle. Compared with control (saline-infused) lambs, Ks was increased by an average of 40% at the end of glucose infusion, but this effect was not statistically significant in either of the muscles sampled. BCAA infusion, alone or in combination with glucose, also had no significant effect on Ks compared with control sheep. Ks was approximately 60% greater for vastus muscle than for m. longissimus dorsi (P<0.01), regardless of treatment. It is concluded that there are signals other than insulin and BCAA that are responsible for the feed-induced increase in Ks in muscle of growing ruminant animals.",

    "abstract": "Angiogenesis is the process of new vessel formation from an existing vasculature network. In all but a few circumstances it is tightly controlled and suppressed. Precise understanding of the factors involved in modulation of angiogenesis has significant potential clinical value. One agent believed to play a role in angiogenesis is nitric oxide. However, there remain substantial uncertainties concerning the specifics of this role. The present study was undertaken to better define the role nitric oxide plays in angiogenesis associated with acute wound healing. Muscle biopsies from the pectoralis major of C57B6 mice were embedded in 500 microl of type I collagen matrix, and incubated in the presence of growth medium for 14 days. Treatment wells received L-Arginine (2 mM), L-NAME (300 microM), or SNAP (10-20 microM). Angiogenic response was quantified as the measure of cell migration through the matrix and as the total cells recovered from the matrix. Whole lung specimens and aortic segments served as sources of endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells respectively for proliferation studies under similar treatment conditions. Nitric oxide was found to exert either a stimulatory or inhibitory effect on angiogenesis and cell proliferation that was subject to the assay system and specific vascular cell types present. These results suggest that the role of nitric oxide in angiogenesis is context dependent.",

We analyzed the modulatory effects of nitric oxide (NO) on the spike frequency of the reflex response. Bath application of L-arginine and SNAP, which elevate endogenous and exogenous NO levels, increased the frequency of the evoked response, whereas the application of L-NAME and PTIO, which reduce NO levels, decreased the frequency of the response. To determine through what pathway and target NO exerted these effects we bath applied ODQ, an inhibitor of soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC), which decreased the frequency of response, and 8-br-cGMP, which increased the spike frequency of response. To provide further evidence that NO acts via sGC, we elevated NO levels with L-arginine while simultaneously inhibiting sGC with ODQ. This application reduced the response to control levels, indicating that NO in the terminal ganglion of crayfish acts via sGC to modulate cGMP levels, which in turn regulate the responses of the uropod motor neurons.",

    "abstract": "Desmin myopathy is a familial or sporadic disorder characterized by the presence of desmin mutations that cause skeletal muscle weakness associated with cardiac conduction block, arrhythmia and heart failure. Distinctive histopathologic features include intracytoplasmic accumulation of desmin-reactive deposits and electron-dense granular aggregates in skeletal and cardiac muscle cells. We describe two families with features of adult-onset slowly progressive skeletal myopathy without cardiomyopathy. N342D point mutation was present in the desmin helical rod domain in patients of family 1, and I451M mutation was found in the non-helical tail domain in patients of family 2. Of interest, the same I451M mutation has previously been reported in patients with cardiomyopathy and no signs of skeletal myopathy. Some carriers of the I451M mutation did not develop any disease, suggesting incomplete penetrance. Expression studies demonstrated inability of the N342D mutant desmin to form cellular filamentous network, confirming the pathogenic role of this mutation, but the network was not affected by the tail-domain I451M mutation. Progressive skeletal myopathy is a rare phenotypic variant of desmin myopathy allelic to the more frequent cardio-skeletal form.",

    "abstract": "Polycystin-2 (PC2) is the product of the second cloned gene (PKD2) responsible for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease and has recently been shown to be a calcium-permeable cation channel. PC2 has been shown to connect indirectly with the actin microfilament. Here, we report a direct association between PC2 and the actin microfilament. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified a specific interaction between the PC2 cytoplasmic C-terminal domain and tropomyosin-1 (TM-1), a component of the actin microfilament complex. Tropomyosins constitute a protein family of more than 20 isoforms arising mainly from alternative splicing and are present in muscle as well as non-muscle cells. We identified a new TM-1 splicing isoform in kidney and heart (TM-1a) that differs from TM-1 in the C terminus and interacted with PC2. In vitro biochemical methods, including GST pull-down, blot overlay and microtiter binding assays, confirmed the interaction between PC2 and the two TM-1 isoforms. Further experiments targeted the interacting domains to G821-R878 of PC2 and A152-E196, a common segment of TM-1 and TM-1a. Indirect double immunofluorescence experiments showed partial co-localization of PC2 and TM-1 in transfected mouse fibroblast NIH 3T3 cells. Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) studies using 3T3 cells and Xenopus oocytes co-expressing PC2 and TM-1 (or TM-1a) revealed in vivo association between the protein pairs. Furthermore, the in vivo interaction between the endogenous PC2 and TM-1 was demonstrated also by reciprocal co-IP using native human embryonic kidney cells and human adult kidney. Considering previous reports that TM-1 acts as a suppressor of neoplastic growth of transformed cells, it is possible that TM-1 contributes to cyst formation/growth when the anchorage of PC2 to the actin microfilament via TM-1 is altered.",

NPY (10(-8) M) increased protein mass of cardiomyocytes from 16-week-old SHRs by 9.2 +/- 2.1% (n = 8, P < 0.05). De novo protein synthesis was increased maximally in SHRs at 12, 16, and 20 weeks (P < 0.05, n = 8) in response to NPY by 12.6 +/- 2.1% (10(-6) M), 20.1 +/- 4.2% (10(-8) M), and 9.4 +/- 1.8% (10(-7) M), respectively.

Here we use lysine scanning mutagenesis to determine the orientation of residue side chains toward core hydrophobic or surface hydrophilic environments and use this information to build a structural model of the ligand binding region of the AChR from adult human muscle. The resulting side-chain orientations allow assignment of residue equivalence between AChR subunits and an acetylcholine binding protein solved by x-ray crystallography, providing the foundation for homology modeling. The resulting structural model of the AChR provides a picture of the ACh binding site and predicts novel pairs of residues that stabilize subunit interfaces. The overall results suggest that lysine scanning can provide the basis for structural modeling of other members of the AChR superfamily as well as of other proteins with repeating structures delimiting a hydrophobic core.",

Since l-proline is essential for the synthesis of collagen, we examined whether TGF-beta 1 regulates the transcellular transport of l-proline by vascular SMCs. l-Proline uptake by vascular SMCs was primarily sodium-dependent, pH-sensitive, blocked by neutral amino acids and alpha-(methylamino)isobutyric acid, and exhibited trans-inhibition. Treatment of SMCs with TGF-beta 1 stimulated l-proline transport in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. The TGF-beta 1-mediated l-proline uptake was inhibited by cycloheximide or actinomycin D. Kinetic studies indicated that TGF-beta 1-induced l-proline transport was mediated by an increase in transport capacity independent of any changes in the affinity for l-proline. TGF-beta 1 stimulated the expression of system A amino acid transporter 2 (SAT2) mRNA in a time-dependent fashion that paralleled the increase in l-proline transport. Reverse transcriptase PCR failed to detect the presence of SAT1 or amino acid transporter 3 (ATA3) in either untreated or TGF-beta 1-treated SMCs. These results demonstrate that l-proline transport by vascular SMCs is mediated predominantly by the SAT and that TGF-beta 1 stimulates SMC l-proline uptake by inducing the expression of the SAT2 gene. The ability of TGF-beta 1 to induce SAT2 expression may function to provide SMCs with the necessary levels of l-proline required for collagen synthesis and cell growth.",

    "title": "The interaction of dystrophin with beta-dystroglycan is regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation.",
    "abstract": "Dystrophin and the dystrophin-associated protein complex (DAPC) have recently been implicated in cell signalling events. These proteins are ideally placed to transduce signals from the extracellular matrix (ECM) to the cytoskeleton. Here we show that beta-dystroglycan is tyrosine-phosphorylated in C2/C4 mouse myotubes. Tyrosine phosphorylation was detected by mobility shifts on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (SDS-PAGE) and confirmed by immunoprecipitation and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The potential functional significance of this tyrosine phosphorylation was investigated using peptide 'SPOTs' assays. Phosphorylation of tyrosine in the 15 most C-terminal amino acids of beta-dystroglycan disrupts its interaction with dystrophin. The tyrosine residue in beta-dystroglycan's WW-binding motif PPPY appears to be the most crucial in disrupting the beta-dystroglycan-dystrophin interaction. beta-dystroglycan forms the essential link between dystrophin and the rest of the DAPC. This regulation by tyrosine phosphorylation may have implications in the pathogenesis and treatment of Duchenne's muscular dystrophy (DMD).",

    "abstract": "Increased plasma levels of endothelin-1 correlate with the severity of left ventricular hypertrophy in vivo. The aim of the study was to determine the relative contribution of stimulation of endothelin ET(A) and endothelin ET(B) receptors, and the associated activation of protein kinase C, to the hypertrophic response initiated by endothelin-1 in adult rat ventricular cardiomyocytes maintained in culture (24 h). Endothelin-1 (10(-7) M) increased the total mass of protein and the incorporation of [14C] phenylalanine into protein to 26% and 25% greater (P<0.05) than respective basal values. The total content of RNA and the incorporation of 2-[14C] uridine into RNA were increased by 23% and 21%, respectively, by endothelin-1 (10(-8) M). Actinomycin D (5x10(-6) M), an inhibitor of transcription, abolished the incorporation of [14C] phenylalanine and the increased protein mass elicited by endothelin-1 (10(-8) M). The selective agonists at the endothelin ET(B) receptor, sarafotoxin 6c (10(-7) M) and endothelin-3 (10(-7) M), increased the incorporation of [14C] phenylalanine to 13% and 13% greater than respective basal values. The incorporation of [14C]phenylalanine in response to endothelin-1 (10(-7) M) was reduced by 50% (P<0.05) by the selective antagonist at endothelin ET(A) receptors, ABT-627 (10(-9) M), while the response to sarafotoxin 6c was not attenuated. The selective antagonist at endothelin ET(B) receptors, A192621 (10(-10) M), abolished the response to sarafotoxin 6c (10(-7) M) and attenuated the response to endothelin-1 (10(-7) M) by 43% (P<0.05). The selective inhibitor of protein kinase C, bisindolylmaleimide (5x10(-6) M) attenuated the response to sarafotoxin 6c (10(-7) M) by 78% and that to endothelin-1 (10(-7) M), elicited in the presence of A192621 (10(-10) M), by 52%. In conclusion, these data implicate endothelin ET(B) receptors, in addition to endothelin ET(A) receptors, in endothelin-1-mediated cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and provide evidence for the involvement of protein kinase C, at least in part, in the hypertrophic signalling pathways associated with activation of each receptor subpopulation.",

    "abstract": "Glycogen phosphorylase is a muscle enzyme which metabolizes glycogen, producing glucose-1-phosphate, which can be used for the production of ATP. Phosphorylase activity is regulated by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation, and by the allosteric binding of numerous effectors. In this work, we have studied 10 site-directed mutants of glycogen phosphorylase (GP) in its amino-terminal regulatory region to characterize any changes that the mutations may have made on its structure or function. All of the GP mutants had normal levels of activity in the presence of the allosteric activator AMP. Some of the mutants were observed to have altered AMP-binding characteristics, however. R16A and R16E were activated at very low AMP concentration and crystallized at low temperature, like the phosphorylated form of GP, phosphorylase a, and unlike the dephospho-form, phosphorylase b. This indicates that even without phosphorylation, the structures of these mutants are more like phosphorylase a than phosphorylase b. These mutants were also very poorly phosphorylated in the presence of the inhibitor glucose, while phosphorylase b was phosphorylated normally with this inhibitor present. In contrast to R16A and R16E, four other mutants behaved like phosphorylase b after phosphorylation. R69E was only partially activated by phosphorylation, and I13G, R43E, and R43E/R69E were completely inactive after phosphorylation. We propose a model for the many functions of the amino terminus to explain the many varied effects of these mutations.",

    "title": "Abnormal renal medullary response to angiotensin II in SHR is corrected by long-term enalapril treatment.",
    "abstract": "This study tested the hypotheses that renal medullary blood flow (MBF) in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) has enhanced responsiveness to angiotensin (ANG) II and that long-term treatment with enalapril can correct this. MBF, measured by laser Doppler flowmetry in anesthetized rats, was not altered significantly by ANG II in Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats, but was reduced dose dependently (25% at 50 ng. kg(-1). min(-1)) in SHR. Infusion of N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) into the renal medulla unmasked ANG II sensitivity in WKY rats while L-arginine given into the renal medulla abolished the responses to ANG II in SHR. In 18- to 19-wk-old SHR treated with enalapril (25 mg. kg(-1). day(-1) when 4 to 14 wk old), ANG II did not alter MBF significantly, but sensitivity to ANG II was unmasked after L-NAME was infused into the renal medulla. Endothelium-dependent vasodilation (assessed with aortic rings) was significantly greater in treated SHR when compared with that in control SHR. These results indicate that MBF in SHR is sensitive to low-dose ANG II and suggest that this effect may be due to an impaired counterregulatory effect of nitric oxide. Long-term treatment with enalapril improves endothelium-dependent vascular relaxation and decreases the sensitivity of MBF to ANG II. These effects may be causally related to the persistent antihypertensive action of enalapril in SHR.",

    "title": "Site-directed mutants of glycogen phosphorylase are altered in their interaction with phosphorylase kinase.",
    "abstract": "Glycogen phosphorylase is found in resting muscle as phosphorylase b, which is inactive without AMP. Phosphorylation by phosphorylase kinase (PhK) produces phosphorylase a, which is active in the absence of AMP. PhK is the only kinase that can phosphorylate phosphorylase b, which in turn is the only physiological substrate for PhK. We have explored the reasons for this specificity and how these two enzymes recognize each other by studying site-directed mutants of glycogen phosphorylase. All mutants were assayed for changes in their interaction with a truncated form of the catalytic subunit of phosphorylase kinase, gamma(1-300). Five mutations (R69K, R69E, R43E, R43E/R69E, and E501A), made at sites that interact with the amino terminus in either phosphorylase b or a, showed little difference in phosphorylation by gamma(1-300) compared to wild-type phosphorylase b. Five mutations, made at three sites in the amino-terminal tail of phosphorylase (K11A, K11E, I13G, R16A, and R16E), however, produced decreases in catalytic efficiency for gamma(1-300), compared to that for phosphorylase b. R16E was the poorest substrate for gamma(1-300), giving a 47-fold decrease in catalytic efficiency. The amino terminus, and especially Arg 16, are very important factors for recognition of phosphorylase by gamma(1-300). A specific interaction between Lys 11 of phosphorylase and Glu 110 of gamma(1-300) was also confirmed. In addition, I13G and R16A were able to be phosphorylated by protein kinase A, which does not recognize native phosphorylase.",

    "title": "Inducible nitric oxide synthase-derived superoxide contributes to hypereactivity in small mesenteric arteries from a rat model of chronic heart failure.",
    "abstract": "The aims of this study were to (a) determine whether inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) is expressed in small mesenteric arteries from rats with chronic heart failure (CHF), (b) investigate the functional significance of this potential source of nitric oxide (NO) on vascular responsiveness and (c) investigate the role that superoxide plays in modulating vascular function in these arteries. CHF was induced in male Wistar rats by coronary artery ligation (CAL). In sham-operated rats the ligature was not tied but pulled under the artery. Six weeks after surgery CAL rats had left ventricular (LV) infarctions and elevated LV end-diastolic pressures. Immunoreactive iNOS was found in endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells and in the adventitia of small mesenteric arteries from CAL rats but not those from sham-operated rats. Third order mesenteric arteries (300-350 microm) were mounted in a small vessel pressure myograph. Endothelium-intact arteries from CAL rats were more responsive to phenylephrine (PE) than arteries from sham-operated rats (pD(2) value, CAL, 6.2+/-0.1; sham-operated, 5.9+/-0.1, P<0.05). Both the selective iNOS inhibitor, N-(3-(Aminomethyl) benzyl) acetamidine dihydrochloride (1400W; 10(-6) M) and the superoxide dismutase mimetic, Mn [III] tetrakis [1-methyl-4-pyridyl] porphyrin, (MnTMPyP; 10(-4) M) reversed the hyperesponsiveness (pD(2) values, 1400W, 5.9+/-0.1; MnTMPyP, 5.81+/-0.1, P<0.05). The NOS substrate, L-arginine (10(-3) M), reduced responsiveness of endothelium-denuded small mesenteric arteries from CAL rats (P<0.01). None of these drugs altered responses to PE in arteries from sham-operated rats. In summary, this study demonstrates that iNOS is expressed in mesenteric arteries from rats with CHF. However, instead of generating large quantities of NO, iNOS appears to be generating superoxide, perhaps because of a deficiency in its substrate, L-arginine. Increased superoxide generation from iNOS contributes to the hyperesponsive nature of endothelium-intact small mesenteric arteries from rats with CHF.",

    "abstract": "The abundance of a histidine residue at position 185 (His(185)) of the human corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) type 2 alpha receptor (hCRF(2alpha)) was investigated. His(185) has only been reported in hCRF(2); CRF(2) proteins from other species and all CRF(1) receptors encode an arginine (Arg(185)) at the corresponding position. Cloning of partial and full-length hCRF(2) cDNAs from a variety of neuronal and peripheral tissues revealed the existence of receptor molecules encoding Arg(185) only. Sequence analysis of the hCRF(2) gene verified the existence of Arg(185) also on genomic level. Full-length cDNAs encoding either the His(185) (R2H(185)) or the Arg(185) (R2R(185)) variants of hCRF(2alpha) were stably expressed in HEK293 cells and tested for ligand binding properties. In displacement studies R2H(185) and R2R(185) displayed a similar substrate specificity, human and rat urocortin, and the peptide antagonists astressin and alpha-helical CRF((9-41)) were bound with high affinity whereas human and ovine CRF were low-affinity ligands. Significant differences were observed for sauvagine and urotensin I, which bound with 3-fold (sauvagine) and 9-fold (urotensin I) higher affinity to R2R(185). These data indicate that hCRF(2), like all vertebrate CRF(1) and CRF(2) proteins encodes an arginine residue at the junction between extracellular domain 2 and transmembrane domain 3 and that this amino acid plays a role for the discrimination of some CRF peptide ligands.",

    "abstract": "Chronic administration of troglitazone might predispose to cardiac hypertrophy. The aims of the study were to determine if troglitazone could (i) initiate a trophic response directly in ventricular cardiomyocytes and (ii) modify responses to other trophic stimuli. After 24 h, troglitazone (10 nM-10 microM) (i) did not increase cellular protein mass and decreased incorporation of [14C]phenylalanine, a marker of protein synthesis, (ii) interacted with serum (10% v/v) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (10 nM) to produce small trophic responses, (iii) increased cellular protein mass but not protein synthesis with insulin (1 unit/ml). Troglitazone (1 microM) attenuated responses to phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) (100 nM), and noradrenaline (5 microM) and endothelin-1 (100 nM), which also activate protein kinase C. In summary, troglitazone does not initiate cardiomyocyte growth directly in vitro, and can inhibit protein kinase C-mediated growth mechanisms. However, the interaction of troglitazone with serum growth factors may contribute modestly to the development of hypertrophy. As troglitazone produced a moderate hypertrophic effect per se in re-differentiated cardiomyocytes, it may directly increase the severity of established hypertrophy.",

Neither superfusion with a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (10 or 100 micromol l-1), nor the addition of indomethacin (30 micromol l-1) to both perfusate and superfusate reduced the positive correlation between PK and flow velocity (U). 3. In the presence of agents known to raise intracellular levels of adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (noradrenaline, 8-bromo-cAMP and a combination of forskolin and rolipram) the slope of the relation between PK and U was no longer significant, so that PK was no longer flow dependent. 4. These results confirm that the flow dependence of PK is a biological process and not an artefact of measurement and suggest a role for intracellular cAMP rather than nitric oxide or prostacyclin in the flow-dependent modulation of PK in frog mesenteric microvessels.",

    "abstract": "Microvascular endothelial cells actively participate in local regulation of blood flow and blood-tissue exchange by producing various vasoactive substances including nitric oxide (NO). This study examined microcirculatory changes in the early stage of thermal injury and the NO-related mechanisms. Resistance arterioles of rat cremaster muscle were observed using intravital microscopy. Arteriolar diameter and flow velocity were measured and flow rate was calculated after administration of various vasoactive agonists in burns. In fluid-resuscitated rats with stable systemic blood pressure, microvascular caliber and blood flow were not significantly altered in the first hour following a 25% total body surface area full-thickness scald burn. Topical application of acetylcholine (ACh), an endothelium-dependent vasodilator, increased arteriolar diameter and flow rate in a dose-dependent fashion. The dose-responsive effects of ACh were significantly greater in burned rats than in sham-burned rats, and the augmentation was blocked by inhibition of NO production with NG-monomethyl-l-arginine (L-NMMA). Topical application of adenosine, an endothelium-independent vasodilator, and sodium nitroprusside, an exogenous NO donor, markedly increased arteriolar diameter and flow rate. The effects were not significantly different in burned and sham-burned animals, and the adenosine-induced vasodilation was not blocked by L-NMMA. These data suggest that endothelium-dependent and NO-mediated arteriolar dilation is enhanced in the early stage of thermal injury. This effect may play an important role in the pathophysiological events of microcirculation and blood-tissue exchange in burns.",

    "abstract": "Concentration-dependent changes in cyclic AMP (cAMP), site-specific phosphorylation of phospholamban, the intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) transient and contraction were measured in isolated rat ventricular myocytes exposed to the beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoprenaline. Cyclic AMP was measured by [125I]-cAMP scintillation proximity assay, phosphorylation of phospholamban at Ser16 and Thr17 was assessed using a pair of site-specific polyclonal antibodies, and [Ca2+]i was monitored with the fluorescent dye fura 2. Cyclic AMP rose to twice basal levels in the presence of 10(-6) M isoprenaline. The maximum increase in phosphorylation at Ser16 and Thr17 of phospholamban was seen at 10(-7) M isoprenaline. At this stage Ser16 phosphorylation was six times higher, and Thr17 phosphorylation was three times higher than that recorded in the absence of isoprenaline. Phosphorylation at Ser16 correlated more closely with changes in the [Ca2+]i transient and contraction than did phosphorylation at Thr17. This is the first study of its kind to measure simultaneous changes in cAMP, the phosphorylation of phospholamban, the [Ca2+]i transient and contraction over a range of concentrations of beta-agonist. The results suggest that phosphorylation of phospholamban at Thr17 is of lesser physiological relevance to the effects of beta-adrenergic stimulation on the heart than phosphorylation at Ser16.",

    "abstract": "This study examined whether consuming a (poly)phenol-rich food before strenuous muscle-damaging exercise can modify post-exercise markers of inflammation and oxidative stress. Using a double-blinded, randomised, placebo-controlled, between-subjects design, 26 recreationally active males (n = 15) and females (n = 11) consumed higher-(poly)phenol (H-POL) foods (dates, dark chocolate, pomegranate; 285.1 mg/day) or lower-(poly)phenol foods (L-POL) (cereal bar, milk chocolate, sports drink; 88.3 mg/day) for 3 days before, and then 30 min before, strenuous exercise (100 drop jumps, 50 squat jumps). A range of blood markers associated with inflammation (total and differential leukocytes, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-12, tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor), and oxidative stress (glutathione peroxidase (GPX), 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), and urinary 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG)) were quantified pre, immediately post, 1 and 2 h post-exercise. One hundred and nineteen plasma (poly)phenol metabolites were measured pre, immediately post and 1 h post-exercise. Total plasma (poly)phenol concentrations were greater in the H-POL vs. L-POL intervention, peaking 1 h post-exercise (H-POL: 239.5 ± 87.8 µM vs. L-POL 58.9 ± 33.8 µM; P < 0.001). There were interaction effects for IL-10 and TNF-α but no differences with post hoc tests. Urinary 8-OHdG excretion was higher in H-POL vs L-POL (condition effect; P < 0.001), whereas erythrocytes GPX activity was higher in the L-POL vs. H-POL (condition effect; P < 0.001). A (poly)phenol food intervention before exercise increased total plasma (poly)phenol concentrations but had limited and inconsistent effects on markers of inflammation and oxidative stress in the 2 h after strenuous exercise.",

    "abstract": "Physical exercise induces muscle damage and inflammation, particularly in non-trained individuals, leading to reduced performance. This study explores the influence of dietary patterns on exercise outcomes and systemic physiological biomarkers in this population. This is an observational study complemented by prospective short-term follow-up to assess the influence of diet on exercise-induced inflammation and muscle damage. Recreationally active volunteers (45 females and 33 males) answered a food frequency questionnaire corrected by FETA. A step-exercise was performed until exhaustion and plasma samples were obtained before (basal) and 2 h and 48 h post-exercise. Muscle damage biomarkers (creatine kinase, CK; lactate dehydrogenase, LDH activities) were evaluated through commercial kits and spectrophotometry, and 8 cytokines were assessed by multiplex ELISA. Principal components analysis (PCA) was applied to cytokine to derive systemic inflammatory scores, and muscle damage biomarkers were standardized to comparable scales. Structural equation modeling was then used to evaluate the latent nutritional pattern and its associations with inflammation, muscle damage, and exercise performance. A dietary pattern characterized by higher intake of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates positively influenced physical performance through muscle mass. PCA evidenced 2 inflammation scores (PC1 and PC2), which explained most of cytokine´s variance with opposing correlations with nutrients. PC1 had a negative correlation with proteins, unsaturated fats, folates and vitamin D, while PC2 had positive correlations with simple sugars, saturated fats, insoluble fiber and folates. Exercise volume influenced early systemic inflammation but had no effect on CK or LDH. No sex differences, other than muscle mass, were detected in the population. In healthy young non-athlete population, nutrient-rich dietary patterns appear to enhance exercise performance through muscle mass in both sexes. Healthy fat intake is a relevant factor modulating these responses and plays a role in inflammation and recovery.",

    "title": "Acute effects of dietary whey protein supplementation after endurance exercise on serum osteokine and inflammatory cytokine concentrations in endurance runners.",
    "abstract": "Endurance athletes have an increased risk of bone stress injuries due to high training and energy demands. Endurance training with inadequate recovery triggers a pro-inflammatory response, which can upregulate bone resorption for hours to days. Combined dietary protein and carbohydrate supplementation post-exercise has shown to attenuate bone resorption and pro-inflammatory cytokine responses, though the effect of dietary protein intake alone remains to be elucidated. This randomized cross-over, double-blinded study examined the acute effects of post-exercise protein supplementation on serum concentrations of osteokine and inflammatory cytokines in endurance runners. 14 young male and female (n=7 each) endurance runners with a weekly training distance ≥40 km were included. Participants underwent (i) a protein treatment (0.5g/kg whey isolate), and (ii) a control/water treatment; consumed immediately after a treadmill run to volitional exhaustion at 70% maximal oxygen consumption. Blood samples were taken at baseline, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 24h post-exercise, and analyzed with immunosorbent and multiplex assays. A linear mixed model assessed the effects of time and treatment for each marker, and interactions (sex, sequence, period, and baseline difference as covariates). There were no significant treatment by time effects for any blood markers. There were significant main effects of time for serum sclerostin (p<0.0001), dickkopf-1 (p<0.0001), osteoprotegerin (p<0.0001), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (p=0.004); these markers increased immediately post-exercise and returned to baseline by 24h. Acute whey protein supplementation did not induce a different bone or inflammatory response following exhaustive running exercise in young endurance runners compared to the control.",

    "title": "Exercise-specific plasma proteomic signatures in racehorses: Candidates for training adaptation and peak load monitoring.",
    "abstract": "Racehorses undergo profound physiological changes with training and competition, but current biomarkers inadequately capture the complex molecular dynamics of exercise. This study aimed to identify novel plasma biomarkers of training adaptation and peak load using high-throughput proteomics. We hypothesised that systematic training and racing induce distinct plasma proteomic signatures, enabling the discovery of candidate biomarkers linked to training status, oxidative stress, inflammation and metabolic remodelling. In vivo longitudinal study. Forty-nine Arabian and Thoroughbred racehorses underwent standardised high-intensity training. Plasma samples were collected at rest, immediately post-exercise and after recovery during three phases: initial training (T1), mid-season conditioning (T2) and race-phase (R). In total, 314 samples were analysed using tandem mass tags based quantitative proteomics and Orbitrap mass spectrometry. Protein abundance changes were assessed with multiple-testing correction (q < 0.05), and pathway enrichment was performed using STRING and ShinyGO. Proteomic responses differed by phase. T1 showed broad activation of inflammatory (S100A8/A9), antioxidant (superoxide dismutase 1, catalase) and metabolic proteins (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphoglycerate kinase 1). T2 displayed a more refined profile with remodelling and redox regulators (decorin, thymosin β4, glutathione S-transferase). Racing elicited the strongest response, with over 100 up-regulated proteins linked to energy metabolism, oxidative defense and cytoskeletal adaptation. Several proteins: including S100A8, thymosin β4, prothymosin-α, cofilin-1 and lipocalins, were consistently modulated across phases, highlighting their biomarker potential. Breed imbalance and incomplete follow-up sampling may affect generalisability. Validation in larger, diverse cohorts with targeted assays is required. This study identifies a panel of promising plasma proteins as candidate biomarkers of exercise adaptation and overload in racehorses. These findings may support improved monitoring of performance, training load and early detection of overtraining in equine athletes.",

Thirty-six athletes (24 men, 12 women; mean age 27.4 ± 4.1 years) were randomized into three groups: LD, IM, or Control. After a fatigue-inducing plyometric jump protocol, the LD and IM groups received six 30-minute recovery sessions over 72 h, while the Control group rested passively. Athletes were assessed at five time points-pre-exercise, immediately post-exercise, and a 24, 48, and 72 h-measuring perfusion (PU, Power Doppler Score), pressure pain threshold (PPT), maximal voluntary contraction (MVC), creatine kinase, C-reactive protein (CRP), and perceived recovery (TQR scale). Both IM and LD groups showed significantly greater increase in PPT at 24, 48, and 72 h compared to controls (p = 0.004-<0.001), with LD showing superior outcomes at 24 h. IM consistently increased perfusion (p < 0.001-0.026). LD also led to lower creatine kinase and CRP levels (p < 0.001-0.017). In conclusion, LD and IM enhanced muscle recovery after intense exercise, with LD showing stronger effects on pain, inflammation, and IM improving tissue perfusion.Clinical trial registration: Registered as a clinical trial under the number ISRCTN10033645.",

    "title": "The effectiveness of protein supplements on athletic performance and post-exercise recovery - a Bayesian multilevel meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.",
    "abstract": "Protein supplements are a popular category of dietary supplements among fitness enthusiasts and athletes. However, research providing definitive conclusions on the effects of protein on athletic performance and post-exercise recovery remains limited. Key factors, such as protein source, timing, and optimal dosage, require further investigation to clarify their impact. A systematic search across seven databases identified 6,129 studies, which were screened using the Covidence online tool. After independent selection, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment by two reviewers, 75 studies involving 1,206 athletes were included in the meta-analysis. A multilevel meta-analysis synthesized data from the included studies using a Bayesian hierarchical model with the brms package. Publication bias was assessed using a funnel plot generated with the PublicationBias package and by calculating the P value of Egger's test through the metafor package. Additionally, a moderation analysis with the brms package was conducted to examine the relationship between seven moderators and effect sizes. The results demonstrated that the effects of protein-carbohydrate supplements showed statistical significance in comparison to the placebo group [μ(SMD): 0.57, 95% CI: 0.2 to 0.93] in enhancing endurance performance. Pure protein supplements demonstrated statistically significant effects compared to the placebo group in both endurance performance [μ(SMD): 0.37, 95% CI: 0.02 to 0.71] and muscle strength [μ(SMD): 0.72, 95% CI: 0.18 to 1.27]. For post-exercise recovery, pure protein supplements also showed statistically significant effects compared to carbohydrate supplements for maintaining glycogen resynthesis [μ(SMD): 0.83, 95% CI: 0.21 to 1.46]. However, the results indicated that all significant effects were observed in randomized controlled trials where the energy intake between the intervention and control groups was not matched. The effects of protein supplementation on athletic performance and post-exercise recovery appear to be limited. Protein supplements showed beneficial effects compared to no supplementation. However, all statistically significant results were derived from studies in which energy intake was not matched between groups. This suggests that the observed benefits may not be attributable to protein per se. An additional intake of 1 g/kg/day of protein from supplements, resulting in a total daily protein intake of approximately 2 g/kg/day, appears to be most effective for enhancing athletic performance.

However, the acute hematological, metabolic, and inflammatory responses to masked versus unmasked HIIT in youth soccer players remain unclear. This study aimed to compare these responses during simulated 6000-ft masked and unmasked HIIT. Twelve male amateur soccer players completed two HIIT sessions in a randomized crossover design: one with a simulated 6000-ft training mask and one without. Each session consisted of identical high-intensity running intervals. Heart rate and oxygen saturation were monitored continuously. Blood samples were collected pre- and post-exercise to assess lactate, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, C-reactive protein, glucose, total cholesterol, free-fatty acids, insulin, cortisol, and creatine kinase. Paired statistical tests were used to compare pre- to post-exercise changes and between-condition differences. Both masked and unmasked sessions increased heart rate and reduced oxygen saturation compared with baseline, with no significant between-condition differences ( The simulated 6000-ft training mask augmented metabolic acidosis, hemoconcentration, and acute inflammatory stress without additional cardiovascular or arterial oxygen desaturation compared to unmasked HIIT. These findings suggest that such masks may provide a manageable yet heightened physiological stimulus, potentially useful for targeted training adaptations, provided hydration and recovery are carefully monitored.",

    "title": "Working like a mule? The physiological toll of heavy loads on mules.",
    "abstract": "Working mules are essential for human livelihoods, yet scientific evidence on their physiological limits during load-carrying tasks remains scarce. To evaluate the physiological responses of mules to increasing loads during short-distance work. A crossover design. For this, 12 Chilean Army mules of three sizes (small, medium, large) were subjected to a 2-km walk carrying loads of 0, 80, 105, and 130 kg, equivalent to 20-42% of live body weight, under ambient temperatures of 32-39 °C. Blood and physiological parameters were measured before, immediately after, 10 min, and 2 h after work, with additional blood samples for biochemical parameters collected up to 105 h after exercise. Linear mixed models were applied to evaluate the effects of load, time, and body size. The size of the mule did not have an effect on their physiological response to work. On the other hand, increasing load significantly elevated cortisol, lactate, and rectal temperature, indicating activation of both the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and anaerobic metabolism. Enzymatic activities of γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and alkaline phosphatase (SAP/ALP) also increased with heavier loads, suggesting greater muscular effort and mild tissue stress. Conversely, glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity decreased as load increased, implying increased oxidative demand. Total protein and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratios rose with higher loads, reflecting systemic stress response and hemoconcentration. Heart rate and respiratory rate were not significantly affected, suggesting adequate cardiovascular adaptation. Most parameters returned to baseline within 2 h post-exercise, demonstrating effective short-term recovery. These findings confirm that short-distance work carrying heavy loads, in particular over 105 kg, does activate a physiological stress response in mules, though within adaptive limits. Loads of 105-130 kg triggered greater metabolic and enzymatic adjustments, indicating that while trained mules can cope with high loads over short distances, care should be taken when asking mules to work for longer distances or heavier loads since it can negatively affect their welfare. Establishing evidence-based workload thresholds is essential for balancing performance efficiency and welfare in working mules. Future studies should evaluate long-term work under field conditions, incorporating other welfare indicators such as behavior for a more comprehensive welfare assessment.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to analyse the effects of a repeated sprint protocol on skin temperature (Tsk) and biochemical, neuromuscular, and psychophysiological indicators in university athletes. Thirty men, soccer and futsal players, and sedentary individuals, completed 15 maximal 30-m sprints with 1-min recovery intervals. Thermograms, biochemical samples, perceived recovery (TQR), and neuromuscular performance were collected 48 h before, immediately before, and 24 and 48 h after the intervention. Mean Tsk values for each region of interest (ROI) were used in the statistical analysis. A two-factor repeated-measures ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc adjustment was used to compare responses between groups over time. No significant difference was observed between groups for any variable. Over time, the protocol induced muscle damage and triggered an inflammatory response, with increases observed in creatine kinase (Δ = 181.6 u/L; p = 0.01), uric acid (Δ = 0.9 mg/dL; p < 0.001), and C-reactive protein (Δ = 1.1 mg/L; p = 0.005). Also, performance in countermovement jump (Δ = 3,4 cm; p < 0.001) and TQR scores decreased (Δ = 5.5 AU; p < 0.001) post-intervention. However, Tsk showed no significant changes in any ROI. In conclusion, Tsk was not a sensitive indicator for detecting muscle damage induced by repeated sprints. The protocol caused muscle damage in both trained and sedentary young men, and results suggest that physical activity level and training specificity did not influence most responses, except for TQR.",

This study assessed recovery, measured via high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), after game days in recreational female athletes and whether it differed by MC phase. Nineteen participants provided demographic and MC data and underwent point-of-care blood testing for hs-CRP on game day (GD) - 1, + 1, + 2, and + 3 on two occasions ( Compared to baseline (GD-1), hs-CRP was 25.0% (95% confidence interval:12.49,37.45) higher on GD + 1, 10.83% (- 1.66,23.31) higher on GD + 2 and returned to baseline by GD + 3 (- 3.20%(- 15.78,9.39)). Results were robust in adjusted models. A significant interaction between gameday and MC phase on hs-CRP revealed a 62.9% larger GD + 1 peak (40.31, 85.66) than GD-1 during the late luteal (LL) phase. Hs-CRP peaked on GD + 1, remained elevated on GD + 2, returned to baseline by GD + 3, with evidence suggesting inflammation was higher on GD + 1 in the LL phase.

    "title": "Impact of a single swimming session on inflammatory response and iron homeostasis in adolescent female athletes during the luteal phase.",
    "abstract": "The intensity and duration of physical activity significantly influence hepcidin levels, a vital hormone that manages iron balance. Its increase is associated with exercise-induced inflammation, particularly involving interleukin-6. This study explored the effect of a single swimming session on specific markers of inflammation and iron metabolism in young female athletes during the luteal phase of their menstrual cycle. Eighteen competitive swimmers (13.5 ± 1.2 years old) completed three distances (800 m, 200 m, and 50 m) in the shortest possible time with active recovery periods between segments. Venous blood samples were taken before exercise, immediately afterward, and after 3 h of recovery. Swimming has caused a significant increase in lactate and hypoxanthine, indicating a high level of exercise intensity. While no significant changes in hepcidin or IL-6 were observed at 3 h post-exercise, later time points were not assessed. Immediately following exercise, transferrin levels rose, while total iron-binding capacity declined. Despite the absence of an inflammatory response, mild adaptive changes were observed in selected indicators of iron metabolism. Alterations in concentrations of iron, erythroferrone, ferritin, transferrin, and red blood cell parameters suggest that responses within the iron regulatory system may occur independently of hepcidin activity, with notable contributions from ferritin, transferrin, and mechanisms related to erythropoietic activity.",

    "title": "Myokine IL-6 activity enhances post-exercise fatty acid accumulation in skeletal muscle but does not affect glycogen resynthesis.",
    "abstract": "During exercise, myokine interleukin 6 (IL-6) plays a variety of metabolic roles including acting as a muscular energy sensor and liberating somatic energy stores. While the effects of IL-6 are relatively well-defined during exercise, its role in muscular metabolism during exercise recovery in humans has not been addressed. To test whether myokine IL-6 allocates fat and glucose towards muscle, we conducted a randomized double-blind trial with 30 men (Age: 25.2 ± 3 yrs. BMI: 23.0 ± 1.5 kg/m2) where participants exercised at a moderate intensity for 2 h and received either tocilizumab to block IL-6 activity, or placebo. Continuous infusions of isotopically labeled palmitate, glucose, and glycerol paired with blood, breath, and muscle samples were used to measure muscle-specific metabolism. IL-6 blockade did not affect exercise performance, substrate utilization, or glucose, fatty acid and glycerol kinetics during exercise. During recovery, IL-6 blockade decreased the appearance of oral glucose and lowered the insulin response to a glucose drink. Despite this difference in glucose and insulin, the rate of post-exercise glycogen resynthesis before and after the ingestion of glucose was not altered between groups. Although IL-6 blockade did not affect lipolysis during exercise, it attenuated the accumulation of esterified oleate in muscle during recovery before the glucose drink was given. Furthermore, IL-6 blockade attenuated IL-1RA production in recovery but did not alter IL-10 secretion. Together, these results imply that during recovery from moderate-intensity exercise, myokine IL-6 primarily regulates fatty acid metabolism within muscle and leaves glucose metabolism largely unaffected.

    "title": "Tubastatin A attenuates impaired autophagic degradation and promotes myogenic program in skeletal muscle following downhill running.",
    "abstract": "Microtubule acetylation is known to promote autophagic degradation; however, its therapeutic potential in resolving exercise-induced autophagic flux blockage and facilitating injured muscle recovery remains unclear. In this study, Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with Tubastatin A for 3 consecutive days to enhance microtubule acetylation. Subsequently, the rats underwent a 90-minute downhill run at a gradient of -16°and a speed of 16 m·min⁻¹. Soleus muscles were sampled at 12 h post-exercise. Single muscle fibers were isolated and labelled with α-tubulin, acetylated α-tubulin (AcK40 α-tubulin), cytoplasmic dynein intermediate chain (dynein), or LC3 for immunofluorescent analysis. Protein expression of α-tubulin, AcK40 α-tubulin, dynein, LC3, p62, Myf5, Myod, and Myogenin were detected by Western blot. The results showed that Tubastatin A treatment significantly upregulated the expression of AcK40 α-tubulin and dynein. It also increased the amount of dynein on α-tubulin and promoted the retrograde transport of autophagosomes. In response to downhill running, Tubastatin A-treated rats exhibited enhanced autolysosome formation, along with reduced LC3-II and p62 expression. Additionally, Tubastatin A further potentiated the increases in MyoD and Myogenin induced by downhill running. These findings suggest that enhancing microtubule acetylation through Tubastatin A can mitigate the impairment of autophagosome degradation caused by downhill running and promote the myogenic program in skeletal muscle.",

    "title": "Acute and Intermittent Exogenous Ketosis to Support Recovery From Exercise and Adaptations to Exercise Training: A Narrative Review.",
    "abstract": "The ketone bodies acetoacetate (AcAc) and β-hydroxybutyrate (βHB) have pleiotropic effects in multiple organs including the brain, heart, and skeletal muscle by serving as an alternative substrate for energy provision, and by acting as a signaling molecule modulating inflammation, oxidative stress, anabolic and catabolic processes, and gene expression. Ketogenic precursors such as 1,3-butanediol and medium-chain fatty acids, and ketone body-containing compounds such as ketone salts and ketone esters are commercially available and collectively termed exogenous ketone supplements (EKS). Ingestion of EKS produces an acute transient (1-2 h) increase in circulating AcAc and βHB concentrations, which has been termed \"acute nutritional ketosis\" or \"intermittent exogenous ketosis\". Many studies have failed to observe benefits of acute ingestion of EKS on various tests of exercise capacity and performance, but recent studies, albeit small in number, have suggested beneficial effects of EKS on recovery, sleep, overreaching, and adaptation to exercise training. This review describes the rationale and potential mechanistic basis for the proposed effects of EKS on these outcomes, as well as critically appraising the existing literature in this field, which at present is largely exploratory and requires more human studies with ecologically valid designs to address important knowledge gaps.",

    "abstract": "Exercise-unacclimatized dromedary camels regularly perform strenuous work in desert heat; however, their short-term hematologic and biochemical recovery is not well defined. In this prospective repeated-measures experiment, seven healthy bulls underwent a standardized 90 min outdoor exercise bout, with blood sampled before exercise and at 0, 3, 6, 24, and 48 h of recovery. The analytical panel included hematology, primary hemostasis, electrolytes, osmolality, protein fractions, metabolites, and serum enzymes. Red-cell indices remained stable, indicating minimal erythrocyte mobilization, while bleeding time shortened sharply at 0 h and normalized by 3 h. Sodium and osmolality followed a biphasic pattern with an early rise at 3 h, a nadir at 6 h, and partial rebound by 24 h, whereas potassium and phosphate stayed depressed from 6 to 48 h. Proteins and glucose showed transient changes, and muscle-associated enzymes, especially lactate dehydrogenase, peaked early before declining. These findings demonstrate that camels tolerate combined exercise and heat stress but require up to 48 h to re-establish biochemical balance. The recovery timeline provides a clinically relevant framework for sampling, welfare monitoring, and management of work-rest cycles in desert environments.",

    "abstract": "Co-ingestion of carbohydrate and protein supplement (CHO-PRO) is a common strategy to enhance endurance performance. However, the optimal dose-response relationship has not been established, which limits evidence-based nutritional guidance for individuals. This study aimed to characterize the performance dose-response curve of a 4:1 CHO-PRO during prolonged rowing. In a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial, 171 physically active male university students (age: 23 ± 2 years) from non-sports majors each completed a single experimental session. Each session involved a rowing protocol consisting of two 30-min bouts. During the exercise, participants consumed one of eight distinct doses of a 4:1 CHO-PRO in aliquots every 15 min. The CHO delivery rates ranged from 0.5 to 1.2 g/kg/h. Total rowing distance served as the primary performance outcome and was analyzed using a one-way ANCOVA with baseline countermovement jump as a covariate. A significant quadratic (U-shaped) dose-response relationship was found for rowing performance. The lowest dose CHO-PRO (0.5 g/kg/h CHO) resulted in significantly greater rowing distance compared to several higher doses (0.9-1.2 g/kg/h). No significant main effect of supplement dose was observed for heart rate, blood lactate, blood glucose, or rating of perceived exertion during exercise. Post-exercise recovery markers also did not differ significantly between the groups. For prolonged rowing, a lower dose of the CHO-PRO was more effective than higher doses, revealing a non-linear performance response. This non-linear response was characterized by significant performance decrements at several higher intake levels. These findings underscore the importance of dose optimization. Exceeding a certain intake threshold may impair endurance performance.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the chronobiological effects of exercise timing, specifically morning versus evening sessions, on biochemical responses in elite boxers. While both high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) protocols were applied, the primary focus was to examine how the time-of-day influences markers of muscle damage, oxidative stress, and hormonal activity. Twenty-one elite male boxers completed four exercise sessions, two HIIT and two MICT, conducted in the morning and evening on separate days. Venous blood samples were collected immediately after each exercise session and again one-hour post-exercise. A 3 × 2 × 2 mixed-design ANOVA with repeated measures was used to analyze the effects of exercise type, time of day, and sampling time on biochemical markers. Significant differences were observed in all muscle and cardiac output biomarkers (LDH, CK, CK-MB, TnT, MB) across sampling times (rest, immediately post-exercise, and one-hour post-exercise). Additionally, CK levels showed a significant difference based on the time of day, with higher values recorded in evening sessions. Regarding oxidative stress parameters, a significant three-way interaction (exercise type × time of day × sampling time) was observed for malondialdehyde (MDA), a serum oxidant marker. IL-6 levels differed significantly by both time of day, with higher levels observed in morning sessions and sampling time, with elevated concentrations immediately after and 1 hour after exercise compared to rest. A significant interaction between time of day and sampling time was also detected for IL-6. Based on the findings of this study, both HIIT and MICT appear to induce more favorable biochemical responses when performed in the morning. Morning exercise sessions were associated with reduced markers of muscle damage, oxidative stress, and pro-inflammatory activity compared to evening sessions. Therefore, morning exercise may be recommended to optimize recovery, minimize physiological strain, and support overall athletic performance in elite athletes.",

A crossover study design was employed, involving 20 amateur female soccer players (age: 21.4 ± 1.8 years) who were randomly assigned to two groups. With a 15-day interval between sessions, participants underwent repeated assessments following 1v1 and 5v5 formats across two menstrual cycle phases (based on calendar estimates). Participants completed 1v1 and 5v5 sessions and were evaluated at four time points: at rest, immediately post-session, 24 hours post, and 48 hours post. A three-way repeated measures ANOVA was used to assess the effects of play format (1v1, 5v5), hormonal phase (early follicular, mid-luteal), and time (rest, post-exercise, 24h, 48h). RSI was assessed using a drop jump test, IL-6 was measured via salivary analysis, and DOMS was rated using a Likert scale. To control for potential confounders like nutrition, sleep, and training load, participants maintained their regular diet and training during the study, though individual variation in these factors could still affect the results. Significant interactions were found between menstrual cycle phase, format, and time for RSI (p = 0.040; ηp",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the effects of acute and repeated ischemic preconditioning (IPC) on recovery following high-intensity swim training. Thirty male amateur freestyle swimmers (21 ± 1 years, with at least 2 years of training experience) were randomly assigned to one of three groups: sham IPC (SHAM, n = 10, 4×5 min, 20 mmHg), acute IPC (AIPC, n = 10, 4×5 min, 220 mmHg), or repeated IPC (RIPC, n = 10, 7 days×4×5 min, 220 mmHg). A 7×200m swim incremental load training was conducted 20 minutes after the intervention. External load measures (grip strength, upper limb work, lower limb relative peak torque, average power) and internal load measures [limb circumferences, creatine kinase (CK), malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP)] were recorded at baseline, immediately, 24h and 48h post exercise. For external load, RIPC exhibited higher upper limb total work and average power than SHAM at all post-training points (",

    "abstract": "To assess the frequency and management of hypoglycaemia during unstructured physical activity (PA) in adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D) using automated insulin delivery (AID) systems in real-life settings. RAPPID is a prospective, multicenter, observational study conducted over 1 month in four French tertiary care centres. Adults with T1D using one of three AID systems (MiniMed 780G, Tandem t:slim X2 with Control-IQ, or Ypsopump with CamAPS FX) and performing ≥2 unstructured PA sessions per week were included. Participants completed paper logbooks documenting each PA session (type, intensity, hypoglycemia, adjustments). Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and pump data were downloaded. Glycaemic control was assessed using CGM-derived metrics within predefined peri-exercise time windows. Eighty-six participants (mean age 42.5 ± 14.3 years; 43% women; diabetes duration 23.6 ± 13.1 years; mean HbA1c 52 ± 7 mmol/mol (6.9% ± 0.6%)) reported 954 PA sessions (73% aerobic; 61% moderate intensity). TBR (<70 mg/dL) increased from 1% pre-exercise to 6% during and 5% post-exercise (early recovery phase). Clinical hypoglycaemia occurred in 20% of sessions (one-third of episodes were asymptomatic); 38% of participants experienced at least 1 level 2 event (<54 mg/dL). Anaerobic or high-intensity sessions were associated with lower hypoglycaemia risk. Temporary targets were used in 73% of sessions but initiated ≥1 h before PA in only 27%. Carbohydrate intake before and during PA was frequent but often suboptimally timed or dosed. Hypoglycemia remains common during and after PA in AID users. Suboptimal adjustment strategies and impaired symptom awareness contribute to risk. Individualised education remains essential to enhance safety.",

    "abstract": "Cold-water immersion (CWI), as a common recovery method, has been widely used in the field of post-exercise fatigue recovery. However, there is still a lack of comprehensive and systematic scientific evaluation of the combined effects of cold-water immersion combined with other therapies (CWI + Other). The aim of this study was to compare the effects of CWI and CWI + Other in post-exercise fatigue recovery and to explore the potential benefits of CWI + Other. We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library and EBSCO databases to include 24 studies (475 subjects in total) and performed a meta-analysis using standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The results showed that both CWI + Other (SMD = -0.68, 95% CI: -1.03 to -0.33) and CWI (SMD = -0.37, 95% CI: -0.65 to -0.10) were effective in reducing delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS). In subgroup analyses of athletes, both CWI + Other (SMD = -1.13, 95% CI: -1.76 to -0.49) and CWI (SMD = -0.47, 95% CI: -0.87 to -0.08) also demonstrated significant effects. In addition, CWI + Other significantly reduced post-exercise C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (SMD = -0.62, 95% CI: -1.12 to -0.13), and CWI with water temperatures higher than 10 °C also showed a CRP-lowering effect (MD = -0.18, 95% CI: -0.30 to -0.07), suggesting a potential benefit in anti-inflammation. There were no significant differences between the two interventions in the metrics of creatine kinase (CK; CWI: SMD = -0.01, 95% CI: -0.27 to 0.24; CWI + Other: SMD = 0.26, 95% CI: -0.51 to 1.03) or countermovement jump (CMJ; CWI: SMD = 0.22, 95% CI: -0.13 to 0.57; CWI + Other: SMD = 0.07, 95% CI: -0.70 to 0.85).",

To delve deeper into the molecular mechanisms that underlie these traits, researchers conducted a comprehensive analysis of transcriptomic and proteomic changes in Mongolian horses at three distinct time points: before, immediately after, and 24 h following a 20 km run. The transcriptomic analysis uncovered significant variations in gene expression patterns across these time points. Specifically, 291 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified when comparing pre-exercise to post-exercise conditions, 832 DEGs in the comparison between post-exercise and 24 h post-exercise, and 127 DEGs in the comparison of pre-exercise to 24 h post-exercise.

    "abstract": "Supervised exercise training (SET) for at least 3months is a cornerstone in the management of lower extremity peripheral artery disease (PAD). However, optimal duration of SET is discussed. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a short-duration program combining SET, nutritional advice and therapeutic education on maximal walking distance (MWD). Secondary objectives included assessing the impact of this program on smoking cessation, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) levels, optimization of medical therapy, and to identify factors associated with MWD improvement. We conducted a retrospective, monocentric study. Parameters assessed before and after the program included ankle-brachial index (ABI) at rest, MWD on treadmill, post-exercise ABI, and exercise transcutaneous oxygen pressure (TcPO2) using the Decrease from Rest of Oxygen Pressure (DROP). LDL-c levels, smoking status, and medical therapy were documented before and after the program. Forty-three patients (77% men, median age 67 [57-74]years) were included. The median program duration was 23.5 days [20.8-30.5], with 20.7h [16.8-25.1] of supervised physical activity. MWD increased significantly from 208m [139-294] to 251m [171-574] (P<0.001). Improvements in smoking status, LDL-c levels, and medical treatment optimization were also observed. Among all parameters, only the DROP TcPO2 before the program was significantly associated with MWD improvement (P<0.05). A short-duration program effectively improved median MWD (+56% [10-159%]), cardiovascular risk management, and was associated with baseline ischemia severity. These findings support the utility of shorter combined programs and the potential value of exercise TcPO2 in selecting responsive patients.",

Eleven untrained adolescent females at post-peak height velocity, aged 15-19 years, performed two trials (HIIR and HIIC) in a randomised order. Each participant performed a progressive incremental test for each mode of exercise to determine the > 90% max workload for the trials. The trials consisted of 8 bouts of 1 min of running or cycling at > 90% maximal workload with 1 min of passive recovery in between bouts. Blood samples were collected pre-exercise, 5- and 60-min post-exercise. Pro-inflammatory TNF-α, anti-inflammatory IL-10, IL-6 (pro-/anti-inflammatory), leptin and adiponectin were measured in serum. IL-6 increased at 5 min (time-effect: β = 0.656 ± - 0.277, p = 0.032) and 60 min following exercise compared to pre-exercise (time-effect: β = 1.036 ± 0.277, p = 0.001) in both trials. IL-10 started to increase immediately after exercise (time effect: β = 0.170 ± 0.069, p = 0.025) and peaked 60 min after exercise compared to pre-exercise (time effect: β = 0.317 ± 0.069, p < 0.001). TNF-α concentrations peaked 5 min only after HIIR (interaction effect: β = 2.777, p < 0.001). No change was observed in the IL-6/IL-10 ratio, but a significant decrease was observed in the TNF-α/IL-10 ratio 60 min post-exercise (time effect: β = - 0.269 ± 0.070, p = 0.001). Leptin decreased 60 min post-exercise compared to pre-exercise in both modes (time-effect: β = 0.155 ± 0.505, p = 0.004). No change was observed in adiponectin and the adiponectin/leptin ratio.

    "abstract": "Bone stress injuries are pervasive among endurance runners due to repetitive sport-specific mechanical loading and a higher prevalence of low energy availability (i.e., inadequate dietary energy intake relative to exercise energy expenditure). Chronic endurance exercise promotes bone formation, thus, runners typically have higher bone mineral density (BMD) than non-weightbearing athletes and sedentary individuals. However, runners may experience increased bone resorption for hours to days following an endurance exercise bout. If recovery is insufficient, uncoupled bone turnover can pose a significant risk to their bone health. While skeletal-immune system crosstalk has been studied, the interaction during and after exercise in athletes is an emerging area of research. Nutritional interventions have been investigated for their effects on bone metabolism surrounding exercise. However, limited research has examined dietary protein intake in endurance athletes, particularly concerning its effects on bone metabolism and osteoimmunology. This narrative review provides an overview of the evidence on the effects of endurance exercise and dietary protein intake on osteokines, bone turnover, and inflammatory markers in endurance athletes. Acute bouts of high-intensity running increase osteokines and bone turnover markers that promote bone resoprtion which parallels increases in pro-inflammatory markers in endurance athletes, suggesting crosstalk between these systems during and after exercise. Chronic endurance exercise promotes increased resting levels of bone formation, while reducing resting pro-inflammatory markers. Adequate dietary protein ingestion habitually and pre-, during, and post-exercise may attenuate bone resportion and pro-inflammatory markers in endurance athletes.",

    "abstract": "Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a metabolic regulator that may increase in circulation following exercise. This study was undertaken to determine if changes to FGF21 post-exercise are dependent on biological sex and exercise modality. Secondary analyses were conducted to determine if the post-exercise rise in FGF21 was associated with upstream signaling factors (glucagon, epinephrine, glucose) and excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC) response. Following a randomized crossover design, male and female participants completed two, thirty minute exercise protocols - during the steady state (SS) protocol, participants cycled at 70% of VO2peak and during the sprint interval exercise (IE) protocol participants completed six, thirty second \"all out\" sprints against 7.5% of body weight with four and half minutes of active recovery between sprints. Blood samples were taken at baseline, immediately post-exercise (IPE), and 1-hour post-exercise. Oxygen consumption was monitored continuously throughout the trials. In males, FGF21 levels were increased at 1-hour post-exercise with no difference between conditions; in females, FGF21 levels were unchanged as a result of exercise. Comparison of the post-exercise FGF21 incremental area under the curve revealed that in the SS condition males had a greater FGF21 response than females and that within males the SS condition had a greater response than the IE condition. Exercise significantly increased FGF21 levels in males, but not in females. In males, FGF21 levels were greater in the SS condition than in the IE condition.",

    "abstract": "This study used a systematic evaluation and meta-analysis to determine how the timing of nutritional supplements affected the recovery from post-exercise weariness. A vital component of enhancing athletic performance and advancing health is post-exercise recovery, where nutritional supplements are crucial. Although it has been demonstrated that supplementing timing may affect recovery outcomes, there is conflicting evidence about the best time to take supplements. We thoroughly searched several academic databases and screened for inclusion of randomized controlled trials, clinical trials, and observational studies that satisfied the criteria in order to examine the effects of varying nutritional supplementation timing (immediate vs. delayed supplementation) on fatigue recovery. The findings demonstrated that, in comparison to delayed supplementation, protein and carbohydrate supplementation right after exercise dramatically expedited muscle recovery, glycogen recovery, and decreased tiredness. Furthermore, the impact of supplementation timing on recovery effects differed depending on the individual and the type of exercise (e.g., strength training, endurance exercise, and high-intensity interval training). Recovery from post-exercise weariness is significantly impacted by the timing of nutritional intake. Supplementing with protein and carbohydrates right after exercise, particularly after intense exercise, can help with tiredness relief, muscle recovery, and glycogen replenishment.",

Athletes typically exhibit greater microbial diversity, which may be associated with improved performance, but the mechanisms linking different exercise modalities to the gut microbiome are not fully understood. In this study, blood and stool samples were collected from endurance athletes, strength athletes, and non-athletic controls performing two maximal exercise tests (the anaerobic Wingate test and the aerobic Bruce Treadmill Test) to integrate serum biomarker data with gut bacterial metagenomic profiles. While most biochemical markers showed similar post-exercise trends across groups, SPARC (secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine) and adiponectin levels showed modality-specific responses. Strength-trained participants showed unique microbiome-biomarker associations after the Wingate test. In addition, baseline enrichment of certain bacterial taxa, including Clostridium phoceensis and Catenibacterium spp., correlated with reduced Bruce Treadmill test response in strength-trained individuals. These findings, while requiring further validation, indicate the complex interplay between exercise type, training background, and the gut microbiome, and suggest that specific microbial species may help shape recovery and adaptation.",

    "abstract": "Exercise-induced fatigue and inflammation can significantly impair athletic performance and recovery. Effective strategies to mitigate these effects are critical for athletes and those engaged in high-intensity physical activities. Anti-inflammatory properties have been associated with Antarctic krill oil (AKO), which contains n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). After exhaustive exercise, this study examined how 4-week AKO supplementation affected skeletal muscle inflammation and the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathways in mice. Sixty male SPF-grade 8-week-old C57BL/6J mice were randomly assigned to four groups: soybean oil control (BO-C), AKO control (KO-C), soybean oil exercise (BO-E), and AKO exercise (KO-E). The KO groups received 200 mg/kg/BW AKO intragastrically for four weeks, while the BO groups received an equivalent volume of soybean oil. After the supplementation period, the exercise groups underwent a strenuous treadmill exercise. Grasping force was measured at 0 h, 6 h, 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h post-exercise, and tissue samples were analyzed histologically and biochemically. Results showed that AKO significantly reduced body weight and enhanced exercise endurance and recovery. Furthermore, serum CK, LDH and CRP levels, as well as muscle TNF-α concentrations, and TLR4 and MyD88 protein expressions were lower in the KO-E group than in the BO-E group. As a result of modulating the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway through AKO supplementation, it decreases inflammation after exhaustive exercise and promotes recovery.",

    "abstract": "Compression garments are a commonly used recovery aid following resistance exercise, which may improve muscle blood flow and perceived recovery. However, there has been limited insight into the underlying molecular mechanisms that may mediate the physiological effects of compression garments. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of compression tights on markers of muscle protein synthesis, muscle blood flow, and indices of recovery following a bout of resistance exercise. Twenty resistance-trained participants (5 females, 15 males) completed a leg-press exercise session followed by a 5-h recovery period wearing either commercially available compression tights (COMP, n = 10) or no tights (CON, n = 10). Physiological (markers of muscle protein synthesis, muscle blood flow, blood lactate, blood glucose), perceptual (total quality of recovery, perceived muscle soreness, and subjective well-being), and performance measures (countermovement jump and isometric mid-thigh pull) were collected at baseline, immediately post-exercise (performance and perceptual only), and at 1 h (physiological and perceptual only), 5 h, and 24 h post-exercise. No significant ( P < 0.05) interactions were observed between groups in physiological, performance, and perceptual measures. There were main effects of time for post-exercise measures compared with baseline ( P < 0.05), with increased markers of muscle protein synthesis, muscle blood flow, blood lactate, muscle soreness, and reduced blood glucose, total quality of recovery, subjective well-being, and countermovement jump height for both groups. Commercially available compression tights used post-resistance exercise did not influence muscle protein synthesis markers, muscle blood flow, or indices of exercise recovery following resistance exercise in the current study.",

    "abstract": "Post-exercise recovery strategies influence the body's ability to restore physiological homeostasis, replenish energy stores, repair muscle damage, and promote desired adaptations, which improve exercise performance. This narrative review examines the impact of nutritional strategies commonly used for enhancing recovery and subsequent exercise performance, particularly when athletes face short recovery periods. Carbohydrate ingestion is essential for glycogen replenishment, especially within the initial hours post-exercise, with its impact dependent on the types, timing, and amount. Protein is essential for accelerating muscle recovery and achieving a positive nitrogen balance, depending on the type and dosage. The co-ingestion of carbohydrates with proteins or fats is explored for its role in maximizing glycogen resynthesis and muscle repair, with evidence supporting the addition of protein to suboptimal carbohydrate intake for enhanced recovery. Moreover, this review addresses the potential benefits of creatine and caffeine co-ingestion for accelerating glycogen synthesis and improving subsequent performance. Hydration strategies, including the use of milk-based beverages and electrolyte solutions, are also discussed, emphasizing their importance in maintaining fluid balance and optimizing recovery. This review also highlights the emerging role of micronutrients such as omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidants, and sodium bicarbonate in reducing muscle damage and improving acid-base balance. Evidence supports the tailored use of these nutritional strategies, particularly for athletes managing tight competition/training schedules. Future research should focus on refining individualized approaches for recovery and investigating the impact of novel supplements on subsequent performance.",

    "abstract": "Intense physical activity in endurance horses triggers complex immune and inflammatory responses, yet the molecular mechanisms underlying these adaptations remain unclear. This study investigated immune-related transcriptomic changes following a 160 km endurance ride, focusing on sex-based differences. Using a bioinformatics approach, differentially expressed genes (DEGs), pathways, microRNAs (miRNAs), and transcription factors (TFs) were analyzed before (T0) and after (T1) the ride. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis was conducted to identify key regulatory genes. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed significant activation of immune-regulatory and ribosomal pathways. Notably, TLR4, CXCL8, and CCL5 were identified as key hub genes involved in immune modulation post-exercise. Comparisons between female (FT1 vs FT0) and gelding (GT1 vs GT0) horses revealed distinct molecular responses. Female horses exhibited upregulation of ribosomal protein genes, suggesting enhanced protein synthesis and muscle recovery. In contrast, geldings showed increased expression of inflammatory and stress-related genes, indicating a heightened immune response. Notably, sex-based differences were observed, with FT1 vs FT0 and GT1 vs GT0 comparisons revealing distinct KEGG pathway enrichments. Additionally, miRNA and TF analyses revealed regulatory elements influencing endurance-related immune responses. Our findings demonstrated sex-specific molecular mechanisms underlying endurance exercise adaptation, with females prioritizing protein synthesis and recovery, while geldings exhibit stronger inflammatory responses and stress-related pathways. This study provides critical insights into how sex influences exercise physiology at the transcriptomic level, with potential applications in training and recovery strategies for endurance horses.",

    "abstract": "Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is strongly associated with metabolic diseases. Both high-intensity interval training (HIT) and moderate-intensity training (MIT) reduce VAT effectively; however, HIT might mediate greater VAT loss in females. The estrogen receptor α (ERα) pathway may play a key role. The aim of the present study was to confirm the role of adipose/hypothalamic ERα in HIT/MIT-mediated VAT loss, as well as the associated hypothalamic electrophysiology and body catabolism changes in pre- and post-menopausal animal models. Ovariectomy (OVX) or sham surgeries were conducted to establish pre/postmenopausal female rat models. After distance-matched long-term HIT and MIT interventions, ERα expression in hypothalamic/VAT, as well as food intake, spontaneous physical activity (SPA), VAT mass and morphology, local field potential (LFPs) in paraventricular nuclei (PVN) and excessive post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC), were observed. A target chemical block during the post-exercise recovery period was executed to further verify the role of the hypothalamic ERα pathway. HIT enhanced the expression of ERα in the hypothalamus rather than VAT in the pre-, but not the postmenopausal group, which was accompanied by elevated LFP power density in α and β bands, enhanced EPOC and larger VAT loss than MIT. Chemical blockade of ERα suppressed EPOC and VAT catabolism mediated by HIT. During the post-exercise recovery period, the hypothalamic ERα pathway involved in HIT induced EPOC elevation and VAT reduction in premenopausal female rats.",

This study aimed to evaluate the impact of PBMT on the dynamics of monocyte subpopulations and cytokine levels after a plyometric exercise session in physically active men aged 18-25 years. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 22 participants were divided into PBMT and placebo groups. Blood samples were collected before, immediately after, and 72 h post-exercise. Monocyte subpopulations were analyzed by flow cytometry, while cytokine levels (TNF-α and MCP-1) were quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorvent assays (ELISA). Plyometric exercise increases classic monocytes (CD14 + CD16-) at 72 h compared in the PBMT group (+ 2,38% p = 0.035). Intermediate monocytes (CD14 + CD16 +), increase immediately after (p < 0.001) and 72 h (PTBM + 21,43%; placebo + 36%; p = 0.023) after exercise in the both group; Non-classical monocytes (CD14-CD16 +) showed differences between groups at 72 h (11,11%; p = 0.002). Exercise increased TNF-α and MCP-1 levels immediately after (p < 0.01 for both groups). PBMT reduced TNF-α levels below baseline at 72 h (-12,50%; p = 0.035), while MCP-1 remained elevated in the placebo group (+ 27,78%; p < 0.035). Differences in MCP-1 changes (Δ%) were observed 72 h post-exercise (p = 0.03). These findings suggest that PBMT attenuates inflammation and promotes immune recovery after exercise.",

    "title": "The interactions between monocarboxylate transporter genes MCT1, MCT2, and MCT4 and the kinetics of blood lactate production and removal after high-intensity efforts in elite males: a cross-sectional study.",
    "abstract": "This cross-sectional study investigated the relationship between genetic variations in monocarboxylate transporter genes and blood lactate production and removal after high-intensity efforts in humans. The study was conducted to explore how genetic variations in the MCT1, MCT2, and MCT4 genes influenced lactate dynamics and to advance the field of sports genetics by pinpointing critical genetic markers that can enhance athletic performance and recovery. 337 male athletes from Poland and the Czech Republic underwent two intermittent all-out Wingate tests. Before the tests, DNA samples were taken from each participant, and SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) analysis was carried out. Two intermittent all-out tests were implemented, and lactate concentrations were assessed before and after these tests. Sprinters more frequently exhibited the haplotype TAC in the MCT2 gene, which was associated with an increase in the difference between maximum lactate and final lactate concentration. Additionally, this haplotype was linked to higher maximum lactate concentration and was more frequently observed in sprinters. The genotypic interactions AG/T- and GGxT- (MCT1 rs3789592 x MCT4 rs11323780), TTxTT (MCT1 rs12028967 x MCT2 rs3763979), and MCT1 rs7556664 x MCT4 rs11323780 were all associated with an increase in the difference between maximum lactate concentration and final lactate concentration. Conversely, the AGxGG (MCT1 rs3789592 x MCT2 rs995343) interaction was linked to a decrease in this difference. The relationship between maximum lactate concentration and genotypic interactions can be observed as follows: when ATxTT (MCT2 rs3763980 x MCT4 rs11323780) or CTxCT (MCT1 rs10857983 x MCT2 rs3763979) genotypic combinations are present, it leads to a decrease in maximum lactate concentration. Similarly, the combination of CTxCT (MCT1 rs4301628 x MCT2 rs3763979), CT x TT (MCT1 rs4301628 x MCT4 rs11323780), and CTxTT (MCT1 rs4301628 x MCT2 rs3763979) results in decreased maximum lactate concentration. The TAC haplotype (rs3763980, rs995343, rs3763979) in the MCT2 gene is associated with altered lactate clearance in sprinters, potentially affecting performance and recovery by elevating post-exercise lactate concentrations. While MCT4 rs11323780 is also identified as a significant variant in lactate metabolism, suggesting its role as a biomarker for sprinting performance, further investigation is necessary to clarify underlying mechanisms and consider additional factors. Based on elite male athletes from Poland and the Czech Republic, the study may not generalize to all sprinters or diverse athletic populations. Although genetic variants show promise as biomarkers for sprinting success, athletic performance is influenced by a complex interplay of genetics, environment, and training extending beyond MCT genes.",

    "abstract": "Curcumin is known for its potential health benefits; however, the evidence remains inconclusive regarding its necessity as a supplement for athletes during the preparatory phase of training. This study aimed to assess the effect of 6-week curcumin supplementation at a dose of 2g/day on selected inflammatory markers, blood count, and brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) levels in middle-aged amateur long-distance runners during the preparatory period of a macrocycle. Thirty runners were randomly assigned to either a curcumin-supplemented group (CUR, n = 15) or a placebo group (PLA, n = 15). Venous blood samples were collected at rest, immediately post-exercise, and 1h post-exercise. The participants underwent a graded exercise stress test, with an increasing inclination angle after reaching a speed of 14 km/h, both before and after the 6-week supplementation period. Blood samples were collected at rest, 3 minutes post-stress test, and after 1 hour of recovery. The results showed no significant changes in C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukin-1 β (IL-1β), or blood morphology due to curcumin supplementation. However, BDNF levels increased by 21% in the CUR group post-supplementation, while a 5% decrease was observed in the PLA group. These findings do not support a significant effect of curcumin supplementation on inflammatory markers, blood count, or BDNF concentration. Further research is warranted to determine the potential benefits of curcumin supplementation for endurance athletes during the preparatory period for a training cycle.",

The temporal profile of thiol-oxidized albumin, a marker of oxidative stress, has shown potential in assessing recovery from EIMD in non-athletically trained participants but not yet in trained participants. Our primary aim was to assess whether there are changes in the level of thiol-oxidized albumin after a marathon in athletically trained participants. Twenty participants completed a marathon and collected daily dried blood spots from 3 days prior to and 7 days after the marathon to measure thiol-oxidized albumin using a novel methodology (OxiDx). Participants were also assessed for indirect markers of EIMD prior to and on days 2 and 5 post-marathon. The level of thiol-oxidized albumin peaked at 2 days and remained elevated until 5 days after the marathon and correlated with indirect measures of EIMD. Furthermore, time of recovery for thiol-oxidized albumin varied between participants, some recovered at 3 days post-marathon whereas others extended beyond 7 days post marathon. Tracking temporal changes in the level of thiol-oxidized albumin has potential to be useful in managing recovery from EIMD in athletes, particularly considering the ease of the OxiDx methodology.",

    "title": "High-intensity interval training or lactate administration combined with aerobic training enhances visceral fat loss while promoting VMH neuroplasticity in female rats.",
    "abstract": "High-intensity interval training (HIT) does not burn fat during exercise. However, it significantly reduces visceral adipose after long-term training. The underlying mechanism may be related to the elevation of fat consumption during the post-exercise recovery period, which is regulated by the hypothalamus-adipose axis. Lactate is a hallmark metabolite of high-intensity exercise, which could mediate significant neuroplasticity through the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) pathway. However, whether HIT could enhance hypothalamus activity and adipose catabolism in the recovery period remains to be elucidated. Also, it is worth exploring whether adding lactate administration to prolonged, continuous submaximal aerobic training (AT) could simulate HIT-induced neuroplastic effects and fat loss. First, we compared the influence of 4-week HIT and aerobic training (AT) on the electrophysiology of the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), which is deeply involved in the regulation of lipolysis, as well as the 24-hour excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC), the fat oxidation rate and lipolysis. To further confirm whether excess lactate during AT could reproduce the effect of HIT, we also observed the effects of lactate infusion during AT (AT + Lac) on neuroplasticity and metabolism. Four-week HIT induced higher BDNF expression and a higher neuronal spike firing rate in VMH than AT, accompanied by elevated EPOC, fat oxidation and visceral fat lipolysis. AT + Lac and HITT could induce similar hypothalamic and metabolic changes. However, power spectral density analysis of local field potentials (LFPs) showed that the AT + Lac group was affected in fewer frequency bands than the HIT group. HIT-induced reduction of visceral fat was accompanied by increased VMH activity. Adding lactate administration to AT could partially reproduce hypothalamic plasticity and the metabolic effects of HIT. However, different band changes of LFPs implied that the neuronal subpopulations or pathways influenced by these two methods were not entirely consistent.",

This review explores the evolving trend from traditional supplements, such as protein, carbohydrates, creatine, and branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), toward functional foods rich in bioactive compounds. Evidence highlights the benefits of functional foods like tart cherry juice (anthocyanins), turmeric-seasoned foods, and sources of omega-3 fatty acids, including fish, flaxseeds, chia seeds, and walnuts, for mitigating oxidative stress and inflammation. Additionally, probiotics and prebiotics support gut health and immune function, which are integral to effective recovery.

A systematic search across PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar (2000-2024) identified studies with high empirical rigor and relevance to recovery outcomes. Findings underscore the need for further research into nutrient interactions, dosage optimization, and long-term effects on athletic performance.

Eighteen healthy adult women were randomly assigned to a CWI group and a control group (CG) (n = 9/group). Participants performed 10 sets of 10 repetitions of isokinetic EC at 30°/second and underwent maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVC), delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) assessment, straight leg raise (SLR) test, and plasma myoglobin (Mb) measurement. The CWI group received one 14-min session of CWI treatment (14°C) at 1, 25, 49, 73, and 97 h after the EC test, whereas the CG rested in a seated position at the same five time points without receiving treatment. (1) All the dependent variables in the CWI group and CG exhibited significant changes after the EC test (p < 0.05). (2) The recovery effect in the CWI group was significantly greater than in the CG in terms of the MVC, DOMS, SLR, and plasma Mb concentration results. MVC increased by 89.3 ± 2.0% on the fourth day (p < 0.013), DOMS decreased by 15.4 ± 1.5 mm on the second day (p < 0.000), SLR increased by 86.3 ± 1.1% on the second day (p < 0.014), and plasma Mb decreased by 436.3 ± 60.8% on the third day (p < 0.014).

That is, acute (<24 h) stable isotope-derived measures of muscle protein synthesis have led to established recommendations for protein quantity, quality, source, and timing of protein ingestion to support muscle health at rest, post exercise, and to overcome age-related anabolic resistance in older adults. Although muscle health is undoubtedly important, moving from muscle to other associated or disease-specific outcomes is a critical next step for the field, given the mounting evidence documenting the effects of dietary protein on measures of chronic disease and age-related decline (for example, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, frailty, and osteoporosis). In this narrative review, we posit that future studies evaluating the potential role of dietary protein build off of the existing knowledge base generated from decades of past research and focus their efforts on closing unanswered knowledge gaps pertaining to dietary protein and health across the lifespan. Throughout this review, we highlight potential methodologies and novel outcome measures that researchers may consider as starting points to facilitate the next 30 y of advances in the field of dietary protein and health.",

A literature search was conducted using the PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases, yielding 945 articles published up to 31 October 2024. Of these, 112 peer-reviewed articles met the inclusion criteria and formed the basis of this review. AKG supports muscle recovery by stimulating muscle satellite cells (MuSCs) and macrophage polarization, aiding muscle repair and reducing fibrosis. Additionally, AKG shows promise in preventing muscle atrophy by enhancing protein synthesis, inhibiting degradation pathways, and modulating inflammatory responses, making it relevant in conditions like sarcopenia, cachexia, and injury recovery. For athletes and active individuals, AKG supplementation has enhanced endurance, reduced fatigue, and supported faster post-exercise recovery. Despite promising preliminary findings, research gaps remain in understanding AKG's long-term effects, optimal dosage, and specific pathways, particularly across diverse populations. Further research, including large-scale clinical trials, is essential to clarify AKG's role in muscle health and to optimize its application as a therapeutic agent for skeletal muscle diseases and an enhancer of physical performance. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of AKG's benefits and identify future directions for research in both clinical and sports settings.",

Hot-water immersion (HWI), a widely used post-exercise recovery strategy, activates the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, a key regulator of ribosome biogenesis in skeletal muscle. However, the effect of HWI on skeletal muscle ribosome biogenesis is not well understood. Here, we aimed to investigate the effects of HWI and post-exercise HWI on ribosome biogenesis using a rat RE model. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to HWI and non-HWI groups. In both groups, the right leg was isometrically exercised using transcutaneous electrical stimulation, while the left leg was used as an internal non-RE control. Following RE, both limbs were immersed in hot water (41.2 ± 0.03°C) for 20 min under isoflurane anesthesia in the HWI group and the gastrocnemius muscles were sampled at 3- and 24-h post-exercise.

EPOC is linearly related to exercise duration and exponentially related to exercise intensity. It is commonly believed that near-maximal intensity interval training prompts the body to produce greater EPOC. This review focuses on the origin and development of high-intensity interval training (HIIT), analyzes its concept, classification and function, and discusses its effects on human EPOC. HIIT promotes a significant increase in EPOC during the fast recovery period, whereas the changes of EPOC during the slow recovery period are still inconclusive; Sprint interval training (SIT) promotes a significant increase in EPOC throughout the whole recovery period.

    "title": "Responses to Exercise with Low Carbohydrate Availability on Muscle Glycogen and Cell Signaling: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.",
    "abstract": "The growing interest in how exercise and carbohydrate (CHO) restriction may modify molecular responses that promote endurance adaptations has led to many interesting controversies. We conducted a systematic review and a meta-analysis regarding the effect of low-carbohydrate availability (LOW) pre-, during, or post-exercise, on the mRNA content of commonly measured genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis (PGC-1α, TFAM mRNA) and metabolism (PDK4, UCP3 and GLUT4 mRNA), and on muscle glycogen levels, compared with a high-CHO (CON) condition. MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were searched following the PRISMA 2020 guidelines (with an end date of November 2023). In total, 19 randomized-controlled studies were considered for inclusion. We evaluated the methodological quality of all studies using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for randomized clinical studies. A meta-analysis was performed using a random effects model to calculate the standardized mean difference (SMD), estimated by Hedges' g, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The LOW condition was associated with an increased mRNA content of several genes during the early recovery period post-exercise, such as PDK4 (SMD 1.61; 95% CI 0.80-2.42), GLUT4 (SMD 1.38; 95% CI 0.46-2.30), and UCP3 (SMD 2.05; 95% CI 0.40-3.69). However, overall, there was no significant effect on the mRNA content of PGC-1α or TFAM. Finally, CHO restriction and exercise significantly reduced muscle glycogen levels (SMD 3.69; 95% CI 2.82-5.09). A meta-analysis of subgroups from studies with a difference in muscle glycogen concentration of > 200 mmol kg dw The meta-analysis results show that CHO restriction was associated with an increase in the exercise-induced mRNA content of PDK4, UCP3, and GLUT4, but not the exercise-induced mRNA content of PGC-1ɑ and TFAM. However, when there were substantial differences in glycogen depletion between CON and LOW CHO conditions (> 200 mmol kg dw",

    "abstract": "Managing metabolism for optimal training, performance, and recovery in medium-to-high-level endurance runners involves enhancing energy systems through strategic nutrient intake. Optimal carbohydrate intake before, during, and after endurance running can enhance glycogen stores and maintain optimal blood glucose levels, influencing various physiological responses and adaptations, including transitory post-endurance inflammation. This randomized trial investigates the impact of a high-dose 2:1 maltodextrin-fructose supplementation to medium-to-high-level endurance runners immediately before, during, and after a 15 km run at 90% VO We evaluated inflammatory biomarkers and lipidomic profiles before the endurance tests and up to 24 h after. We focused on the effects of high-dose 2:1 maltodextrin-fructose supplementation on white blood cell count, neutrophil number, IL-6, cortisol, and CRP levels, as well as polyunsaturated fatty acids, ω-3 index, and AA/EPA ratio. This supplementation significantly reduced inflammatory markers and metabolic stress. Additionally, it may enhance the post-activity increase in blood ω-3 fatty acid levels and reduce the increase in ω-6 levels, resulting in a lower trend of AA/EPA ratio at 24 h in the treated arm. Adequate carbohydrate supplementation may acutely mitigate inflammation during a one-hour endurance activity of moderate-to-high intensity. These effects could be beneficial for athletes engaging in frequent, high-intensity activities.",

At 4 and 16 h post-exercise, glycogen degradation was associated with decreased STBD1 (glycophagy tagging protein) and increased GABARAPL1 (Atg8 protein), suggesting that glycophagy activity was increased.

However, it is important to verify the effect of lactate supplementation alone and the timing of glycogen recovery. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to examine the effect of lactate supplementation immediately after exercise on glycogen recovery in mice liver and skeletal muscle at 1, 3, and 5 h after exercise. Mice were randomly divided into the sedentary, exercise-only, lactate, and saline-treated groups. mRNA expression and activation of glycogen synthesis and lactate transport-related factors in the liver and skeletal muscle were assessed using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Skeletal muscle glycogen concentration showed an increasing trend in the lactate group compared with that in the control group at 3 and 5 h after post-supplementation. Additionally, exogenous lactate supplementation significantly increased the expression of core glycogen synthesis enzymes, lactate transporters, and pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 alpha 1 in the skeletal muscles. Conversely, glycogen synthesis, lactate transport, and glycogen oxidation to acetyl-CoA were not significantly affected in the liver by exogenous lactate supplementation. Overall, these results suggest that post-exercise lactate supplement enables glycogen synthesis and recovery in skeletal muscles.",

Resistance-trained young (n=8; 22±2 years) and master (n=8; 52±4 years) male athletes of a similar performance level performed a standardized high-intensity eccentric squat exercise protocol (10 sets of half-squats at 70% of 1-repetition maximum). The serum concentration of 20 biomarkers related to tissue damage, inflammation, remodeling, and repair was measured at baseline, immediately after exercise, and over a 72 h recovery period. Both groups experienced similar muscle damage as evidenced by a comparable increase in creatine kinase activity 24 h after exercise (p<0.001). Interleukin-6 (p=0.009) and growth hormone (p<0.001) increased immediately post-exercise in both groups. Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 increased immediately post-exercise only in young athletes (p=0.003) and then decreased 24 h later. There were no significant differences for the remaining variables, including cell markers related to neutrophil/macrophage activation or pro/anti-inflammatory cytokines.

    "abstract": "A comprehensive recent study by Trommelen et al. demonstrated that muscle tissue exhibits a greater capacity to incorporate exogenous exogenous protein-derived amino acids into bound muscle protein than was previously appreciated, at least when measured in \"anabolically sensitive,\" recreationally active (but not resistance-trained), young men following resistance exercise. Moreover, this study demonstrated that the duration of the postprandial period is modulated by the dose of ingested protein contained within a meal, that is, the postexercise muscle protein synthesis response to protein ingestion was more prolonged in 100PRO than 25PRO. Both observations represent important scientific advances in the field of protein metabolism. However, we respectfully caution that the practical implications of these findings may have been misinterpreted, at least in terms of dismissing the concept of protein meal distribution as an important factor in optimizing muscle tissue anabolism and/or metabolic health. Moreover, based on emerging evidence, this idea that the anabolic response to protein ingestion has no upper limit does not appear to translate to resistance-trained young women.",

    "abstract": "Lower oxidative capacity in skeletal muscles (SKMs) is a prevailing cause of metabolic diseases. Exercise not only enhances the fatty acid oxidation (FAO) capacity of SKMs but also increases lactate levels. Given that lactate may contribute to tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) flux and impact monocarboxylate transporter 1 in the SKMs, we hypothesize that lactate can influence glucose and fatty acid (FA) metabolism. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the mechanism underlying lactate-driven FAO regulation in the SKM of mice with diet-induced obesity (DIO). Lactate was administered to DIO mice immediately after exercise for over 3 wk. We found that increased lactate levels enhanced energy expenditure mediated by fat metabolism during exercise recovery and decreased triglyceride levels in DIO mice SKMs. To determine the lactate-specific effects without exercise, we administered lactate to mice on a high-fat diet (HFD) for 8 wk. Similar to our exercise conditions, lactate increased FAO, TCA cycle activity, and mitochondrial respiration in the SKMs of HFD-fed mice. In addition, under sufficient FA conditions, lactate increased uncoupling protein-3 abundance via the NADH-NAD",

    "abstract": "Post-exercise hot (HWI) and cold (CWI) water immersion are popular strategies used by athletes in a range of sporting contexts, such as enhancing recovery or adaptation. However, prolonged heating bouts increase neuroendocrine responses that are associated with perceptions of fatigue. Fourteen endurance-trained runners performed three trials consisting of two 45-min runs at 95% lactate threshold on a treadmill separated by 6 h of recovery. Following the first run, participants completed one of HWI (30 min, 40°C), CWI (15 min, 14°C) or control (CON, 30 min rest in ambient conditions) in a randomised order. Perceived effort and recovery were measured using ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) and the Acute Recovery and Stress Scale (ARSS), whilst physiological responses including venous concentrations of a range of neuroendocrine markers, superficial femoral blood flow, heart rate and rectal temperature were measured. Exercise increased neuroendocrine responses of interleukin-6, adrenaline and noradrenaline (all P < 0.001). Additionally, perceptions of overall recovery (P < 0.001), mental performance capacity (P = 0.02), physical performance capability (P = 0.01) and emotional balance (P = 0.03) were reduced prior to the second run. However, there was no effect of condition on these variables (P > 0.05), nor RPE (P = 0.68), despite differences in rectal temperature, superficial femoral blood flow following the first run, and participants' expected recovery prior to the intervention (all P < 0.001). Therefore, athletes may engage in post-exercise hot or cold-water immersion without negatively impacting moderate-intensity training sessions performed later the same day.",

    "abstract": "Eight geldings weighing 544 ± 16 kg were used to evaluate feeding a postexercise protein meal on plasma amino acids during recovery. Horses were fed sweet feed, corn, grass hay and equal amounts of a protein pellet (32% CP) with meals (MP group) or postexercise (EP group). Horses exercised 1-2 h/day, 5 days/week, for 12 weeks. A pre and poststudy 4 days total urine and feces collection was conducted. Urine and fecal samples were analyzed for nitrogen (N) to calculate N balance. Blood samples were drawn immediately after and at 1 and 3 h postexercise at the start and end of the study for plasma amino acid concentrations. Absorbed N and N retention were greater for the MP group compared to the EP group (p = 0.038, 0.033 respectively). An interaction revealed an increase in fecal N (p = 0.01) and decreased N digestibility for the MP group compared to the EP group at the end of the study. Plasma concentrations for 8 out of 14 amino acids were less for the EP group immediately after exercise compared to the MP group (p < 0.02). Plasma concentrations of lysine and arginine were greater for the EP group compared to the MP group at 1 and 3 h after exercise (p < 0.05 and 0.04 respectively). Changes were different for 8 out of the 14 amino acids immediately post exercise, 7 out of 14 amino acids at 1 h postexercise and 10 out of 14 amino acids at 3 h postexercise with positive changes for the EP group and negative changes for the MP group. The EP group had improved supply of plasma amino acids in the recovery period that sustained for 3 h postexercise and are indicative of better amino acid supply supporting muscle development.",

    "abstract": "Cryostimulation involves using water environments and low temperatures as intervention mediums, with main methods including CWI (cold water immersion), CWT (contrast water therapy), and WBC (whole-body cryostimulation). Previous systematic reviews focused on the effect of cryostimulation on muscle fatigue and sports performance. However, studies on the selection of different cryostimulation methods and their intervention effects present inconsistent results. To systematically review and methodologically appraise the quality and effectiveness of existing intervention studies that the effects of various cryostimulation methods, including CWI, CWT, and WBC, on exercise performance and fatigue recovery. Following PRISMA guidelines, we conducted searches in PubMed, Embase, The Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and EBSCO databases to gather randomized controlled trials or self-controlled trials involving CWI/CWT/WBC and their effects on exercise performance or fatigue recovery. The search period ranged from November 2013 to November 2, 2023. Literature screening was performed using EndNote X9.1, and the quality of included studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool. Meta-analysis was conducted using RevMan 5.3 software. This study included a total of 18 articles, included a total of 499 healthy participants, comprising 479 males and 20 females. Among them, participants underwent cryostimulation, including 102 using CWT, using CWI, and 58 using WBC. Compared to the control group, cryostimulation can significantly alleviate muscle pain intensity (SMD -0.45, 95% CL -0.82 to 0.09, P = 0.01). Specifically, CWI significantly reduced muscle pain intensity (SMD = -0.45, 95% CI: 0.820.09, P = 0.01), WBC significantly decreased C-reactive protein levels (SMD = -1.36, 95% CI: 2.350.36, P = 0.008). While, CWT showed no significant differences from the control group in exercise performance and fatigue recovery indicators (P > 0.05). Cryostimulation can significantly reduce muscle pain intensity and perceived fatigue. Specifically, CWI significantly alleviates muscle pain intensity, WBC significantly lowers markers of inflammation caused by fatigue after exercise, in contrast, CWT does not significantly improve exercise performance and fatigue recovery. After exercise, compared with rest, using cryostimulation may have more noticeable benefits for muscle fatigue and muscle pain, with recommendations prioritizing WBC and CWI particularly for addressing inflammation and muscle pain. However, all cryostimulation may have no significant influence on exercise performance.",

    "abstract": "It is a common belief amongst strength and power athletes that nutritional supplementation strategies aid recovery by shifting the anabolic/catabolic profile toward anabolism. Factors such as nutrient quantity, nutrient quality, and nutrient timing significantly impact upon the effectiveness of nutritional strategies in optimizing the acute responses to resistance exercise and the adaptive response to resistance training (i.e., muscle growth and strength expression). Specifically, the aim of this review is to address carbohydrates (CHOs), protein (PRO), and/or amino acids (AAs) supplementation strategies, as there is growing evidence suggesting a link between nutrient signaling and the initiation of protein synthesis, muscle glycogen resynthesis, and the attenuation of myofibrillar protein degradation following resistance exercise. Collectively, the current scientific literature indicates that nutritional supplementation strategies utilizing CHO, PRO, and/or AA represents an important approach aimed at enhancing muscular responses for strength and power athletes, primarily increased muscular hypertrophy and enhanced strength expression. There appears to be a critical interaction between resistance exercise and nutrient-cell signaling associated with the principle of nutrient timing (i.e., pre-exercise, during, and post-exercise). Recommendations for nutritional supplementation strategies to promote muscular responses for strength and athletes are provided.",

    "abstract": "In chronic heart failure (HF), exercise-induced increase in pulmonary capillary pressure may cause an increase of pulmonary congestion, or the development of pulmonary oedema. We sought to assess in HF patients the exercise-induced intra-thoracic fluid movements, by measuring plasma brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), lung comets and lung diffusion for carbon monoxide (DLCO) and nitric oxide (DLNO), as markers of hemodynamic load changes, interstitial space and alveolar-capillary membrane fluids, respectively. Twenty-four reduced ejection fraction HF patients underwent BNP, lung comets and DLCO/DLNO measurements before, at peak and 1 h after the end of a maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test. BNP significantly increased at peak from 549 (328-841) to 691 (382-1207, p < 0.0001) pg/mL and almost completely returned to baseline value 1 h after exercise. Comets number increased at peak from 9.4 ± 8.2 to 24.3 ± 16.7, returning to baseline (9.7 ± 7.4) after 1 h (p < 0.0001). DLCO did not change significantly at peak (from 18.01 ± 4.72 to 18.22 ± 4.73 mL/min/mmHg), but was significantly reduced at 1 h (16.97 ± 4.26 mL/min/mmHg) compared to both baseline (p = 0.0211) and peak (p = 0.0174). DLNO showed a not significant trend toward lower values 1 h post-exercise. Moderate/severe HF patients have a 2-step intra-thoracic fluid movement with exercise: the first during active exercise, from the vascular space toward the interstitial space, as confirmed by comets increase, without any effect on diffusion, and the second, during recovery, toward the alveolar-capillary membrane, clearing the interstitial space but worsening gas diffusion.",

    "abstract": "The organization of optimal nutrition, including the use of specialized foodstuffs (SF) and dietary supplements, is an integral part of the medical support system for sports reserve training in the Russian Federation. The purpose of the research was to evaluate the existing market of SF intended for child athletes, analyze regulatory documents and promising components for the development of new SF formulations for young athletes, taking into account the special needs associated with growth, development and specifics of sports activities. Material and methods. The literature search was performed for the period 2000-2025 using the databases of RSCI, PubMed, ResearchGate, Google Scholar, by keywords: «specialized foodstuffs», «child athletes», «adolescent athletes», «nutrition», «food supplements», «sports nutrition market». Results. The global market for «sports nutrition» in 2024 amounted to 21.71 billion US dollars, and by 2032 growth is projected to more than double. At the same time, abroad there is no separate niche for SF intended for child athletes. In the Russian Federation, single SF and dietary supplements for children aged 11 and 14 have been developed, passed the state registration procedure and entered into the «FMBA Form» for athletes of the Olympic reserve. Due to the lack of a regulatory framework for nutritional supplements for child athletes in the Russian Federation, the requirements of the Technical Regulations of the Customs Union (EAEU) and the Unified Sanitary, Epidemiological, and Hygienic Requirements for Products (Goods) Subject to Sanitary and Epidemiological Supervision (Control), applicable to SF for baby food, should be taken into account when developing formulas. In the Russian Federation, in addition to the requirements for essential macronutrients, vitamins, minerals and trace elements, adequate levels of daily intake have been determined for several minor bioactive compounds (BAC) for children aged 7-18 years: carnitine, choline, myo-inositol, flavonoids. This allows these BAS to be introduced into SF for young athletes without additional clinical studies. The main promising components for use in SF formulations for child athletes are various types of protein, carbohydrates, as well as vitamins, minerals and trace elements, minor BAC, for release in various forms: instant drinks and ready-to-drink, bars, cookies, jelly, encapsulated and tablet dietary supplements, etc. Conclusion. Nutrition for youth athletes must address not only the needs of athletes during sports activities but also support growth and development, meeting specific, higher quality and safety requirements. The SF market for child sports nutrition is represented by single products, which determines the broad prospects for the development and release of new products for the medical and biological support in youth sports.",

    "title": "Mobility and strength training with and without protein supplements for pre-frail/frail older people with low protein intake: maximising mobility and strength training (MMoST) feasibility randomised controlled trial.",
    "abstract": "The first objective was to establish the feasibility of conducting a definitive trial to evaluate the effectiveness of mobility and strength training with or without protein supplements for pre-frail/frail older people with low protein intake. The second objective was to finalise outcome measures for a definitive trial. Multicentre feasibility randomised controlled trial. Four National Health Service (NHS) community trust physiotherapy departments. We recruited via clinical caseloads, an existing cohort study and community advertising. Participants were adults aged ≥60 years, frail or pre-frail, reporting walking difficulties or slow walking and low protein intake (<1 g protein/kg of body weight (kgBW)/day). The recruitment target was 50 participants. All participants undertook two times a week mobility and strength training supported by a physiotherapist for 24 weeks. Half of the participants were randomised (1:1) to receive 24 weeks of daily protein supplements to increase protein intake up to 1.6 g/kgBW/day. Feasibility outcomes assessed recruitment, intervention fidelity, adherence, tolerance and study retention. We assessed clinical data collection at baseline and 5-8 month follow-up including the short physical performance battery (SPPB), 6 min walk test (6MWT) and participant-reported outcomes. Outcome assessors were blinded. All participants were analysed in the groups as randomised provided they were not withdrawn from the study before their treatment started and contributed outcome data (modified intention to treat). Our primary feasibility and secondary outcome measures were summarised using descriptive statistics such as mean and SD, median and IQR or counts with percentages. Secondary objectives were exploratory, and mean between group differences at follow-up were estimated for each continuous outcome using linear regression models adjusted for baseline outcome score and frailty status, and presented with associated 95% CIs. Initially, recruitment focused on existing caseloads, but patients were more unwell and disabled than anticipated and ineligible. No participants were recruited from the cohort. A community recruitment strategy was implemented. We screened 952 older adults and 20 participants were randomised. We ran out of time to reach our target.We achieved good intervention fidelity for both interventions. The median number of exercise sessions completed was 10.5/16 (IQR 7-13). Six participants received supplements which they tolerated well and took regularly. 14 participants (70%) attended follow-up assessments with no difference in retention between arms.The median age of participants was 76 years (IQR 68.5-80.0) and 15/20 (75%) were frail. All clinical outcomes showed a trend towards larger improvements in the exercise and protein arm, but these were not statistically significant. For example, SPPB scores (mean difference 0.93, 95% CI (-2.70 to 4.56)) and 6MWT (mean difference 41.92 m, 95% CI (-39.05 to 122.89)) were both higher in the exercise and protein arm compared to control. The study was not feasible based on the original protocol. Recruitment was the biggest challenge. We established a more efficient route to recruitment (community advertising) which requires further refinement. Clinical outcomes consistently favoured the exercise and protein group, which should be interpreted cautiously but suggest this question is worthy of further investigation. ISRCTN30405954.",

    "title": "Nutritional Strategies for Olympic Biathletes: A Practical Review.",
    "abstract": "Biathlon is a winter Olympic sport that combines high-intensity cross-country skiing with precise rifle shooting. These dual demands require athletes to develop exceptional aerobic capacity while maintaining fine motor accuracy under physiological stress. Despite its complexity, nutritional strategies in biathlon remain under-explored and recommendations are often extrapolated from related endurance sports. This narrative review aims to summarise existing knowledge on nutrition in biathlon, highlight sport-specific challenges and identify areas for future research. The main findings indicate that biathletes face very high energy demands, with daily expenditure exceeding 7000 kcal during intensive training. Carbohydrates are the primary fuel source, with intake recommendations based on training intensity and duration (6-12 g/kg/d). Furthermore, protein is essential for muscle repair, recovery and adaptation. To achieve the recommended intake of 1.6 g/kg/day, it is advisable to consume meals containing approximately 0.3 g/kg of high-quality protein every three to four hours. Given the frequency of training sessions, effective recovery strategies are important in biathlon. When recovery is a priority, biathletes should consume a meal comprising protein (approximately 0.3 g/kg) and carbohydrates (approximately 1.2 g/kg) before key training sessions. Micronutrient and vitamin deficiencies are not commonly observed in biathletes due to their high calorie intake. However, concerns regarding iron and vitamin D are common among endurance athletes due to the high risk of low energy intake, diets lacking in iron, and insufficient exposure to sunlight. On the day of the race, it is recommended that biathletes plan their meals to ensure that they meet their nutritional needs and begin recovery as soon as possible after the race is over. Biathletes may use specific supplements to enhance performance and health during preparation and competition. However, it is important to note that some supplements that improve performance may harm shooting accuracy. Current guidance is provisional, and future research should adopt a dual-performance framework that evaluates both endurance output and shooting precision under realistic competition conditions.",

    "title": "Reference Values for Macronutrients in Human Milk: the Mothers, Infants and Lactation Quality (MILQ) Study.",
    "abstract": "This second article in the series establishing reference values (RVs) for nutrients in human milk describes RVs for protein, carbohydrate, fat, and energy. To establish RVs, the mothers, infants, and lactation quality (MILQ) and early-MILQ studies collected human milk samples throughout the first 8.5 mo of lactation in 1242 well-nourished women in Bangladesh, Brazil, Denmark, and The Gambia. Macronutrients were measured by near-infrared spectroscopy. Protein concentrations decreased from 12.4 g/L at 4-17 d to a 7.7-7.9 g/L plateau by 4-5 mo. Carbohydrate concentrations were stable throughout lactation, ranging from 68.2 to 70.1 g/L. Fat concentrations decreased from 37.0 g/L at 4-17 d to 31.2-32.8 g/L after 2-3 mo. Energy density mirrored fat trends, decreasing from 665 kcal/L at 4-17 d to 597-602 kcal/L by 3-4 mo. Compared with estimates used by the Institute of Medicine (IOM)--renamed the National Academy of Medicine (NAM) in 2015--to set nutrient intake recommendations for infants, MILQ values were ∼90% of concentrations used for carbohydrate and energy, and 70%-80% for protein and fat. Total daily median intakes (concentrations × milk volumes) from 1 to 6 mo were on par with IOM adequate intakes (AIs) for carbohydrate and energy, 65% of the AI for protein, and 84% of the AI for fat. These RVs offer a critical resource for understanding the nutritional contributions of human milk and informing public health practices to support infant growth and development.",

    "title": "Highly Variable Hemoglobin-Mass Changes During Successive Altitude Training Camps in World-Class Female Water Polo Players.",
    "abstract": "The effects of repeated \"live high-train high\" training camps on total hemoglobin mass (tHBmass) in female team-sport athletes have not been investigated. To assess whether the changes in tHBmass were repeatable in 16 world-class female water polo players during successive live high-train high camps at 2320 m, separated by 24 weeks, in preparation of international championships. tHBmass was measured by optimized carbon monoxide rebreathing before and after each camp, lasting 16 and 14 days, respectively. In addition, resting heart rate, peripheral oxygen saturation, body mass, fatigue, and sleep were monitored daily during both camps. Changes in tHbmass appeared not to be associated between the 2 camps (Hedges g = -0.81; P = .05; 95% CI, -1.68 to 0.06) nor with prealtitude tHbmass (camp 1: β = -0.04; P = .89; 95% CI, -0.61 to 0.54; camp 2: β = -0.42; P = .10; 95% CI, -0.94 to 0.10) or with prealtitude ferritin concentration (camp 1: β = -0.4; P = .14; 95% CI, -0.91 to 0.15; camp 2: β = 0.02; P = .95; 95% CI, -0.61 to 0.65). tHBmass values were correlated between the end of camp 1 and the start of camp 2 (r = .94; P < .001; 95% CI, .82-.98). Improved sleep quality in camp 1 was associated with an increase in tHBmass (β = 0.51; P = .04; 95% CI, 0.02 to 1.00). We observed a highly variable pattern of tHBmass responses in female water polo players undertaking 2 altitude training camps ∼5 months apart. Individualized training and management plans are likely required to complement team practices in altitude training camps undertaken by female team-sport athletes.",

    "title": "UCI Sports Nutrition Project: Nutritional Periodization: Strategies to Enhance Training Adaptation and Recovery.",
    "abstract": "The fundamental goal of nutrition for training is to provide the required energy and substrate to sustain the target training volume and intensity that is necessary to induce desired physiological adaptations. However, aside from fueling and recovery, it is now recognized that nutrient availability also modulates the activation of cell signaling pathways that regulate adaptations associated with both endurance and strength training. Such developments are the guiding principles underpinning \"nutritional periodization\" wherein energy, macronutrient, and micronutrient availability are deliberately manipulated across the microcycle, mesocycle, and macrocycle with the strategic goal to promote training adaptations, support recovery, manipulate body composition, and optimize competition performance. In addition to total \"daily\" nutrient intake, the elite athlete must, therefore, adjust their energy and carbohydrate intake in a meal-by-meal and day-by-day manner (i.e., carbohydrate periodization) in accordance with the energetic demands and training objectives of each specific training session. In addition to fueling (and refueling) for the work required, daily protein intake should at least be 1.6-2.1 g·kg-1·day-1 not only to account for amino acid oxidation during exercise but also, importantly, to promote tissue remodeling, notably skeletal muscle. Emerging evidence also supports the rationale for nutraceuticals to promote recovery and sleep, though the potential effect of such compounds in blunting training adaptation should also be considered. Taken together, it is increasingly clear that nutrition is a critical enabler to successful training outcomes, and as such, the sport nutritionist should be considered an integral member of an athlete's coaching and performance support team.",

    "abstract": "The athletes' energy and nutrient requirements are calculated based on individual energy expenditure and body composition indicators. This takes into account the different ratios of proteins, fats and carbohydrates recommended for sports with different physical activity levels, as well as the changing ratio of macronutrients depending on the physical activity coefficient. The purpose of the research was to assess the energy and nutrient requirements of female athletes involved in synchronized skating based on the results of assessing morphological indicators and daily energy expenditure. The study involved female athletes (n=22, age 21.4±4.5 years) specializing in synchronized skating, who were divided into three groups according to their sports ranks (8 candidates for master of sports, 10 masters of sports of Russia and 4 masters of sports of Russia of international class). Overall dimensions were assessed using anthropometry, body composition and basal metabolic rate were assessed using bioimpedancemetry, resting metabolic rate was assessed using indirect calorimetry, a dosed load test was performed on a bicycle ergometer, daily heart rate monitoring was performed, and athletes' daily activity was recorded using self-registration. Changes in morphological indices were revealed that occur when female athletes move from one athletic skill group to another, higher one. With the growth of athletic skill, female athletes become taller and more massive, their indices of metabolically active tissues (lean and skeletal-muscular) increase while maintaining the level of fat mass. In general, the basal metabolic rate of female athletes in the group was 1426 [1382; 1486] kcal/day, daily energy expenditure was 3177 [2788; 3507] kcal/day. Daily energy expenditure varied significantly and depended on both the training and non-training activities of the athletes. The calculation of the need for nutrients and energy complies with the requirements of MR 2.3.1.0253-21, as well as recommendations for the ratio of macronutrient shares in the diet of female athletes in complex coordination anaerobic sports, and with a Physical Activity Coefficients (PA Values) of 2.4, 2.6 and 2.8 was made based on the principle of not exceeding the need for macronutrients per 1 kg of body weight: in proteins - no more than 1.96 g/kg body weight; in fats - no more than 1.66 g/ kg body weight; in carbohydrates - on a residual basis. For athletes whose requirements exceed the regulated norms with PA Values of more than 2.2 (according to MR 2.3.1.0253-21), when calculating the need for proteins, fats and carbohydrates, and their share contribution to the calorie content of the diet, the percentage ratio of macronutrients should be changed depending on the need in grams per 1 kilogram of body weight.",

    "abstract": "Appropriate and adequate nutrition is essential for the health and performance of tactical athletes, including army recruits and trainees. However, previous research shows they commonly experience suboptimal intakes of energy and carbohydrate. To date, little research has been conducted to understand the causes of their poor dietary intakes. The objectives of this study were to (1) assess infantry trainees' dietary intakes and (2) explore their beliefs, barriers, and self-efficacy toward performance nutrition using the Health Belief Model (HBM). Participants undergoing their 17-week Australian Army Infantry Initial Employment Training (Infantry IET) were recruited. During weeks 1 and 17, self-reported dietary intakes were assessed, and four focus groups were conducted. Mean daily energy, carbohydrate, and protein intakes were 7864 ± 1135 kJ, 1.8 ± 0.6 g/kg, and 1.5 ± 0.3 g/kg, respectively, in week 1, and 9084 ± 2535 kJ/day, 2.2 ± 1.1 g/kg and 1.5 ± 0.2 g/kg, respectively, in week 17. Three themes and seven subthemes were developed from the focus group data, falling under the following HBM domains: Cues to Action, Perceived Barriers, and Self-Efficacy. Infantry trainees' ability to eat well for their health and performance was hindered by their limited time during their intensive training schedule, their limited access to a sufficient variety of healthy foods, and their limited self-efficacy regarding performance nutrition. They require further performance nutrition knowledge, especially in regard to adopting practical fueling and refueling strategies surrounding physical training, as well as access to a greater quantity and variety of healthy foods outside of their main mealtimes.",

    "abstract": "Compared to the general population, athletes experience high energy expenditures requiring increased energy and macronutrient intakes to sustain training and optimize performance. While the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and International Society for Sports Nutrition (ISSN) have established recommendations for nutrient intakes, many athletes do not meet the recommended daily allowance (RDA) for the general population, and sport and sex-specific differences are not well documented. Exploration of within-day energy balance (WDEB) shows athletes may achieve energy balance by the end of the day but may present with poor WDEB. Data support that female athletes are at greater risk of nutrient deficiencies than their male counterparts, and it is unclear whether swimmers meet sport-specific nutrient intake and timing recommendations. Following our previous WDEB analysis, the purpose of this investigation was to assess dietary macronutrient intake as related to RDAs (USDA and IOC/ISSN), within-day macronutrient timing, and associated sex differences in swimmers. In elite male and female swimmers ( When compared to IOC/ISSN daily recommendations, only 6/25 swimmers met FAT intake, 7/25 met CHO intake, and 24/25 met PRO intake IOC/ISSN daily recommendations.Males had greater EI and TDEE compared to females ( The results from this study demonstrate significant sex-differences, indicating that most swimmers meet athlete-specific recommendations for PRO, but not CHO or FAT intake. CHO timing for pre-, during, and post-exercise was met by only 52% swimmers. Results suggest that swimmers should prioritize CHO intake, emphasized around and during training bouts.",

This review explores the role of botulinum toxin type A (BoNT-A) in the treatment of spasticity, focusing on its effects on muscle structure and activity, function, cortical reorganization, and pain. Our findings indicate that BoNT-A injections improve motor function and gait, particularly in stroke patients, by reducing abnormal muscle activity and enhancing postural control. However, BoNT-A may also induce unwanted biomechanical changes, such as muscle atrophy and alterations in contractile elements, which could impact long-term muscle function. Regarding pain management in spasticity, BoNT-A has shown promise by reducing both peripheral and central sensitization mechanisms. Additionally, BoNT-A influences the central nervous system (CNS) by inducing cortical reorganization, which may further contribute to clinical improvements. Lastly, BoNT-A treatment requires careful consideration of individual patient characteristics to optimize outcomes and minimize side effects. A multidisciplinary approach that combines BoNT-A with physical therapy is essential to maximize functional recovery and improve the quality of life in patients with spasticity.",

    "abstract": "In the field of global health, meeting the energy requirements of athletes has surfaced as an essential concern. This study seeks to evaluate the effectiveness of royal jelly (RJ) in improving exercise performance in endurance-trained men. In this randomized, crossover, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we will enroll 18 male endurance athletes. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two conditions: the intervention condition, which will receive royal jelly (RJ) in 500 mg capsules taken orally twice daily for 2 weeks, or the control condition, which will receive a placebo consisting of 500 mg starch capsules taken orally twice daily for the same duration. The study will utilize a 2 × 2 crossover design with a 2-week washout period between treatments. To evaluate aerobic performance, we will determine each participant's maximal aerobic speed (MAS), followed by a test conducted at 80% of the MAS to measure time to exhaustion. Blood samples (5 cc) will be collected from all participants before and after the treadmill tests to analyze mRNA expressions of Nrf2 and PGC-1α, as well as oxidative stress parameters. Additionally, participants' dietary intake will be assessed using 3-day food records, and their blood pressure will be monitored before exercise, immediately after, and half an hour post-exercise. This trial aims to evaluate the effectiveness of RJ as a nutraceutical agent for enhancing endurance athletic performance. We anticipate that the results will provide new insights into the clinical and molecular benefits of RJ. Additionally, these findings will offer valuable data to guide the design and execution of future clinical research involving RJ. This study was registered in the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (registration No. IRCT20231209060310N1, date: December 21, 2023).",

    "abstract": "Knee arthrofibrosis, characterized by excessive matrix protein production and deposition, substantially impairs basic daily functions, causing considerable distress and financial burden. However, the underlying pathomechanisms remain unclear. Here, we characterized the heterogeneous cell populations and cellular pathways by combination of flow cytometry and single-cell RNA-seq analysis of synovial tissues from six patients with or without knee arthrofibrosis. Increased macrophages and fibroblasts were observed with decreased numbers of fibroblast-like synoviocytes, endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, and T cells in the arthrofibrosis group compared with negative controls. Notably, fibroblasts were discovered to interact with macrophages, and lead to fibrosis through TGF-β pathway induced CCN2 expression in fibroblasts. CCN2 was demonstrated to be required for fibroblast pro-fibrotic functions (activation, proliferation, and migration) through TGFBR/SMAD pathway. The expression of CCN2 was positively correlated with the collagen volume and TGF-β expression and negatively associated with patient-reported outcome measures in another cohort of patients with knee arthrofibrosis. Our study reveals the role of CCN2 in the fibroblast-macrophage interaction through TGF-β pathway which might help to shed light on CCN2 as a potential biomarker.",

    "title": "Fibre: The Forgotten Carbohydrate in Sports Nutrition Recommendations.",
    "abstract": "Although dietary guidelines concerning carbohydrate intake for athletes are well established, these do not include recommendations for daily fibre intake. However, there are many scenarios in sports nutrition in which common practice involves the manipulation of fibre intake to address gastrointestinal comfort around exercise, or acute or chronic goals around the management of body mass or composition. The effect of fibre intake in overall health is also important, particularly in combination with other dietary considerations such as the elevated protein requirements in this population. An athlete's habitual intake of dietary fibre should be assessed. If less than 20 g a day, athletes may consider dietary interventions to gradually increase intake. It is proposed that a ramp phase is adopted to gradually increase fibre ingestion to ~ 30 g of fibre a day (which includes ~ 2 g of beta-glucan) over a duration of 6 weeks. The outcomes of achieving a daily fibre intake are to help preserve athlete gut microbiome diversity and stability, intestinal barrier function as well as the downstream effects of short-chain fatty acids produced following the fermentation of microbiome accessible carbohydrates. Nevertheless, there are scenarios in which daily manipulation of fibre intake, either to reduce or increase intake, may be valuable in assisting the athlete to maintain gastrointestinal comfort during exercise or to contribute to body mass/composition goals. Although further research is required, the aim of this current opinion paper is to ensure that fibre is not forgotten as a nutrient in the athlete's diet.",

    "abstract": "Several observational and experimental studies in humans have suggested that high protein intake (PI) causes intraglomerular hypertension leading to hyperfiltration. This phenomenon results in progressive loss of renal function with long-term exposure to high-protein diets (HPDs), even in healthy people. The recommended daily allowance for PI is 0.83 g/kg per day, which meets the protein requirement for approximately 98% of the population. A HPD is defined as a protein consumption > 1.5 g/kg per day. Athletes and bodybuilders are encouraged to follow HPDs to optimize muscle protein balance, increase lean body mass, and enhance performance. A series of studies in resistance-trained athletes looking at HPD has been published concluding that there are no harmful effects of HPD on renal health. However, the aim of these studies was to evaluate body composition changes and they were not designed to assess safety or kidney outcomes. Here we review the effects of HPD on kidney health in athletes and healthy individuals with normal kidney function.",

    "abstract": "To test the effect of the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, liraglutide, on residual beta-cell function in adults with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes. In a multicentre, double-blind, parallel-group trial, adults with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes and stimulated C-peptide of more than 0.2 nmol/L were randomized (1:1) to 1.8-mg liraglutide (Victoza) or placebo once daily for 52 weeks with 6 weeks of follow-up with only insulin treatment. The primary endpoint was the between-group difference in C-peptide area under the curve (AUC) following a liquid mixed-meal test after 52 weeks of treatment. Sixty-eight individuals were randomized. After 52 weeks, the 4-hour AUC C-peptide response was maintained with liraglutide, but decreased with placebo (P = .002). Six weeks after end-of-treatment, C-peptide AUCs were similar for liraglutide and placebo. The average required total daily insulin dose decreased from 0.30 to 0.23 units/kg/day with liraglutide, but increased from 0.29 to 0.43 units/kg/day in the placebo group at week 52 (P < .001). Time without the need for insulin treatment was observed in 13 versus two patients and lasted for 22 weeks (from 3 to 52 weeks) versus 6 weeks (from 4 to 8 weeks) on average for liraglutide and placebo, respectively. Patients treated with liraglutide had fewer episodes of hypoglycaemia compared with placebo-treated patients. The adverse events with liraglutide were predominantly gastrointestinal and transient. Treatment with liraglutide improves residual beta-cell function and reduces the dose of insulin during the first year after diagnosis. Beta-cell function was similar at 6 weeks postliraglutide treatment.",

Whether energy deficit-induced anabolic resistance is overcome with non-nitrogenous supplemental energy or if increased energy as EAA is needed is unclear. We tested the effects of energy as EAA or carbohydrate, combined with an EAA-enriched whey protein, on postexercise MPS (%·h -1 ) and whole-body protein turnover (g protein·240 min -1 ). Seventeen adults (mean ± SD; age: 26 ± 6 yr, body mass index: 25 ± 3 kg·m -2 ) completed a randomized, parallel study including two 5-d energy conditions (BAL; energy balance; daily energy requirements (DEF), -30% ± 3% energy requirements) separated by ≥7 d. Volunteers consumed EAA-enriched whey with added EAA (+EAA; 304 kcal, 56 g protein, 48 g EAA, 17 g carbohydrate, 2 g fat; n = 8) or added carbohydrate (+CHO; 311 kcal, 34 g protein, 24 g EAA, 40 g carbohydrate, 2 g fat; n = 9) following exercise. MPS and whole-body protein synthesis (PS), breakdown (PB), and net balance (NET; PS-PB) were estimated postexercise with isotope kinetics. MPS rates were greater in +EAA (0.083 ± 0.02) than +CHO (0.059 ± 0.01; P = 0.015) during daily energy requirements, but similar during BAL ( P = 0.45) and across energy conditions within treatments ( P = 0.056). PS rates were greater for +EAA (BAL, 117.9 ± 16.5; daily energy requirements, 110.3 ± 14.8) than +CHO (BAL, 81.6 ± 8.0; daily energy requirements, 83.8 ± 5.9 g protein·240 min -1 ; both P < 0.001) and greater during BAL than daily energy requirements in +EAA ( P = 0.045). PB rates were less in +EAA (8.0 ± 16.5) than +CHO (37.8 ± 7.6 g protein·240 min -1 ; P < 0.001), and NET was greater in +EAA (106.1 ± 6.3) than +CHO (44.8 ± 8.5 g protein·240 min -1 ; P < 0.001). These data suggest that supplementing EAA-enriched whey protein with more energy as EAA, not carbohydrate, maintains postexercise MPS during energy deficit at rates comparable to those observed during energy balance.",

    "abstract": "The cornerstone in the management of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is lifestyle modification including a healthy diet, typically one in which carbohydrate provides 45%-60% of total energy intake (E%). Nevertheless, systematic reviews and meta-analyses of trials with low carbohydrate diets (which are increased in protein and/or fat) for T2D have found improved glycaemic control in the first months relative to comparator diets with higher carbohydrate content. Studies lasting ≥1 year are inconclusive, which could be due to decreased long-term dietary adherence. We hypothesise that glucometabolic benefits can be achieved following 12 months of carbohydrate-restricted dieting, by maximising dietary adherence through delivery of meal kits, containing fresh, high-quality ingredients for breakfast, dinner and snacks, combined with nutrition education and counselling. This protocol describes a 12-month investigator-initiated randomised controlled, open-label, superiority trial with two parallel groups that will examine the effect of a carbohydrate-reduced high-protein (CRHP) diet compared with a conventional diabetes (CD) diet on glucometabolic control (change in glycated haemoglobin being the primary outcome) in 100 individuals with T2D and body mass index (BMI) >25 kg/m The trial has been approved by the National Committee on Health Research Ethics of the Capital Region of Denmark. The trial will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Results will be submitted for publication in international peer-reviewed scientific journals. NCT05330247.

    "title": "Impact of Collagen Peptide Supplementation in Combination with Long-Term Physical Training on Strength, Musculotendinous Remodeling, Functional Recovery, and Body Composition in Healthy Adults: A Systematic Review with Meta-analysis.",
    "abstract": "Over the past decade, collagen peptide (CP) supplements have received considerable attention in sports nutrition research. These supplements have shown promising results in improving personal health, enhancing athletic performance, and preventing injuries in some but not all studies. A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) has been conducted to investigate the effects of long-term daily collagen peptide (CP) supplementation on strength, musculotendinous adaptation, functional recovery, and body composition in healthy adults, both with and without concurrent exercise interventions over several weeks. The PRISMA with PERSiST guidelines were followed for this systematic literature review, which was conducted in December 2023 using PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, and SPORTDiscus databases. Eligible studies included healthy, normal to overweight adults over 17 years of age who engaged in exercise and daily collagen peptide (CP) supplementation for a minimum of 8 weeks (except one 3-week trial only included for maximal strength). Studies examining recovery-related outcomes were also eligible if they included a 1-week supplementation period without exercise. Methodological study quality was assessed using the PEDro scale. A random-effects model with standardized mean differences (SMD) of change scores was chosen to calculate overall effect sizes. Nineteen studies comprising 768 participants were included in both the systematic review and meta-analysis. Results indicate statistically significant effects in favor of long-term CP intake regarding fat-free mass (FFM) (SMD 0.48, p < 0.01), tendon morphology (SMD 0.67, p < 0.01), muscle architecture (SMD 0.39, p < 0.01), maximal strength (SMD 0.19, p < 0.01), and 48 h recovery in reactive strength following exercise-induced muscle damage (SMD 0.43, p = 0.045). The GRADE approach revealed a moderate certainty of evidence for body composition, a very low certainty for tendon morphology and mechanical properties, and a low certainty for the remaining. This systematic review and meta-analysis represents the first comprehensive investigation into the effects of long-term CP supplementation combined with regular physical training on various aspects of musculoskeletal health in adults. The findings indicate significant, though of low to moderate certainty, evidence of improvements in fat-free mass (FFM), tendon morphology, muscle mass, maximal strength, and recovery in reactive strength following exercise-induced muscle damage. However, further research is required to fully understand the mechanisms underlying these effects, particularly regarding tendon mechanical properties and short-term adaptations to collagen peptide (CP) intake without exercise, as observed in recovery outcomes. Overall, CP supplementation appears promising as a beneficial adjunct to physical training for enhancing musculoskeletal performance in adults.

    "abstract": "Rugby athletes consume large amounts of animal protein in accordance with conventional dietary guidance to increase muscle mass and strength. This misaligns with national dietary guidelines, which suggest limiting meat consumption for chronic disease prevention. The ability of completely plant-based diets to satisfy the nutritional needs of rugby players has not been explored. This study scaled nutrient data from a large population consuming completely plant-based diets with limited supplemental protein to meet the calorie requirements of adult male rugby athletes to assess whether protein and leucine recommendations for muscular development and athletic performance would be achieved. Calorie requirements were estimated from research that employed the doubly labeled water method, and dietary data from the Adventist Health Study-2 were scaled to this level. The modeled protein level was 1.68 g/kg/day, which meets recommendations for maximal gains in muscle mass, strength, and athletic performance. The modeled leucine level was 2.9 g/meal for four daily meals, which exceeds the threshold proposed to maximally stimulate muscle protein synthesis in young men. These results indicate that consuming large portions of completely plant-based meals can satisfy protein and leucine requirements for maximal muscular development and athletic performance in adult male rugby athletes while aligning with public health recommendations.",

    "title": "Subchronic administration of scopolamine reverses UCMS-induced behavior in mice via eEF2 protein dephosphorylation.",
    "abstract": "The cholinergic system has been increasingly linked to the pathophysiology of mood disorders such as depression, with the potential involvement of nicotinic and/or muscarinic receptors. Conventional antidepressants usually require weeks of daily dosing to achieve a full antidepressant response. In contrast, clinical studies have shown that scopolamine, a nonselective muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist, can induce potent and rapid antidepressant effects, requiring only a few days of treatment. This study aimed to examine the suitability of the unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) model of depression to reproduce the above scopolamine antidepressant activity patterns. Rapid and sustained antidepressant-like effects were assessed by using the splash test, sucrose preference test (SPT), tail suspension test (TST), and forced swimming test (FST) in animals undergoing the UCMS procedure and stress-naïve C57BL/6J mice. Western Blotting was used to measure tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), eukaryotic elongation factor (eEF2) and postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95) levels. Scopolamine induced antidepressant-like effects in a dose-dependent manner only after subchronic, but not single, administration in the UCMS model of depression in C57BL/6J mice without affecting locomotor activity. Specifically, scopolamine administered at a dose of 0.3 mg/kg for four consecutive days significantly reversed the UCMS-induced depressive-like behavior, such as apathy, anhedonia, and behavioral despair, while scopolamine, given at the same dose but only once, did not relieve the above symptoms. Scopolamine treatment was accompanied by eEF2 protein dephosphorylation and its subsequent reactivation in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Subchronic administration of scopolamine is needed to ameliorate UCMS-induced depressive-like behavior. The suggested mechanism of scopolamine action covers eEF2 protein activity in the PFC.",

    "abstract": "In the management of osteoporosis, anti-resorptive agents serve as a primary therapeutic approach. However, in cases where individuals exhibit an increased susceptibility to fractures, such as those characterized by severe low bone mass or a history of vertebral or hip fractures that markedly diminish life expectancy, the immediate reduction of fracture risk through the administration of osteoanabolic agents could be beneficial. Teriparatide, available in daily, once-weekly, or twice-weekly dosages, along with abaloparatide and romosozumab, constitutes a trio of such agents. Each of these medications is defined by unique characteristics, distinct efficacy profiles, and specific adverse effects. There is growing evidence to suggest that these agents have a superior effect on enhancing bone mineral density and reducing fracture incidence when compared to traditional bisphosphonate therapies. Nonetheless, their employment demands thorough consideration of clinical indications, which includes evaluating economic factors, the frequency of injections required, and the potential for adverse effects. The objective of this review is to consolidate the current evidence focusing primarily on the efficacy of these agents, with the goal of enhancing understanding and aiding in making more informed treatment decisions, particularly for those individuals who are at an elevated risk of fractures.",

Across all match days, 71% (n = 12) of athletes met their predicted daily energy requirements. However, 82% (n = 14) failed to meet minimum daily carbohydrate recommendations; intake was lower on early compared with late match days (4.7 g/day vs. 5.4 g/kg/day, p = 0.027). On average, no athletes met carbohydrate recommendations in the 2 h prior to a match and only 24% (n = 4) met recommendations during matches. All athletes met post-match carbohydrate and protein requirements. Athletes cover large distances during games with frequent bursts of high-intensity running. However, they do not adjust their intake to meet the energy demands of competition, with inadequate fuelling prior to and during matches. These findings emphasise the need for greater athlete education and dietary support to maximise strategic fuelling to optimise athletic performance.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this narrative review is to create a comprehensive, innovative, and pragmatic resource to guide elite fencers and coaches in making strategic nutritional choices to enhance performance and facilitate recovery. The literature review identified only 12 articles specifically addressing the topic of nutrition for fencers. Thus, the recommendations provided in this review derive also from articles dealing with similar sports, such as martial arts, and from investigations with European elite fencers and their coaches. For elite fencers, it is suggested to consume daily 7-11 g/kg of body weight (BW) of carbohydrates and 1.5-2 g/kg of BW of proteins and allocate 25% to 30% of the total energy intake to essential fats, with a specific focus on omega-3 fatty acids. The timing of meals, ideally within one hour after exertion, plays a pivotal role in restoring glycogen reserves and preventing injuries. The intake of leucine, creatine, omega-3, collagen, and vitamins C and D is proposed as a strategy for injury recovery. It is worth acknowledging that even when personalized plans are provided, implementation can be challenging, especially during competitions and training camps.",

    "abstract": "Protein supplementation often refers to increasing the intake of this particular macronutrient through dietary supplements in the form of powders, ready-to-drink shakes, and bars. The primary purpose of protein supplementation is to augment dietary protein intake, aiding individuals in meeting their protein requirements, especially when it may be challenging to do so through regular food (i.e. chicken, beef, fish, pork, etc.) sources alone. A large body of evidence shows that protein has an important role in exercising and sedentary individuals. A PubMed search of \"protein and exercise performance\" reveals thousands of publications. Despite the considerable volume of evidence, it is somewhat surprising that several persistent questions and misconceptions about protein exist. The following are addressed: 1) Is protein harmful to your kidneys? 2) Does consuming \"excess\" protein increase fat mass? 3) Can dietary protein have a harmful effect on bone health? 4) Can vegans and vegetarians consume enough protein to support training adaptations? 5) Is cheese or peanut butter a good protein source? 6) Does consuming meat (i.e., animal protein) cause unfavorable health outcomes? 7) Do you need protein if you are not physically active? 8) Do you ",

To unlock their full potential, athletes must adhere to a well-balanced diet tailored to their specific nutritional needs. This approach not only enables them to achieve optimal performance levels but also facilitates efficient recovery and reduces the risk of injuries. In addition to maintaining a balanced diet, many athletes also embrace the use of nutritional supplements to complement their dietary intake and support their training goals. These supplements cover a wide range of options, addressing nutrient deficiencies, enhancing recovery, promoting muscle synthesis, boosting energy levels, and optimizing performance in their respective sports or activities. The primary objective of this narrative review is to comprehensively explore the diverse nutritional requirements that athletes face to optimize their performance, recovery, and overall well-being. Through a thorough literature search across databases such as PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus, we aim to provide evidence-based recommendations and shed light on the optimal daily intakes of carbohydrates, protein, fats, micronutrients, hydration strategies, ergogenic aids, nutritional supplements, and nutrient timing. Furthermore, our aim is to dispel common misconceptions regarding sports nutrition, providing athletes with accurate information and empowering them in their nutritional choices.",

    "title": "Pattern of dietary supplement use and its psychosocial predictors among females visiting fitness centers in Saudi Arabia: Findings from a cross-sectional study.",
    "abstract": "Establishing a balanced diet is necessary for obtaining the required daily micronutrients and macronutrients. However, the importance of using dietary supplements to complement one's diet is a significant aspect to consider. While studies have reported the prevalence and patterns of dietary supplements in Saudi Arabia, most focused on university students, women in their reproductive life-particularly during pregnancy-or male athletes. Hence, the objective of this study is to estimate the prevalence and patterns of dietary supplement usage, along with the associated sociodemographic and psychiatric predictors among women attending fitness centers in Saudi Arabia. A cross-sectional design was utilized using a structured questionnaire to collect data on dietary intakes such as consumption, nutrition supplements, type of nutrition supplements, and reason for consuming dietary supplements. Data collection occurred in female fitness centers, with participants accessing the questionnaires through QR codes linked to online Google forms. The dietary usage was assessed using a structured questionnaire developed by the study authors, and depressive and anxiety symptoms were assessed using the PHQ-9 and the GAD-7 scales, respectively. SPSS 23.0 was utilized to analyze the data, and a multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the association between sociodemographic and psychiatric predictors and patterns of dietary supplement usage. The results were presented by reporting an unadjusted and adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with 95 % Confidence Intervals (CIs). The total number of participants in this study was 453 women. Half of the 453 women (46.1 %) consumed dietary supplements, and (84.0 %) reported taking proteins, caffeine, creatinine, mineral salts, fish oil, and/or amino acids or a combination of these dietary supplements. A considerable number of women (41.0 %) reported that a doctor, dietitian, or trainer motivated them to take the dietary supplement, and (38.0 %) of women self-prescribed dietary supplements. More than half (51 %) of the women consumed dietary supplements to compensate for nutrient deficiency, and 48 % used them to improve their health. Women who did not work to earn were 53 % less likely to consume dietary supplements (AOR = 0.47; [95 % CI: 0.30-0.72]) than women who reported working to earn either in the private or government sector. Depressed women were (42 %) less likely to consume dietary supplements than non-depressed women (AOR = 0.58; [95 % CI: 0.33-0.99]) after adjusting for sociodemographic variables and other medical conditions. It has been evident that a large proportion of women enrolled in the fitness center report consuming dietary supplements, mostly to compensate for energy and to improve overall health. The findings highlight that non-working and depressed women were less likely to use dietary supplements than their counterparts. By understanding these patterns, the community can tailor health interventions and policies to ensure equitable access to proper dietary support, especially for those facing challenges like depression and unemployment. Future research on a larger sample of women outside fitness centers is encouraged to explore further dietary supplement consumption and patterns among diverse population groups, and to ultimately develop health guidelines for the appropriate use of supplements.",

    "abstract": "In wealthy countries, the protein intake of adults is usually considered to be adequate, and considerations of protein quality are often deemed irrelevant. The objective was to examine dietary protein intakes of adults in developed countries in the context of dietary protein quality. An analysis of NHANES population data on actual protein intakes in the United States (a developed country) demonstrated that for a dietary Digestible Indispensable Amino Acid Score (DIAAS) of 100%, 11% of the adult (19-50 y) population had habitual protein intakes below the Estimated Average Requirement (EAR) and 22% below the Recommended Dietary Allowance. The percentage of the population with utilizable protein intakes potentially falling below the EAR increased as the assumed DIAAS declined. Analysis of the NHANES data and several other datasets also indicated that total protein intakes can be limiting or close to limiting for the elderly and some vegetarians and vegans. Here, lower dietary protein quality can potentially lead to inadequate utilizable protein intakes. For many people in specific physiological states (e.g., weight loss, endurance sports, resistance exercise) attempting to meet higher dietary protein targets often with accompanying lowered energy intakes, low dietary protein quality can lead to protein calories expressed as a proportion of total calories, falling outside what may be acceptable limits (maximum of 30% protein calories from total calories). In general, individuals within the adult population may be susceptible to macronutrient imbalance (whenever total protein intakes are high, daily energy intakes low) and for diets with lower protein quality (DIAAS <100%). Our analysis shows that dietary protein quality is relevant in mid- to high-income countries.",

    "title": "Energy Requirements of Paralympic Athletes: Insights from the Doubly Labeled Water Approach.",
    "abstract": "Advanced insight in energy requirements of Paralympic athletes is imperative for optimizing their nutritional counseling. Given the lack of accurate data on total daily energy expenditure (TDEE) of Paralympic athletes, this study aimed to assess energy expenditure and nutritional intake of a large cohort of Paralympic athletes, across different sports and disabilities. In this cross-sectional study, 48 Dutch and Norwegian Paralympic athletes (19 male/29 female) with various disabilities, competing in Para cycling, wheelchair tennis, wheelchair basketball, Para Nordic skiing, and alpine skiing participated. TDEE was assessed by the gold standard doubly labeled water method over a 14-d period, resting metabolic rate by ventilated hood indirect calorimetry, energy intake by three unannounced 24-h dietary recalls, body composition by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, and exercise training duration by a training log. Mean TDEE was 2908 ± 797 kcal·d -1 , ranging from 2322 ± 340 kcal·d -1 for wheelchair basketball players to 3607 ± 1001 kcal·d -1 for Para cyclists. Regression analysis identified fat-free mass, exercise duration, and the presence of a spinal cord disorder as the primary predictors of TDEE, explaining up to 73% of the variance in TDEE. Athletes' energy intake (2363 ± 905 kcal·d -1 ) was below their TDEE, whereas their body mass remained constant, indicating underreporting. Carbohydrate intake (4.1 ± 1.9 g·kg -1 body mass) was low, even when considering underreporting, whereas protein intake (1.8 ± 0.6 g·kg -1 body mass) was relatively high. Paralympic athletes display moderate- to high-energy expenditure, varying across sports and individuals. Much of the variation in TDEE can be attributed to individual differences in fat-free mass and exercise duration. This study establishes the benchmarks for energy requirements of Paralympic athletes, serving as the foundation for future dietary guidelines within this population.",

    "abstract": "Physical inactivity, sedentary behaviour (SB), and inadequate sleep are key behavioural risk factors of cardiometabolic diseases. Each behaviour is mainly considered in isolation, despite clear behavioural and biological interdependencies. The aim of this study was to investigate associations of five-part movement compositions with adiposity and cardiometabolic biomarkers. Cross-sectional data from six studies (n = 15 253 participants; five countries) from the Prospective Physical Activity, Sitting and Sleep consortium were analysed. Device-measured time spent in sleep, SB, standing, light-intensity physical activity (LIPA), and moderate-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) made up the composition. Outcomes included body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, HDL cholesterol, total:HDL cholesterol ratio, triglycerides, and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c). Compositional linear regression examined associations between compositions and outcomes, including modelling time reallocation between behaviours. The average daily composition of the sample (age: 53.7 ± 9.7 years; 54.7% female) was 7.7 h sleeping, 10.4 h sedentary, 3.1 h standing, 1.5 h LIPA, and 1.3 h MVPA. A greater MVPA proportion and smaller SB proportion were associated with better outcomes. Reallocating time from SB, standing, LIPA, or sleep into MVPA resulted in better scores across all outcomes. For example, replacing 30 min of SB, sleep, standing, or LIPA with MVPA was associated with -0.63 (95% confidence interval -0.48, -0.79), -0.43 (-0.25, -0.59), -0.40 (-0.25, -0.56), and -0.15 (0.05, -0.34) kg/m2 lower BMI, respectively. Greater relative standing time was beneficial, whereas sleep had a detrimental association when replacing LIPA/MVPA and positive association when replacing SB. The minimal displacement of any behaviour into MVPA for improved cardiometabolic health ranged from 3.8 (HbA1c) to 12.7 (triglycerides) min/day. Compositional data analyses revealed a distinct hierarchy of behaviours. Moderate-vigorous physical activity demonstrated the strongest, most time-efficient protective associations with cardiometabolic outcomes. Theoretical benefits from reallocating SB into sleep, standing, or LIPA required substantial changes in daily activity.",

    "abstract": "The circadian clock in tendon regulates the daily rhythmic synthesis of collagen-I and the appearance and disappearance of small-diameter collagen fibrils in the extracellular matrix. How the fibrils are assembled and removed is not fully understood. Here, we first showed that the collagenase, membrane type I-matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP, encoded by Mmp14), is regulated by the circadian clock in postnatal mouse tendon. Next, we generated tamoxifen-induced Col1a2-Cre-ERT2::Mmp14 KO mice (Mmp14 conditional knockout (CKO)). The CKO mice developed hind limb dorsiflexion and thickened tendons, which accumulated narrow-diameter collagen fibrils causing ultrastructural disorganization. Mass spectrometry of control tendons identified 1195 proteins of which 212 showed time-dependent abundance. In Mmp14 CKO mice 19 proteins had reversed temporal abundance and 176 proteins lost time dependency. Among these, the collagen crosslinking enzymes lysyl oxidase-like 1 (LOXL1) and lysyl hydroxylase 1 (LH1; encoded by Plod2) were elevated and had lost time-dependent regulation. High-pressure chromatography confirmed elevated levels of hydroxylysine aldehyde (pyridinoline) crosslinking of collagen in CKO tendons. As a result, collagen-I was refractory to extraction. We also showed that CRISPR-Cas9 deletion of Mmp14 from cultured fibroblasts resulted in loss of circadian clock rhythmicity of period 2 (PER2), and recombinant MT1-MMP was highly effective at cleaving soluble collagen-I but less effective at cleaving collagen pre-assembled into fibrils. In conclusion, our study shows that circadian clock-regulated Mmp14 controls the rhythmic synthesis of small diameter collagen fibrils, regulates collagen crosslinking, and its absence disrupts the circadian clock and matrisome in tendon fibroblasts.",

    "title": "Dietary protein recommendations to support healthy muscle ageing in the 21st century and beyond: considerations and future directions.",
    "abstract": "This review explores the evolution of dietary protein intake requirements and recommendations, with a focus on skeletal muscle remodelling to support healthy ageing based on presentations at the 2023 Nutrition Society summer conference. In this review, we describe the role of dietary protein for metabolic health and ageing muscle, explain the origins of protein and amino acid (AA) requirements and discuss current recommendations for dietary protein intake, which currently sits at about 0⋅8 g/kg/d. We also critique existing (e.g. nitrogen balance) and contemporary (e.g. indicator AA oxidation) methods to determine protein/AA intake requirements and suggest that existing methods may underestimate requirements, with more contemporary assessments indicating protein recommendations may need to be increased to >1⋅0 g/kg/d. One example of evolution in dietary protein guidance is the transition from protein requirements to recommendations. Hence, we discuss the refinement of protein/AA requirements for skeletal muscle maintenance with advanced age beyond simply the dose (e.g. source, type, quality, timing, pattern, nutrient co-ingestion) and explore the efficacy and sustainability of alternative protein sources beyond animal-based proteins to facilitate skeletal muscle remodelling in older age. We conclude that, whilst a growing body of research has demonstrated that animal-free protein sources can effectively stimulate and support muscle remodelling in a manner that is comparable to animal-based proteins, food systems need to sustainably provide a diversity of both plant and animal source foods, not least for their protein content but other vital nutrients. Finally, we propose some priority research directions for the field of protein nutrition and healthy ageing.",

    "title": "International Society of Sports Nutrition Position Stand: Effects of essential amino acid supplementation on exercise and performance.",
    "abstract": "Position Statement: The International Society of Sports Nutrition (ISSN) presents this position based on a critical examination of literature surrounding the effects of essential amino acid (EAA) supplementation on skeletal muscle maintenance and performance. This position stand is intended to provide a scientific foundation to athletes, dietitians, trainers, and other practitioners as to the benefits of supplemental EAA in both healthy and resistant (aging/clinical) populations. EAAs are crucial components of protein intake in humans, as the body cannot synthesize them. The daily recommended intake (DRI) for protein was established to prevent deficiencies due to inadequate EAA consumption. The following conclusions represent the official position of the Society: 1. Initial studies on EAAs' effects on skeletal muscle highlight their primary role in stimulating muscle protein synthesis (MPS) and turnover. Protein turnover is critical for replacing degraded or damaged muscle proteins, laying the metabolic foundation for enhanced functional performance. Consequently, research has shifted to examine the effects of EAA supplementation - with and without the benefits of exercise - on skeletal muscle maintenance and performance. 2. Supplementation with free-form EAAs leads to a quick rise in peripheral EAA concentrations, which in turn stimulates MPS. 3. The safe upper limit of EAA intake (amount), without inborn metabolic disease, can easily accommodate additional supplementation. 4. At rest, stimulation of MPS occurs at relatively small dosages (1.5-3.0 g) and seems to plateau at around 15-18 g. 5. The MPS stimulation by EAAs does not require non-essential amino acids. 6. Free-form EAA ingestion stimulates MPS more than an equivalent amount of intact protein. 7. Repeated EAA-induced MPS stimulation throughout the day does not diminish the anabolic effect of meal intake. 8. Although direct comparisons of various formulas have yet to be investigated, aging requires a greater proportion of leucine to overcome the reduced muscle sensitivity known as \"anabolic resistance.\" 9. Without exercise, EAA supplementation can enhance functional outcomes in anabolic-resistant populations. 10. EAA requirements rise in the face of caloric deficits. During caloric deficit, it's essential to meet whole-body EAA requirements to preserve anabolic sensitivity in skeletal muscle.",

    "title": "Limits of Ultra: Towards an Interdisciplinary Understanding of Ultra-Endurance Running Performance.",
    "abstract": "Ultra-endurance running (UER) poses extreme mental and physical challenges that present many barriers to completion, let alone performance. Despite these challenges, participation in UER events continues to increase. With the relative paucity of research into UER training and racing compared with traditional endurance running distance (e.g., marathon), it follows that there are sizable improvements still to be made in UER if the limitations of the sport are sufficiently understood. The purpose of this review is to summarise our current understanding of the major limitations in UER. We begin with an evolutionary perspective that provides the critical background for understanding how our capacities, abilities and limitations have come to be. Although we show that humans display evolutionary adaptations that may bestow an advantage for covering large distances on a daily basis, these often far exceed the levels of our ancestors, which exposes relative limitations. From that framework, we explore the physiological and psychological systems required for running UER events. In each system, the factors that limit performance are highlighted and some guidance for practitioners and future research are shared. Examined systems include thermoregulation, oxygen delivery and utilisation, running economy and biomechanics, fatigue, the digestive system, nutritional and psychological strategies. We show that minimising the cost of running, damage to lower limb tissue and muscle fatigability may become crucial in UER events. Maintaining a sustainable core body temperature is critical to performance, and an even pacing strategy, strategic heat acclimation and individually calculated hydration all contribute to sustained performance. Gastrointestinal issues affect almost every UER participant and can be due to a variety of factors. We present nutritional strategies for different event lengths and types, such as personalised and evidence-based approaches for varying types of carbohydrate, protein and fat intake in fluid or solid form, and how to avoid flavour fatigue. Psychology plays a vital role in UER performance, and we highlight the need to be able to cope with complex situations, and that specific long and short-term goal setting improves performance. Fatigue in UER is multi-factorial, both physical and mental, and the perceived effort or level of fatigue have a major impact on the ability to continue at a given pace. Understanding the complex interplay of these limitations will help prepare UER competitors for the different scenarios they are likely to face. Therefore, this review takes an interdisciplinary approach to synthesising and illuminating limitations in UER performance to assist practitioners and scientists in making informed decisions in practice and applicable research.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to determine the daily protein requirements of female and male endurance athletes in a home-based setting using noninvasive stable isotope methodology (i.e., indicator amino acid oxidation). Eight males (30 ± 3 yr; 78.6 ± 10.5 kg; 75.6 ± 7.5 mL·kgFFM-1·min-1; mean ± SD) and seven females (30 ± 4 yr; 57.7 ± 5.0 kg; 77.5 ± 7.1 mL·kgFFM-1·min-1) during the midluteal phase were studied. After 2 d of controlled diet (1.4 gprotein·kg-1·d-1) and training (10 and 5 km run·d-1, respectively), participants completed a 20-km run before an at-home indicator amino acid oxidation trial testing a suboptimal, a moderate, and an excess (i.e., 0.2, 1.2, and 2.0 g·kg-1·d-1, respectively) protein intake. Protein was consumed as a crystalline amino acid mixture containing [1-13C]phenylalanine to examine whole-body phenylalanine flux and phenylalanine oxidation (PheOx; the reciprocal of whole-body protein synthesis) through breath and urine sample collection. A modified biphasic linear regression determined the breakpoint in PheOx for each participant to generate an estimated average intake that would maximize whole-body protein synthesis for each sex. PheOx was different (P < 0.01) between all protein intakes with no effect of sex (P = 0.63). Using a modified three-point curve resulted in a breakpoint that was not different (P = 0.94) between males and females (1.60 and 1.61 g·kg-1·d-1, respectively). The recommended intake (i.e., upper 95% confidence interval) was estimated to be 1.81 and 1.89 g·kg-1·d-1 for males and females, respectively. Our findings indicate that endurance athletes consuming a daily protein intake toward the upper end of current consensus recommendations (~1.85 g·kg-1·d-1) will maximize whole-body protein synthesis during postexercise recovery regardless of sex.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, as awareness of healthy diets has increased, consumers are becoming more aware of their food and are paying more attention to their diet. Nutritionists have recommended an increased consumption of dietary fiber in the daily diet to improve health. Within this context, this work aims to formulate \"spaghetti\" pasta enriched with lupin flour and wheat bran. For the formulation of the mixture of those flours, we used the NemrodW software to predict the optimal pasta formula. A physicochemical characterization, as well as the culinary quality of the pasta resulting from the different mixtures, was carried out to model each significant criterion and choose the optimal mixture that will be used in the pasta recipe. The evaluation of the physicochemical characteristics of the pasta showed that the addition of lupin flour and bran resulted in an improvement in the nutritional value of the enriched spaghetti. Following the results obtained, the software proposed an optimal mix and will be used for further study. This formula comprises 19.60% bran, 27.83% lupin flour, and 52.75% durum wheat semolina. The caloric value of the dough from the optimal mix was determined and compared to that of the standard dough. The results of our study indicated a significant improvement in the nutritional value of the enriched pasta compared to the standard pasta. The enriched pasta contained higher levels of protein, ash, lipids, polyphenols, and pigments and lower levels of sugars, which make it a more nutritious option for certain individuals, such as athletes or those following a protein or low-sugar diet. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: The proposed method of substituting wheat semolina with lupine flour and wheat bran in spaghetti formulation has demonstrated a potential for producing protein-rich and nutritionally enriched pasta. This approach can be useful for developing similar functional food products that cater to the dietary requirements of athletes or individuals following a protein or low-sugar diet.",

    "abstract": "To examine the effect of combination exercise program on cognitive function of older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and identify biomarkers associated with improvement of cognitive functions. Subjects were 42 older adults (ages, 60-80 years) with MCI. The subjects were randomly classified to traditional Chinese exercise combined with rhythm training group (TCE + RTG, n = 14), walking group (WG, n = 14), and control group (CG, n = 14), according to their level of MMSE scores. These groups exercised for 60 minutes at 1 session, 3 sessions a week for 12 weeks. The intervention program was conducted under multitask conditions to stimulate attention and memory, and the control group attended 3 education classes. Measurements were administered before, after the 6-week, and after the 12-week intervention period; Measurements: The Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), Activities of Daily Living Scale (ADL), and the 17-item Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD-17), along with the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). A repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to examine differences among the 3 groups and between the 3 testing times (pre-test vs middle-test vs post-test).

    "abstract": "The aim of this systematic review is twofold: (i) to examine the effects of micronutrient intake on athletic performance and (ii) to determine the specific micronutrients, such as vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, that offer the most significant enhancements in terms of athletic performance, with the goal of providing guidance to athletes and coaches in optimizing their nutritional strategies. The study conducted a systematic search of electronic databases (i.e., PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus) using keywords pertaining to micronutrients, athletic performance, and exercise. The search involved particular criteria of studies published in English between 1950 and 2023. The findings suggest that vitamins and minerals are crucial for an athlete's health and physical performance, and no single micronutrient is more important than others. Micronutrients are necessary for optimal metabolic body's functions such as energy production, muscle growth, and recovery, which are all important for sport performance. Meeting the daily intake requirement of micronutrients is essential for athletes, and while a balanced diet that includes healthy lean protein sources, whole grains, fruits, and vegetables is generally sufficient, athletes who are unable to meet their micronutrient needs due to malabsorption or specific deficiencies may benefit from taking multivitamin supplements. However, athletes should only take micronutrient supplements with the consultation of a specialized physician or nutritionist and avoid taking them without confirming a deficiency.",

    "abstract": "Elite rugby union players face numerous physiological and psychological stressors which can increase upper respiratory and gastrointestinal illness risk, and in turn can compromise training and competitive performance. This study aimed to investigate the effect of daily prebiotic supplementation on upper respiratory symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, and markers of immune function in elite rugby union players. Thirty-three elite rugby union players were randomly assigned to consume a prebiotic (2.8 g/day galactooligosaccharide) or placebo (2.8 g/day maltodextrin), daily for 168 days under double-blind conditions. Participants completed daily and weekly questionnaires for self-reported upper respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms respectively. Blood and saliva samples were collected at 0, 84, and 168 days for assessment of plasma TNF-α and CRP, and saliva IgA respectively. The prebiotic group experienced a 2-day reduction in upper respiratory symptom duration ( A 168-day dietary prebiotic intervention reduced the duration of upper respiratory symptoms and reduced the incidence and severity of gastrointestinal symptoms in elite rugby union players. These findings suggest that seasonal prebiotic interventions may be beneficial for reducing illness in elite rugby union players, improving their availability to train and compete.",

In this study, we conducted a descriptive assessment of dietary intake, energy availability (EA), and blood biochemical parameters in elite wheelchair athletes during distinct training phases. Data analyzed in this study were collected as part of a randomized controlled crossover trial exploring the feasibility of probiotics and prebiotic supplementation. Data were obtained from consecutive three-day diaries and blood samples, both collected at four different time points across four consecutive months. We included 14 athletes (mean (standard deviation) age 34 (9) years, eight females, and six males) active in different wheelchair sports.

    "abstract": "Based on a comprehensive review and critical analysis of the literature regarding the nutritional concerns of female athletes, conducted by experts in the field and selected members of the International Society of Sports Nutrition (ISSN), the following conclusions represent the official Position of the Society: 1. Female athletes have unique and unpredictable hormone profiles, which influence their physiology and nutritional needs across their lifespan. To understand how perturbations in these hormones affect the individual, we recommend that female athletes of reproductive age should track their hormonal status (natural, hormone driven) against training and recovery to determine their individual patterns and needs and peri and post-menopausal athletes should track against training and recovery metrics to determine the individuals' unique patterns. 2. The primary nutritional consideration for all athletes, and in particular, female athletes, should be achieving adequate energy intake to meet their energy requirements and to achieve an optimal energy availability (EA); with a focus on the timing of meals in relation to exercise to improve training adaptations, performance, and athlete health. 3. Significant sex differences and sex hormone influences on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism are apparent, therefore we recommend first ensuring athletes meet their carbohydrate needs across all phases of the menstrual cycle. Secondly, tailoring carbohydrate intake to hormonal status with an emphasis on greater carbohydrate intake and availability during the active pill weeks of oral contraceptive users and during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle where there is a greater effect of sex hormone suppression on gluconogenesis output during exercise. 4. Based upon the limited research available, we recommend that pre-menopausal, eumenorrheic, and oral contraceptives using female athletes should aim to consume a source of high-quality protein as close to beginning and/or after completion of exercise as possible to reduce exercise-induced amino acid oxidative losses and initiate muscle protein remodeling and repair at a dose of 0.32-0.38 g·kg",

Furthermore, the daily distribution of energy and macronutrient intake throughout the day has been reported to influence training adaptations, but this is often not considered in the literature. This study aims to quantify daily energy and macronutrient intake and assess their distribution over 5 days, and compare daily energy intakes and predicted daily energy expenditure in under-16 male soccer players. The sample included 25 soccer participants aged 14.8-15.7 years. Five-day self-reported food diaries were used to record the food/drink consumption. Intake was analyzed for total daily energy, macronutrient intakes, and distribution among meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks). Daily energy expenditure was predicted by resting energy expenditure and physical activity levels developed for youth sports participants. The mean total energy intake was 1,928 ± 388 kcal∙day Youth soccer players do not appear to meet energy requirements and daily CHO guidelines. Fluctuations in protein intake throughout the day were noted and may influence training adaptations (i.e., muscle protein synthesis and recovery).",

    "title": "Hungry runners - low energy availability in male endurance athletes and its impact on performance and testosterone: mini-review.",
    "abstract": "Low Energy Availability (LEA) arises from the inability to cover energy needs and requirements of training or normal physiological functions. This value differs from the energy balance, which takes into account the total daily energy intake compared to all the energy expended, regardless of the amount of fat-free mass. Insufficient energy consumption affects recovery, adaptation processes, increases the risk of injury or illness, so all of this can negatively affect performance. This mini-review is written on research articles in Pubmed database related to LEA in endurance-trained men and its impact on performance and testosterone. This article also clarifies the prevalence of LEA in male endurance athletes and its correlation to Relative Energy Deficiency in Sports (RED-S). LEA occurs in male endurance athletes and correlates with decreased testosterone levels, decreased bone density and also Resting Metabolic Rate. In endurance-trained men, there is great potential for the negative consequences of low energy availability. It can also be said that there are possibilities for primary screening, so we recommend regular check-ups of blood markers, body structure and keeping not only training but also dietary records, which can increase awareness of an adequate energy balance.",

    "abstract": "Dietary protein is required to support recovery and adaptation following exercise training. While prior research demonstrates that many athletes meet total daily protein needs, intake seems to be predominantly skewed toward the evening meal. An even distribution of protein doses of ≥0.24 g/kg BW consumed throughout the course of a day is theorized to confer greater skeletal muscle anabolism outcomes compared to a skewed pattern of intake. Protein quality is also an important dietary consideration for athletes, with the amino acid leucine seemingly serving as the primary driver of the postprandial anabolic response. The present study investigates protein consumption characteristics among a cohort of NCAA D1 soccer players and evaluates differences between male and female athletes. Athletes were instructed to complete 3-day food diaries, which were subsequently analyzed and compared to UEFA expert group-issued nutrition guidelines for soccer players. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner accounted for 81.4% of the total daily dietary protein intake. Most athletes (77.8%) ingested optimum amounts of protein at dinner but not at breakfast (11.1%) or lunch (47.2%). In addition, statistically significant sex-based differences in daily dietary protein intake, meal-specific protein amounts, and protein quality measures were detected. Findings indicate suboptimal dietary protein intake practices among the collegiate soccer athletes.",

    "abstract": "Table tennis (TT) is the second most popular racket sport globally and was the sixth most widely played Olympic sport in 2005. It is an indoor racket sport requiring a mixture of power, agility, alertness and fast reactions. Players need to move quickly around a table to receive the ball and produce powerful returns. New rules such as increased ball size and a change in ball material have changed the ball's trajectory, increasing the overall duration and intensity of game play. Scientific research on TT is growing but there has been no systematic review of nutrition for the sport. This review provides nutritional recommendations for TT athletes based on the physiological demands of TT, including energy expenditure during training and competitions, and the main metabolic pathways of TT. Guidelines on the daily intakes of carbohydrate, protein and fat are discussed in addition to hydration strategies. Micronutrients of concern for TT athletes include iron, magnesium and vitamin D and their recommended intakes are also provided. The timing and dose of ergogenic aids that may improve TT performance such as caffeine, creatine, lutein and zeaxanthin and beta-alanine are reviewed. Specific nutritional strategies for intakes leading up to competitions, post training and competition recovery and nutritional strategies for travel are also addressed.",

This research assessed the sports undergraduates' nutritional intake compared to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and nutrition goals provided by WHO. This study is a quantitative, cross-sectional descriptive study. One hundred and one (n = 101) sports undergraduates aged between 20 to 23 years were recruited and the nutrient intake was assessed using the three-day food diary method and quantified the macro and micronutrients by the food composition database. One sample t-test was performed to compare the mean nutrient intakes with the lowest recommendation values. Though most undergraduates were able to meet the dietary requirements in carbohydrates, they were deficient in their protein intake and exceeded in fats intake. Further, both male and female students were deficient in their daily energy intake (1723 kcal, 1607 kcal) and dietary fiber intake (8 g, 11 g). The saturated fat intake was met by all students while 20% of males and 21% of females exceeded the recommendations (< 10%). The micronutrient intake of vitamins such as C, B1, B2, B9, and B12 and minerals such as Calcium, Magnesium, and Potassium, were significantly below the recommendations (p < 0.05) except for vitamin B3 niacin. Providing a nutritionally valuable meal is essentially required to maintain both physical and mental fitness. Our results revealed that the Sri Lankan sport science undergraduates do not have an adequate daily dietary intake of energy, proteins, calcium, magnesium, potassium, and vitamins such as C, B1, B2, B9, and B12.",

    "abstract": "Triathlon is a physically demanding sport, requiring athletes to make informed decisions regarding their daily food and fluid intake to align with daily training. With an increase in uptake for online learning, remotely delivered education programs offer an opportunity to improve nutritional knowledge and subsequent dietary intake in athletes. This single-arm observational study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a remotely delivered nutrition education program on sports nutrition knowledge and the dietary intake of junior elite triathletes (n = 21; female n = 9; male n = 12; 18.9 ± 1.6 y). A total of 18 participants completed dietary intake assessments (4-day food diary via Easy Diet DiaryTM) and 14 participants completed an 83-question sports nutrition knowledge assessment (Sports Nutrition Knowledge Questionnaire (SNKQ)) before and after the 8-week program. Sports nutrition knowledge scores improved by 15% (p < 0.001, ES = 0.9) following the program. Male participants reported higher energy intakes before (3348 kJ, 95% CI: 117−6579; p = 0.043) and after (3644 kJ, 95% CI: 451−6836; p = 0.028) the program compared to females. Carbohydrate intake at breakfast (p = 0.022), daily intakes of fruit (p = 0.033), dairy (p = 0.01) and calcium (p = 0.029) increased following nutrition education. Irrespective of gender, participants had higher intakes of energy (p < 0.001), carbohydrate (p = 0.001), protein (p = 0.007), and fat (p = 0.007) on heavy training days compared to lighter training days before and after the program with total nutrition knowledge scores negatively correlated with discretionary food intake (r = −0.695, p = 0.001). A remotely delivered nutrition education program by an accredited sports nutrition professional improved sports nutrition knowledge and subsequent dietary intake of junior elite triathletes, suggesting remote delivery of nutrition education may prove effective when social distancing requirements prevent face-to-face opportunities.",

    "abstract": "Nutritional practices and body composition of para-athletes can impact their health and athletic performance. There is a paucity of research on the nutritional practices, including dietary and supplement intake, body composition and bone health of spinal cord-injured (SCI) endurance hand cyclists. This study assessed the body composition and dietary and supplement intake of 12 national-level SCI endurance hand cyclists (age: 44.0 ± 9.3 years). Bone mineral density (BMD) was assessed in a sub-sample of participants (n = 4) using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Estimated body fat percentage was healthy (18.4 ± 5.1%) and lumbar spine BMD for the sub-sample was adequate, however hip BMD was low (Z-score and/or T-scores < −2). Carbohydrate intake for male and female participants was below the recommended intake (3.8 (2.9−4.1) and 2.4 (2.0−2.7) g/kg BW, respectively). Overall protein intake was adequate, whilst fat intake was high for both males and females (39.7 (37.7−41.6) and 42.1 (39.0−45.3)% of total energy, respectively). The reported intakes for a few key micronutrients were also below the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) and/or adequate intake (AI) for males (vitamin D, calcium). The prevalence of supplement use before, during, and after training was 40%, 100%, and 60%, respectively. In conclusion, the hand cyclists could benefit from nutritional guidance to match their daily carbohydrate intake with exercise requirements and optimise their fat intake. Optimal vitamin D and calcium intake is also important especially in the light of poor bone health below the lesion level.",

Middle gluteal muscle biopsies were collected before and after the feeding trial for immunohistochemical determination of fiber type, and RNA and protein isolation. After 30 d, CB increased (P < 0.05) the percentage of type IIA fibers and tended (P = 0.13) to reduce the numbers of type IIX fibers in comparison to control (CON). No changes (P > 0.05) in type I, IIA, or IIX fiber size were observed in response to CB. No differences (P > 0.05) were noted in the abundance of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) protein or activity between horses receiving CB or CON. Myogenin mRNA abundance was unaffected (P > 0.05) by 30 d of CB supplementation. The increase in type IIA fibers in the absence of altered mitochondrial SDH enzymatic activity suggests that CB affects myosin ATPase expression independent of altered metabolism. The largest tissue in the body, skeletal muscle, is a heterogeneous mix of fibers that are categorized based on their primary source of energy production and speed of contraction. Evidence suggests that Thoroughbred horses with a greater percentage of type IIA, fast-twitch, oxidative fibers are more successful than those with fewer. Pigs fed a diet supplemented with butyrate contained a greater percentage of oxidative muscle fibers. This study examined the ability of calcium butyrate (CB), a short-chain fatty acid, to alter muscle fiber composition in horses. Adult Thoroughbred geldings were supplemented with a placebo or CB for 30 d, and gluteus medius muscle biopsies were retrieved and analyzed for fiber type, myogenin expression, and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity. Results demonstrate a small increase in the percentage of type IIA fibers without a change in SDH activity, a marker of oxidative metabolism. Myogenin expression remained unaffected by CB supplementation. These efforts underscore the need for further research to validate improved exercise performance in response to CB supplementation and identify a mechanism of action for the fatty acid in the equine skeletal muscle.",

    "title": "Foraging for the Optimal Dressing Scaffold to Carry Adipose-Derived Stromal/Progenitor Cells for Cell Therapy.",
    "abstract": "In our daily plastic surgery practice, we have seen many chronic wounds that need new biotechnology to help and improve wound healing. Stem cells play a crucial role in regenerative medicine. Many pre-clinical researches had reported the beneficial paracrine effects of stem cell therapy for chronic wounds. Cell-friendly scaffolds may provide the protection and three-dimensional space required for adherence of stem cells, thus allowing these stem cells to proliferate and differentiate for treatment purpose. A successful scaffold may enhance the effects of stem cell therapy. In this presented series, the authors attempted to identify the most suitable scaffolds from several commercially available wound dressings that could sustain adipose-derived stromal/progenitor cells (ADSCs) survival. Therefore, we isolated ADSCs containing the green fluorescent protein (GFP) from GFP transgenic rats. The GFP (+) ADSCs and their progenies could be easily observed using a fluorescence microscope. Moreover, we analyzed the cytokines secreted in condition medium (CM) to understand the activities of ADSCs in various dressings. Our results showed that the foam dressings, hydrofiber, chitosan, and alginate plus carboxymethylcellulose were identified as the most suitable dressing materials. Higher concentrations of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were observed 48 h after loading them with GFP (+) ADSCs. Therefore, multiple topical cell therapy using ADSCs can be performed by applying suitable dressing scaffolds without repeated needle injections to deliver the stem cells into the wound bed. Based on their fluorescence property, the GFP (+) ADSCs can also possibly be used for testing biocompatibility of medical materials in the future.",

    "abstract": "This position stand aims to provide an evidence-based summary of the energy and nutritional demands of tactical athletes to promote optimal health and performance while keeping in mind the unique challenges faced due to work schedules, job demands, and austere environments. After a critical analysis of the literature, the following nutritional guidelines represent the position of the International Society of Sports Nutrition (ISSN). Nutritional considerations should include the provision and timing of adequate calories, macronutrients, and fluid to meet daily needs as well as strategic nutritional supplementation to improve physical, cognitive, and occupational performance outcomes; reduce risk of injury, obesity, and cardiometabolic disease; reduce the potential for a fatal mistake; and promote occupational readiness. Energy demands should be met by utilizing the Military Dietary Reference Intakes (MDRIs) established and codified in Army Regulation 40-25. Although research is somewhat limited, military personnel may also benefit from caffeine, creatine monohydrate, essential amino acids, protein, omega-3-fatty acids, beta-alanine, and L-tyrosine supplementation, especially during high-stress conditions. Specific energy needs are unknown and may vary depending on occupation-specific tasks. It is likely the general caloric intake and macronutrient guidelines for recreational athletes or the Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Ranges for the general healthy adult population may benefit first responders. Strategies such as implementing wellness policies, setting up supportive food environments, encouraging healthier food systems, and using community resources to offer evidence-based nutrition classes are inexpensive and potentially meaningful ways to improve physical activity and diet habits. The following provides a more detailed overview of the literature and recommendations for these populations.",

    "abstract": "The widespread prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) not only influences patients' daily lives but also has an economic impact on society. Increasing physical activity and a healthy diet can delay the progression of T2D. Although there are evidence-based recommendations on diet and physical activity, patients with T2D have difficulties implementing them. An appropriate lifestyle intervention can address this problem. This study is based on the need to develop an intervention that helps patients to establish behavioural changes in order to achieve glycaemic control. The intervention will be evaluated in a monocentric, open-label, pragmatic, two-arm randomised controlled trial with a sample ratio of 1:1 and a parallel design. This superiority study will be conducted in Switzerland. All enrolled patients (n=90) will receive the standard medical treatment for T2D. The intervention group will receive personal health coaching by telephone and access to a smartphone and web application for 1 year. The control group will receive access to the application for 1 year and a one-time written diet and exercise recommendation. The primary outcomes are objectively measured physical activity and glycated haemoglobin. Secondary outcomes are self-reported physical activity, nutrition, cognitive mediators of changes in sport-related behaviour, blood values, medication and nutritional supplements, anthropometric data, quality of life, neuropathy and cost-effectiveness. All outcomes will be measured at baseline, at 27 weeks after inclusion and at 54 weeks after inclusion. The recruitment of participants and the measurements will be completed after 2 years. Linear mixed-effects models will be applied for each outcome variable to analyse the intervention effects. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee North-western and Central Switzerland in February 2021 (ref: 2020-02755). All participants will be required to provide written informed consent. The results will be published in international peer-reviewed journals. ISRCTN79457541.",

    "abstract": "Approximately 20% of older people are readmitted to the hospital within 30 days of discharge. Even a short hospital stay decreases the ability to cope with the activities of daily living. The aims of this study were to (1) assess the feasibility of recruitment, (2) assess the acceptability of the intervention, and (3) investigate if an individual nutritional intervention could reduce the readmission rate of geriatric patients within 30 days of being discharged to their own homes. The unblinded, randomized, controlled pilot trial includes geriatric patients discharged to their own homes. Forty patients were recruited from a medical ward and randomized to standard treatment (n = 19) or individualized nutritional intervention (n = 21). The intervention was dietary counseling and a nutrition plan before discharge, combined with two home visits performed by an educated nutritionist over a period of 4 weeks. Outcomes were readmission (primary), mortality, protein and energy intake, body weight, activity of daily living, handgrip strength, number of chair stands, and quality of life. Intention-to-treat analysis, per-protocol analysis, and post hoc analysis of readmissions were carried out. Recruitment was feasible, and there was high compliance to the intervention. There was no difference in readmission between the intervention group and control group 30 days after discharge (29% vs 11%). The individual nutritional intervention had a positive impact on achieving 75% of energy requirements at 30 days for the intervention group compared to the control group (93% vs 47%, p = 0.01). No other differences were found between the groups. The individual nutritional intervention did not prevent readmission among geriatric patients in this trial. Recruitment procedures functioned well, and the intervention was well accepted by the patients. ClinicalTrial.gov, NCT03519139 . Retrospectively registered on 8 May 2018.",

A 24-h recall nutrition survey was conducted on the second day of training and one day of the weekend (holidays) to analyze daily nutritional intake. Dietary information was analyzed using the NQ-A questionnaire, which comprises 21 items. The athletes were divided into three groups based on the NQ-A score (High, Middle, Low). A comparative analysis of dietary intake of disabled athletes with the recommended dietary intake amount (RDA) was performed. The intake of carbohydrates (166.9%), proteins (112.3%), vitamin E (112.0%), thiamine (124.6%), riboflavin (100.2%), vitamin B6 (110.6%), vitamin B12 (120.7%), sodium (216.6%), phosphorus (118.3%), iron (146.5%), iodine (143.2%), and selenium (114.2%) was higher than the Korean-recommended amount. In particular, as the results of comparing dietary intake between the three groups showed, the low NQ-A score group had significantly lower intake compared to the %RDA for vitamin E (67.1%), C (26.3%), and Potassium (42.8%). However, with most nutrients, nutritional intake deficiency was not shown to be a problem.",

    "abstract": "The metabolic perturbations caused by competitive rugby are not well characterized. Our aim is to utilize untargeted metabolomics to develop appropriate interventions, based on the metabolic fluctuations that occur in response to this collision-based team sport. Seven members of an English Premiership rugby squad consented to provide blood, urine, and saliva samples daily, over a competitive week including gameday (GD), with physical demands and dietary intake also recorded. Sample collection, processing and statistical analysis were performed in accordance with best practice set out by the metabolomics standards initiative employing 700 MHz NMR spectroscopy. Univariate and multivariate statistical analysis were employed to reveal the acute energy needs of this high intensity sport are met via glycolysis, the TCA cycle and gluconeogenesis. The recovery period after cessation of match play and prior to training recommencing sees a re-entry to gluconeogenesis, coupled with markers of oxidative stress, structural protein degradation, and reduced fatty acid metabolism. This novel insight leads us to propose that effective recovery from muscle damaging collisions is dependent upon the availability of glucose. An adjustment in the periodisation of carbohydrate to increase GD+1 provision may prevent the oxidation of amino acids which may also be crucial to allay markers of structural tissue degradation. Should we expand the 'Fuel for the work required' paradigm in collision-based team sports to include 'Fuel for the damage induced'?",

    "title": "Physical Activity and Health in Chronic Kidney Disease.",
    "abstract": "Clinical Background and Epidemiology: Low physical activity is a common phenotype in individuals living with chronic kidney disease (CKD). It increases as renal function declines and is associated with adverse clinical outcomes and a poor quality of life (QOL). Both behavioral and disease-related factors contribute to the low physical activity levels in CKD. CKD has profound negative effects on skeletal muscle structure and function that are related to impairments in mitochondrial function, inflammation, oxidative stress, metabolic acidosis, and other uremia-related factors. These factors promote muscle protein catabolism and wasting, and impair strength, physical performance, and cardiorespiratory fitness. Moreover, the high burden of comorbid disease contributes to patient fatigue, fear of injury, and poor exercise self-efficacy. All of these factors reinforce patient's sedentary behavior, leading to a vicious cycle of disease and disability that further compromises their health and QOL. Data from both observational studies and exercise interventions indicate that increasing levels of physical activity may provide a range of benefits in CKD patients, including attenuating declines in renal function, and improving markers of physical function, cardiovascular disease risk, and QOL. Unfortunately, these results have not led to widespread implementation of exercise programs in CKD, and physical inactivity and poor physical function remain hallmarks of the disease worldwide. Challenges and Solutions: There are many frequently cited barriers to implementing exercise programs in CKD. These include: a lack of training and knowledge about physical activity/exercise prescriptions and interventions among health professionals; inadequate time to implement exercise programs due to other clinical responsibilities; a lack of specific funding and incentives to develop these programs; and a poor quality of the data demonstrating efficacy of exercise. Many CKD patients also are unmotivated to incorporate exercise into their daily lives due to time constraints, depression, and other comorbid diseases, and poor self-efficacy for exercise. Given these barriers, it is not surprising that physical activity/exercise programs have not become a component of standard of care for CKD patients. We discuss several potential solutions to address these barriers, including: (1) providing better education and training for healthcare professionals who provide exercise advise and counselling to individuals with CKD; (2) providing incentives to reimburse payers to develop and maintain exercise programs in CKD; and (3) providing more personalized approaches to exercise prescription and implementation of exercise programs that consider the unique circumstances of individual CKD patients. In summary, low physical activity levels in CKD patients result from a combination of many factors that adversely impact patient's health and QOL. Addressing this problem will require comprehensive intervention strategies that consider both the unique pathophysiology of CKD and the individual circumstances of those living with the disease.",

    "title": "Toward the development of a vibrant, super-aged society: The future of medicine and society in Japan.",
    "abstract": "As Japan's population continues to age, it is estimated that the number of people aged ≥75 years will exceed 20 million by 2025. Furthermore, over the past 10 years, we have not reduced the difference between life expectancy and healthy life expectancy. Therefore, the extension of healthy life expectancy and the development of a healthy society are the most urgent issues. In terms of medical care, the changing times have inevitably led to changes in disease structures and medical demands; therefore, the medical delivery system has had to be changed to meet these demands. As dementia rapidly increases, it is important to address \"frailty,\" a condition in which people become more vulnerable to environmental factors as they age, and there is a need to provide services to older people, particularly the old-old, that emphasize quality of life in addition to medical care. To realize a super-aged society that will remain vigorous and vibrant for many years, we need to rethink the future of Japanese medicine and healthcare, and the state of society. Disparity between healthy life expectancy and average life expectancy in the realization of a healthy society It is a challenge to build a society with a long and healthy life expectancy through comprehensive prevention and management of lifestyle-related diseases, as well as the elucidation of the factors that explain sex differences in healthy life expectancy, based on the recognition that lifestyle-related diseases in midlife are risk factors for frailty and dementia in old age. Challenges in medical care for building a super-aged and healthy society The challenges include promoting clinical guidelines suitable for older people, including lifestyle-related disease management, promoting comprehensive research on aging (basic research, clinical research and community collaboration research), and embodying a paradigm shift from \"cure-seeking medical care\" to \"cure- and support-seeking medical care.\" Furthermore, the key to the future of integrated community care is the development of a comprehensive medical care system for older people in each region and the development of the next generation of medical personnel. Dissemination of frailty prevention measures in a super-aged society The concept of frailty encompasses the meaning of multifacetedness and reversibility; therefore, a comprehensive approach is required, including the renewal of conventional prevention activities in each region, such as the nutritional status of older people, physical activity including exercise, and various opportunities for social participation and participation conditions. Challenges of an unstable diet and undernutrition in older people According to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey of Japan, energy and protein intakes are low in Japanese people aged ≥75 years; particularly in people aged ≥80 years, low and insufficient intake of nutrients are prominent. Undernutrition in older people is increasing and is more pronounced in women. There are multiple factors behind this, including social factors, such as living alone, eating alone, poverty and other social factors, as well as problems with access to food security. Pharmacotherapy for older people: measures against polypharmacy In addition to the problems of adverse drug events, drug interactions, duplication of effects and the presence of drugs that \"require particularly careful administration,\" it is also necessary to take measures against polypharmacy in older people, as well as medical economic issues, such as high drug costs and large amounts of remaining drugs. Barriers to this measure include multiple medical institution visits for each disease, lack of coordination between professions, and lack of understanding by patients and families. Role of local communities in a healthy society The decline in the working-age population is also a major challenge; however, we need to make a shift to use this declining birthrate and aging population as an opportunity rather than a crisis. As we look ahead to the coming of the 100-year age of life, we rethink the creation of a comprehensive society and community, and aim to create an age-free society where everyone can play an active role and live in peace, regardless of age. In this report, we have put together a vision for the future of an aging Japanese society from a broader perspective of how the environment and local communities should be, rather than simply from the perspective of individual health. We aim to convey this proposal to the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, the Cabinet Office, and various professional organizations. The paradigm shift from \"cure-seeking medical care\" to \"cure- and support-seeking medical care\" should be promoted for the development of a healthy society While further promoting pre-emptive medical care in the medical care for older people, the development of multidisciplinary medical guidelines appropriate for older people should be promoted at the same time. In addition, we should promote basic aging research, clinical research (including the long-term care field) and transitional research that cover regional areas. Furthermore, while promoting the paradigm shift from \"cure-seeking medical care\" to \"cure- and support-seeking medical care,\" the development of various comprehensive medical treatment systems for older people and the strengthening of integrated community care systems should be promoted. Development of the next generation of medical personnel to comprehensively deal with geriatric care, including training geriatric specialists, should be promoted As the number of older people with multimorbidities and frailty rapidly increases in the future, we should promote the development of the next generation of medical personnel who can comprehensively handle medical care for older people, including training leading geriatricians in cooperation with multiple professions in the integrated community care system to provide sufficient medical care. Countermeasures for frailty in older people should be promoted from medical and community planning perspectives To address frailty, which requires comprehensive evaluation and intervention, the three pillars of frailty prevention (nutrition, exercise and social participation) should be incorporated and addressed as part of community development within each municipality, taking into account local characteristics. In particular, it is necessary to revise the way of thinking about nutrition management in older people and the guidelines of the societies in the field. In addition, it is important to strengthen industry-academia-government-private partnerships in each region, taking into account not only medical issues, but also social factors, and encourage the development of momentum in the entire region regarding measures against undernutrition in older people. Polypharmacy measures should be promoted in pharmacotherapy for older people It is necessary to promote cooperation between physicians and pharmacists, establish other multiprofessional cooperation systems, and develop medical and long-term care insurance systems to support this. It is also essential to change the public's mindset, and awareness-raising activities at all levels are required, including the enhancement of educational materials for medical caregivers and the general public. In addition, the economic impact of healthcare using big data should be timely clarified. Innovation in medical and urban planning perspectives should be promoted In the future, it will be necessary to modify and update multidisciplinary approaches such as social participation (e.g. participation in a salon) with a view to innovation in both medical care and community development, especially on the idea of a symbiotic community. In addition, industry-academia-government-private partnership is necessary, including all aforementioned, such as places where people can play an active role in the rest of their lives (such as employment), promotion of human connections, promotion of technology to support older people and support for daily life.

    "abstract": "Clinical data are lacking regarding the risk of viral transmission from individuals who have positive reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) SARS-CoV-2 test results after recovery from COVID-19. To describe case characteristics, including viral dynamics and transmission of infection, for individuals who have clinically recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection but continued to have positive test results following discontinuation of isolation precautions. This retrospective cohort study used data collected from June 11, 2020, to October 19, 2020, as part of the National Basketball Association (NBA) closed campus occupational health program in Orlando, Florida, which required daily RT-PCR testing and ad hoc serological testing for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. Nearly 4000 NBA players, staff, and vendors participated in the NBA's regular and postseason occupational health program in Orlando. Persistent positive cases were those who recovered from a documented SARS-CoV-2 infection, satisfied US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria for discontinuation of isolation precautions, and had at least 1 postinfection positive RT-PCR test(s) result. Person-days of participation in indoor, unmasked activities that involved direct exposure between persistent positive cases and noninfected individuals. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 following interaction with persistent positive individuals, as measured by the number of new COVID-19 cases in the Orlando campus program. Among 3648 individuals who participated, 36 (1%) were persistent positive cases, most of whom were younger than 30 years (24 [67%]) and male (34 [94%]). Antibodies were detected in 33 individuals (91.7%); all remained asymptomatic following the index persistent positive RT-PCR result. Cycle threshold values for persistent positive RT-PCR test results were typically above the Roche cobas SARS-CoV-2 limit of detection. Cases were monitored for up to 100 days (mean [SD], 51 [23.9] days), during which there were at least 1480 person-days of direct exposure activities, with no transmission events or secondary infections of SARS-CoV-2 detected (0 new cases). In this retrospective cohort study of the 2020 NBA closed campus occupational health program, recovered individuals who continued to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 following discontinuation of isolation were not infectious to others. These findings support time-based US Centers of Disease Control and Prevention recommendations for ending isolation.",

    "abstract": "In this brief report, we describe the safety of reopening US Olympic and Paralympic Training facilities (USOPTFs) during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic from July 2020 through October 2020. We evaluated the prevalence of COVID-19 infection at the time of reentry and cardiopulmonary sequelae of COVID-19 in elite athletes. All athletes returning to a USOPTF were required to go through a reentry protocol consisting of an electronic health history, a 6-day quarantine including twice-daily symptom surveys, COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction and antibody testing, physical examination, 12-lead electrocardiogram, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I, and pulmonary function testing. Athletes with current or prior COVID-19 infection also underwent an echocardiogram, cardiology consultation, and additional testing as indicated. All athletes followed rigorous infection prevention measures and minimized contact with the outside community following reentry. At the time of this report, 301 athletes completed the reentry protocol among which 14 (4.7%) tested positive for active (positive polymerase chain reaction test, n = 3) or prior (positive antibody test, n = 11) COVID-19 infection. During the study period, this cohort accrued 14,916 days living and training at USOPTFs. Only one (0.3%) athlete was subsequently diagnosed with a new COVID-19 infection. No cardiopulmonary pathology attributable to COVID-19 was detected. Our findings suggest that residential elite athlete training facilities can successfully resume activity during the COVID-19 pandemic when strict reentry and infection prevention measures are followed. Dissemination of our reentry quarantine and screening protocols with COVID-19 mitigation measures may assist the global sports and medical community develop best practices for reopening of similar training centers.",

    "title": "The Mediterranean Athlete's Nutrition: Are Protein Supplements Necessary?",
    "abstract": "(1) Background: It is recommended that an athlete, in order to ensure correct nutrition and performance, should consume between 1.2 and 2.0 g/kg/day of protein, while the daily recommended protein intake for a non-athlete is 0.8and 0.9 mg/kg/day. It is unclear if athletes living in Mediterranean countries are able to meet protein requirements without supplementation, since Mediterranean diet de-emphasizes meat and meat products. (2) Methods: 166 athletes (125 males) enrolled between 2017 and 2019 were required to keep a dietary journal for three consecutive days (2 workdays and 1 weekend day). Athletes had to be >18 years old, train in a particular sport activity more than 3 h a week and compete at least at an amateur level. Journal data were collected and then translated into macro-nutrient content (grams of protein, carbohydrates, and lipids) by a nutritionist. (3) Results: The protein intake reported by this specific population vary slightly from the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (AND), Dietitians of Canada (DC), and the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) joint statement recommendation level. Average protein levels without protein supplementation fell within the protein guidelines. Counterintuitively, the intake among those who supplemented their diet with protein was higher compared with those who did not, even when excluding the contribution of supplements. Although the majority of subjects participating in the study were able to meet protein intake recommended for athletes without protein supplementation, 27% of athletes were below the guideline range. (4) Conclusions: these data suggest that athletes' nutrition should be more often evaluated by a nutritionist and that they will benefit from increasing their nutritional knowledge in order to make better food choices, resorting to protein supplementation only when effectively needed.",

    "abstract": "Football is a global game which is constantly evolving, showing substantial increases in physical and technical demands. Nutrition plays a valuable integrated role in optimising performance of elite players during training and match-play, and maintaining their overall health throughout the season. An evidence-based approach to nutrition emphasising, a 'food first' philosophy (ie, food over supplements), is fundamental to ensure effective player support. This requires relevant scientific evidence to be applied according to the constraints of what is practical and feasible in the football setting. The science underpinning sports nutrition is evolving fast, and practitioners must be alert to new developments. In response to these developments, the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) has gathered experts in applied sports nutrition research as well as practitioners working with elite football clubs and national associations/federations to issue an expert statement on a range of topics relevant to elite football nutrition: (1) match day nutrition, (2) training day nutrition, (3) body composition, (4) stressful environments and travel, (5) cultural diversity and dietary considerations, (6) dietary supplements, (7) rehabilitation, (8) referees and (9) junior high-level players. The expert group provide a narrative synthesis of the scientific background relating to these topics based on their knowledge and experience of the scientific research literature, as well as practical experience of applying knowledge within an elite sports setting. Our intention is to provide readers with content to help drive their own practical recommendations. In addition, to provide guidance to applied researchers where to focus future efforts.",

    "abstract": "Excess fat mass (FM) contributes to poor prostate cancer (PCa) prognosis and comorbidity. However, FM gain is a common side effect of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). We examined the efficacy of a 12-wk weight loss intervention to reduce FM and maintain lean mass (LM) in ADT-treated obese PCa patients. Fourteen ADT-treated obese PCa patients (72 ± 9 yr, 39.7% ± 5.4% body fat) were recruited for a self-controlled prospective study, with 11 completing the 6-wk control period, followed by a 12-wk intervention comprising 300 min·wk-1 of exercise including supervised resistance training and home-based aerobic exercise, and dietitian consultations advising a daily energy deficit (2100-4200 kJ) and protein supplementation. Body composition was assessed by dual x-ray absorptiometry. Secondary outcomes included muscle strength (one-repetition maximum), cardiorespiratory fitness (maximal oxygen consumption), and blood biomarkers. There were no significant changes during the control period. Patients attended 89% of supervised exercise sessions and 100% of dietitian consultations. No changes in physical activity or energy intake were observed. During the intervention, patients experienced significant reductions in weight (-2.8 ± 3.2 kg, P = 0.016), FM (-2.8 ± 2.6 kg, P < 0.001), and trunk FM (-1.8 ± 1.4 kg, P < 0.001), with LM preserved (-0.05 ± 1.6 kg, P = 0.805). Muscle strength (4.6%-24.7%, P < 0.010) and maximal oxygen consumption (3.5 ± 4.7 mL·min-1·kg-1, P = 0.041) significantly improved. Leptin significantly decreased (-2.2 (-2.7 to 0.5) ng·mL-1, P = 0.016) with no other changes in blood biomarkers such as testosterone and lipids (P = 0.051-0.765); however, C-reactive protein (rs = -0.670, P = 0.024) and triglycerides (r = -0.667, P = 0.025) were associated with individual changes in LM. This study shows preliminary efficacy for an exercise and nutrition weight loss intervention to reduce FM, maintain LM, and improve muscle strength and cardiorespiratory fitness in ADT-treated obese PCa patients. The change in body composition may affect blood biomarkers associated with obesity and PCa progression; however, further research is required.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the restart of the German Bundesliga (football (soccer)) during the COVID-19 pandemic from a medical perspective. Participants were male professional football players from the two highest German leagues and the officials working closely with them. Our report covers nine match days spread over 9 weeks (May to July 2020). Daily symptom monitoring, PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 RNA twice weekly, and antibody tests (on two occasions-early during the phase in May 2020 and in the week of the last match) were conducted. Target variables were: (1) onset of typical COVID-19 symptoms, (2) positive PCR results, and (3) IgG seroconversion against SARS-CoV-2. All detected seroconversions were controlled by neutralisation tests. Suspicious symptoms were reported for one player; an immediate additional PCR test as well as all subsequent diagnostic and antibody tests proved negative for coronavirus. Of 1702 regularly tested individuals (1079 players, 623 officials members), 8 players and 4 officials tested positive during one of the first rounds of PCR testing prior to the onset of team training, 2 players during the third round. No further positive results occurred during the remainder of the season. 694 players and 291 officials provided two serum samples for antibody testing. Nine players converted from negative/borderline to positive (without symptoms); two players who initially tested positive tested negative at the end of the season. 22 players remained seropositive throughout the season. None of the seroconversions was confirmed in the neutralisation test. Professional football training and matches can be carried out safely during the COVID-19 pandemic. This requires strict hygiene measures including regular PCR testing.",

    "title": "The kappa opioid receptor antagonist aticaprant reverses behavioral effects from unpredictable chronic mild stress in male mice.",
    "abstract": "Major depressive disorder is a leading cause of disability worldwide and is likely precipitated by chronic stress. Although many antidepressants are currently available, these drugs require weeks to months of daily administration before reduction of symptoms occurs and many patients remain treatment-resistant despite several courses of treatment. There is a pressing need for new treatments for stress-related disorders. Kappa opioid receptors (KORs) are a promising new therapeutic target for major depressive disorder and anhedonia because acute KOR blockade prevents many effects of stress in rodents. The following study assessed whether repeated treatment with the selective KOR antagonist aticaprant (also known as JNJ-67953964, and previously LY-2456302 and CERC-501) was effective in reversing behaviors in rodents following exposure to unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS). Adult male C57BL/6J mice were exposed to 4 weeks of UCMS. After 3 weeks of stress, aticaprant (10 mg/kg) was administered daily for 11 treatments. Behavioral assessments included the sucrose preference test, nesting, forced swim test, hot plate test, light-dark test, and social interaction test. Aticaprant significantly reversed stress-induced deficits produced by UCMS on the SPT, nesting, FST, and hot plate test. The effects of aticaprant persisted through a stress and treatment recovery period. Aticaprant was not effective at reversing behavioral effects caused by stress in the light-dark and social interaction tests. The results support further study of the role of KORs in regulating circuits related to reward, self-care, and cognition when they are disrupted by chronic stress. They are also consistent with the clinical development of aticaprant as a therapeutic for stress-related disorders targeted at anhedonia, such as depression and post-traumatic stress disorder.",

Chest radiograph showed bilateral infiltrates that correlated with multifocal ground glass opacities in a thoracic CT scan (Fig 1). The patient was severely hypoxemic and required intensive care and oxygen administration via a high-flow nasal cannula. On admission, leucocyte counts were 23.3 k/μL; platelet counts were 518 k/μL; hemoglobin level was 12 g/dL; C-reactive protein was 83 mg/L, and procalcitonin was 0.7 μg/L. An auto-antibody panel that included antinuclear antibodies, extractable nuclear antigen (including anti-centromere-antibodies), antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, and myositis- and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor-antibodies was negative, as was the rheumatoid factor. Immunoglobulins that included IgG1-4 and IgA and renal function were normal. Sicca symptoms like xerophthalmia and xerostomia were negated. The patient fully recovered after empiric administration of antibiotics and glucocorticoids (initially 500 mg methylprednisolone daily over 3 days with consecutive tapering).",

    "abstract": "Dedifferentiation of insulin-secreting β cells in the islets of Langerhans has been proposed to be a major mechanism of β-cell dysfunction. Whether dedifferentiated β cells can be targeted by pharmacological intervention for diabetes remission, and ways in which this could be accomplished, are unknown as yet. Here we report the use of streptozotocin-induced diabetes to study β-cell dedifferentiation in mice. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of islets identified markers and pathways associated with β-cell dedifferentiation and dysfunction. Single and combinatorial pharmacology further show that insulin treatment triggers insulin receptor pathway activation in β cells and restores maturation and function for diabetes remission. Additional β-cell selective delivery of oestrogen by Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1-oestrogen conjugate) decreases daily insulin requirements by 60%, triggers oestrogen-specific activation of the endoplasmic-reticulum-associated protein degradation system, and further increases β-cell survival and regeneration. GLP-1-oestrogen also protects human β cells against cytokine-induced dysfunction. This study not only describes mechanisms of β-cell dedifferentiation and regeneration, but also reveals pharmacological entry points to target dedifferentiated β cells for diabetes remission.",

However, little is known about the protein requirements of elite female athletes engaging in team sports. This study aimed to determine the nitrogen balance and distribution of protein and amino acid intake in elite female handball athletes during training camp. In observational study design, 11 female Japanese national handball players (age 26.9 ± 4.9 years) participated in a 5-days experiment. Nitrogen balance was calculated from the daily protein intake assessed by dietary records and urinary nitrogen excretion. Amino acid intake amounts were organized based on six eating occasions. The average and population-safe protein intake for zero nitrogen balance were estimated as 1.57 and 1.93 g/kg/day, respectively. The protein intake at breakfast, lunch, and dinner and the leucine intake in the three main meals and the morning snack were higher than is recommended by current guidelines for maximizing muscle protein synthesis. The population-safe protein intake in elite female handball athletes was within the range of the current recommendations for athletes (1.2-2.0 g/kg/day). Our results show that it may be possible to improve the distribution and quality of protein ingestion after exercise and before sleep.",

    "abstract": "International competition inevitably presents logistical challenges for athletes. Events such as the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games require further consideration given historical climate data suggest athletes will experience significant heat stress. Given the expected climate, athletes face major challenges to health and performance. With this in mind, heat alleviation strategies should be a fundamental consideration. This review provides a focused perspective of the relevant literature describing how practitioners can structure male and female athlete preparations for performance in hot, humid conditions. Whilst scientific literature commonly describes experimental work, with a primary focus on maximizing magnitudes of adaptive responses, this may sacrifice ecological validity, particularly for athletes whom must balance logistical considerations aligned with integrating environmental preparation around training, tapering and travel plans. Additionally, opportunities for sophisticated interventions may not be possible in the constrained environment of the athlete village or event arenas. This review therefore takes knowledge gained from robust experimental work, interprets it and provides direction on how practitioners/coaches can optimize their athletes' heat alleviation strategies. This review identifies two distinct heat alleviation themes that should be considered to form an individualized strategy for the athlete to enhance thermoregulatory/performance physiology. First, chronic heat alleviation techniques are outlined, these describe interventions such as heat acclimation, which are implemented pre, during and post-training to prepare for the increased heat stress. Second, acute heat alleviation techniques that are implemented immediately prior to, and sometimes during the event are discussed. ",

    "abstract": "This meta-analysis investigated whether multi-ingredient protein supplements (MIPS) combined with exercise improve body composition and muscle fitness in women. It also examined how participant characteristics, training protocols, and supplementation strategies might influence these outcomes. A systematic search of five electronic databases was conducted through February 2025 to identify randomized controlled trials evaluating the effects of MIPS combined with exercise training on body composition and muscle-related outcomes in women. A multilevel meta-analysis was performed to pool effect sizes, reported as standardized mean differences (Hedges' g), with heterogeneity assessed through predefined subgroup analyses. Nine randomized controlled trials involving 408 healthy women aged 18 to 73 years were included. The meta-analysis showed that combining MIPS with exercise training led to significant increases in fat-free mass [0.45 kg (0.19 to 0.71),  Combining MIPS with exercise training significantly improves fat-free mass, muscle mass, and strength in women, with no additional benefits for fat-related or functional outcomes. These effects are moderated by age, BMI, supplementation timing, isocaloric designs, and intervention duration, highlighting the importance of individualized strategies. Further high-quality isocaloric design trials in diverse female populations are needed to refine tailored approaches that optimize health and performance. https://osf.io/hkt7p.",

The magnitude of muscle hypertrophy might differ depending on the timing of resistance exercise, but the molecular mechanism remains unclear. We aimed to define whether the time of day when muscles are contracted affects mTOR signaling and muscle protein synthesis. Adult male C57BL/6 J mice were housed under a 12 h/12 h light/dark cycle, and right gastrocnemius muscles were contracted using percutaneous electrical stimulation at 1, 7, 13, or 19 h after lights on. Contractions induced more phosphorylation of downstream targets of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling such as S6K1 and rpS6 during the light (sleep), than the dark (active) phase, while expression of the negative regulator of mTORC1 that regulates development and DNA damage responses 1 (REDD1) was anti-phasic. Basal muscle protein synthesis in the sedentary leg was higher during the light, compared to the dark phase, while contraction-induced synthesis did not significantly vary throughout the day. Muscle hypertrophy is controlled by the balance between protein synthesis and degradation. Therefore, further studies are needed to elucidate the time-of-day effects of resistance exercise on muscle hypertrophy.",

    "abstract": "Maintaining and enhancing skeletal muscle mass and strength are essential for optimizing metabolic function and preventing chronic diseases. Resistance exercise plays a pivotal role in this process by modulating the balance between synthesis and degradation of skeletal muscle protein. While the efficacy of such exercise in stimulating these processes is well established, uncertainties persist regarding the fibre-type specificity and contraction mode-dependent regulation of key signalling pathways, including mTORC1, AMPK, and the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Furthermore, the interplay between metabolic stressors-such as biopsy timing, muscle damage, inflammation, and oxidative stress-and skeletal muscle adaptation remains insufficiently characterized, posing challenges to mechanistic research. To address these gaps, this review systematically synthesizes current evidence on fibre-specific and contraction mode-specific regulation of skeletal muscle protein turnover. We critically examine the influence of these factors on major signalling pathways and muscle adaptation, identifying key areas of uncertainty and methodological limitations in existing studies. Based on these insights, we propose a novel theoretical framework and predictive model to guide future investigations. By providing a comprehensive and mechanistically driven analysis, this review advances the understanding of resistance exercise-induced muscle adaptations and their physiological implications. Our findings offer valuable insights for optimizing exercise strategies and developing targeted interventions for muscle-related conditions, including sarcopenia, cachexia, and metabolic disorders.",

    "abstract": "Pathological cardiac hypertrophy is an independent risk factor for heart failure (HF). Early identification and timely treatment are crucial for significantly delaying the progression of HF. Targeted amino acid metabolomics and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) were combined to explore the underlying mechanism. In vitro, H9c2 cells were stimulated with angiotensin II (Ang II) or were incubated with extra valine after Ang II stimulation. The branched chain alpha-ketoate dehydrogenase kinase (Bckdk) inhibitor 3,6-dichlorobenzo[b]thiophene-2-carboxylic acid (BT2) and rapamycin were utilized to confirm the role of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway in this process. A significant accumulation of valine was detected within hypertrophic hearts from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). When branched chain amino acid (BCAA) degradation was increased by BT2, the most pronounced decrease was observed in the valine level (Δ = 0.185 μmol/g, p < 0.001), and cardiac hypertrophy was ameliorated. The role of imbalanced mitochondrial quality control (MQC), including the suppression of mitophagy and excessive mitochondrial fission, was revealed in myocardial hypertrophy. In vitro, high concentrations of valine exacerbated cardiomyocyte hypertrophy stimulated by Any II, resulting in the accumulation of impaired mitochondria and respiratory chain dysfunction. BT2, rapamycin, and mitochondrial division inhibitor 1 (Mdivi-1) all ameliorated MQC imbalance, mitochondrial damage and oxidative stress in hypertensive models with high valine concentration. Valine exacerbated pathological cardiac hypertrophy by causing a MQC imbalance, probably as an early biomarker for cardiac hypertrophy under chronic hypertension.",

Muscular weakness and impaired gait may be evident at the moment of diagnosis, serving as defining characteristics of additional muscular dystrophies. Rhabdomyolysis, on the other hand, is a rare presentation Understanding this phenotype is of great importance since it can go unnoticed by physicians, leading to misdiagnosis of metabolic myopathies or delayed diagnosis. We discuss a case of recurrent rhabdomyolysis due to ANO5 muscular dystrophy. A 34-year-old man was referred to our Reference Centre for Hereditary and Metabolic Diseases due to incidentally elevated creatine kinase levels of 4369 U/l (normal value: < 171 U/l) in the context of acute renal colic. He described a 10-year history of progressive myalgia induced by physical activity, particularly in the lower extremities, muscle spasms, and sporadic reddish to brown urine. Although no muscle weakness was detected upon neurological examination, bilateral calf hypertrophy was noted. A comprehensive laboratory analysis was conducted to exclude acquired causes of rhabdomyolysis, including electrolyte abnormalities, endocrine disruptions, and autoimmune myopathies. Considering the high suspicion of an inherited aetiology, we proceeded with next-generation sequencing of rhabdomyolysis-related genes. Genetic testing revealed a c.1180+6t>Cp homozygous mutation in ANO5 gene, which confirmed anoctamin-5 muscular dystrophy. ANO5 muscular dystrophy is a rare cause of inherited rhabdomyolysis. Understanding this phenotype is crucial for accurate and timely diagnosis. Currently, there is no specific treatment for this condition, but management should include avoiding heavy muscle training and use of statins. Anoctamin-5 (ANO5) muscular dystrophy is a rare neuromuscular disease originated by homozygous mutations in ANO5, a gene encoding a protein with the same name located on chromosome 11. ANO5 is a calcium-activated chloride channel that is highly expressed in heart and skeletal muscle. It is a rare cause of inherited rhabdomyolysis. Understanding this phenotype is crucial for accurate and timely diagnosis.We must emphasize how meticulous medical history taking along with a high index of suspicion are essential to diagnose this disease.Currently, there is no specific treatment for this condition, but management should include avoiding heavy muscle training and use of statins.",

    "title": "Effects of Chrono-Exercise and Chrono-Nutrition on Muscle Health: Understanding the Molecular Mechanisms Activated by Timed Exercise and Consumption of Proteins and Carbohydrates.",
    "abstract": "The circadian clock is an endogenous timekeeping system that regulates various physiological and behavioral processes. Recently, it has been shown that the timing of physical activity and food intake can significantly influence metabolic muscle health. Some recent clinical evidence has shown that physical activity practiced in the late afternoon can be more effective in terms of performance and muscle strength. Preclinical studies have highlighted that the explanation for this effect lies in the different daily expression in the muscle of clock genes and clock-controlled genes involved in muscle development and hypertrophy. In conjunction with scientific advances in understanding the molecular mechanisms that regulate circadian rhythms and muscle trophy, chrono-nutrition has gained scientific resonance and has become a promising field, aimed at understanding the regulation of body metabolism. Clinical and preclinical studies have shown that protein consumption at specific circadian time points during the day, or precisely after exercise, can activate signaling pathways involved in muscle protein synthesis and, thus, favor skeletal muscle mass development as well as mitochondrial biogenesis, thereby improving skeletal muscle cell energy production and function. On the other hand, some studies have shown that the consumption of carbohydrates immediately after exercise increases insulin secretion, which facilitates glucose uptake by muscle cells to replenish glycogen. This review summarizes the current scientific literature concerning chrono-exercise and chrono-nutrition and muscle health, focusing on molecular mechanisms involving the circadian regulation of muscle mass, strength, and health. Understanding the intricate molecular relationship between circadian rhythms, exercise, nutrition, and muscle metabolism is essential for optimizing nutritional strategies to prevent or treat muscle wasting. In addition, tailoring protein and carbohydrate intake to timing and individual needs can improve muscle maintenance, growth, and performance.",

    "title": "Targeting Zfp36 to combat cardiac hypertrophy: Insights into ferroptosis pathways.",
    "abstract": "Cardiac hypertrophy is a precursor to heart failure and represents a significant global cause of mortality, thereby necessitating timely and effective therapeutic interventions. Zinc finger protein 36 (Zfp36) is recognised as a critical regulator of ferroptosis; however, its role and underlying mechanisms in cardiac hypertrophy remain largely unexplored. This study aims to investigate the regulatory function of Zfp36 in ferroptosis within the context of cardiac hypertrophy. Single-cell sequencing analysis demonstrated a reduction in Zfp36 expression associated with cardiac hypertrophy. Zfp36 was observed to mitigate ferroptosis and reduce hypertrophic phenotypes in cardiomyocytes subjected to Angiotensin II (Ang II) and in myocardial tissues induced by transverse aortic constriction. The ferroptosis inhibitor Ferrostatin-1 was shown to alleviate hypertrophy when co-incubated with si-Zfp36 and Ang II. Mechanistically, Zfp36 binds to the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of Ythdc2 mRNA, facilitating its degradation. Ythdc2 subsequently binds to SLC7A11 mRNA, enhancing its decay, which leads to a reduction in glutathione (GSH) levels, thereby exacerbating ferroptosis and cardiac hypertrophy. Furthermore, overexpression of Ythdc2 reversed the protective effects conferred by Zfp36, while silencing of Ythdc2 counteracted the effects of Zfp36 knockdown. This study elucidates the role of Zfp36 in cardiac hypertrophy, specifically detailing its modulatory mechanism via the Ythdc2/SLC7A11/GSH ferroptosis pathway. These insights lay the groundwork for innovative approaches to understanding the pathological mechanisms underlying cardiac hypertrophy and enhancing clinical interventions. Zfp36 was initially demonstrated to attenuate cardiac hypertrophy through the inhibition of ferroptosis in cardiomyocytes, providing a new target for therapeutic strategies targeting ferroptosis. Zfp36 facilitated the degradation of Ythdc2 mRNA by binding to it, subsequently inhibiting Ythdc2-mediated degradation of SLC7A11 mRNA, and maintaining GSH levels. This elucidates a previously unrecognized regulatory pathway in the context of cardiac hypertrophy.",

    "title": "GDF10 promotes rodent cardiomyocyte maturation during the postnatal period.",
    "abstract": "Cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts undergo coordinated maturation after birth, and cardiac fibroblasts are required for postnatal cardiomyocyte maturation in mice. Here, we investigate the role of cardiac fibroblast-expressed Growth Differentiation Factor 10 (GDF10) in postnatal heart development. In neonatal mice, Gdf10 is expressed specifically in cardiac fibroblasts, with its highest expression coincident with the onset of cardiomyocyte cell cycle arrest and transition to hypertrophic growth. In neonatal rat ventricular myocyte (NRVM) cultures, GDF10 treatment promotes cardiomyocyte maturation indicated by increased binucleation, downregulation of cell cycle progression genes, and upregulation of cell cycle inhibitor genes. GDF10 treatment leads to an increase in cardiomyocyte cell size, together with increased expression of mature sarcomeric protein isoforms and decreased expression of fetal cardiac genes. RNAsequencing of GDF10-treated NRVM shows an increase in the expression of genes related to myocardial maturation, including upregulation of sodium and potassium channel genes. In vivo, loss of Gdf10 leads to a delay in myocardial maturation indicated by decreased cardiomyocyte cell size and binucleation, as well as increased mitotic activity, at postnatal (P) day 7. Further, induction of mature sarcomeric protein isoform gene expression is delayed, and expression of cell cycle progression genes is prolonged. However, by P10, indicators of cardiomyocyte maturation and mitotic activity are normalized in Gdf10-null hearts relative to controls. Together, these results implicate GDF10 as a novel crosstalk mediator between cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts, which is required for appropriate timing of cardiomyocyte maturation steps including binucleation, hypertrophy, mature sarcomeric isoform gene expression, and cell cycle arrest in the postnatal period.",

    "title": "Siblings With Berardinelli-Seip Congenital Lipodystrophy: Clinical Insights and Challenges.",
    "abstract": "Berardinelli-Seip congenital lipodystrophy (BSCL), also known as congenital generalized lipodystrophy (CGL), is an exceptionally rare autosomal recessive disorder marked by a significant deficiency of adipose tissue throughout the body. This lack of adipose tissue, normally found beneath the skin and between internal organs, leads to impaired adipocyte formation and fat storage, causing lipids to accumulate in atypical tissues such as muscles and the liver. The extent of adipose tissue loss directly influences the severity of symptoms, which can include a muscular appearance, increased appetite, bone cysts, marrow fat depletion, acromegalic features, severe insulin resistance, skeletal muscle hypertrophy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, hepatic steatosis, hepatomegaly, cirrhosis, and intellectual disability. We present a case series of two siblings with BSCL: a nine-year-old boy and his seven-year-old sister, each with unique manifestations of the disorder. The older sibling presented with high-grade fever and right ankle pain, possibly indicative of a calcified deposit, alongside complications such as hyperglycemia (managed without insulin) and moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) with tricuspid regurgitation (TR). The younger sibling displayed similar metabolic and cardiovascular complications, including hepatomegaly and early signs of cardiac involvement. Both cases required comprehensive evaluations, revealing anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated leukocyte count, and high C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. The children were managed with high-potency antibiotics, leading to a marked improvement in their overall conditions. These cases demonstrate the broad spectrum of clinical manifestations associated with BSCL and highlight the importance of a multidisciplinary approach for effective management. Although limited by the small sample size, this case series shows the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in addressing the complex and overlapping symptoms of BSCL, which often mimic more common conditions. Increased awareness among healthcare providers is crucial for ensuring timely diagnosis and appropriate intervention, particularly in pediatric patients.",

    "title": "Effects of thermal interventions on skeletal muscle adaptations and regeneration: perspectives on epigenetics: a narrative review.",
    "abstract": "Recovery methods, such as thermal interventions, have been developed to promote optimal recovery and maximize long-term training adaptations. However, the beneficial effects of these recovery strategies remain a source of controversy. This narrative review aims to provide a detailed understanding of how cold and heat interventions impact long-term training adaptations. Emphasis is placed on skeletal muscle adaptations, particularly the involvement of signaling pathways regulating protein turnover, ribosome and mitochondrial biogenesis, as well as the critical role of satellite cells in promoting myofiber regeneration following atrophy. The current literature suggests that cold interventions can blunt molecular adaptations (e.g., protein synthesis and satellite cell activation) and oxi-inflammatory responses after resistance exercise, resulting in diminished exercise-induced hypertrophy and lower gains in isometric strength during training protocols. Conversely, heat interventions appear promising for mitigating skeletal muscle degradation during immobilization and atrophy. Indeed, heat treatments (e.g., passive interventions such as sauna-bathing or diathermy) can enhance protein turnover and improve the maintenance of muscle mass in atrophic conditions, although their effects on uninjured skeletal muscles in both humans and rodents remain controversial. Nonetheless, heat treatment may serve as an important tool for attenuating atrophy and preserving mitochondrial function in immobilized or injured athletes. Finally, the potential interplay between exercise, thermal interventions and epigenetics is discussed. Future studies must be encouraged to clarify how repeated thermal interventions (heat and cold) affect long-term exercise training adaptations and to determine the optimal modalities (i.e., method of application, temperature, duration, relative humidity, and timing).",

    "abstract": "Intramuscular injection of botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNT-A) is commonly used to improve or maintain the joint range of motion in young children with spasticity. However, the effectiveness of BoNT-A treatment is variable and movement limitations are recurrent. Here we show long-term effects of a single, bilateral abobotulinumtoxinA (aboBoNT-A) injection in the gastrocnemius medialis and soleus muscles of wild-type and spastic (B6.Cg-Glrbspa/J with a mutation in the glycine receptor) mice at a young age (6-7 days). Specifically, we evaluated the impact of aboBoNT-A-A on gait, physical performance, and spontaneous physical behavior, as well as on contractile force characteristics, morphology, and histological phenotype of soleus and gastrocnemius muscles by comparing their results to those of saline-injected controls up to 9 weeks after the injection. The detailed time course of the study specifies the timing of the aboBoNT-A injection at 1 week, the period of behavioral studies from 4-9 weeks, and the age of the mice (10 weeks) at the time of contractile force characteristics and histology assessments. In spastic mice, aboBoNT-A injection had a minor and very specific effect on physical performance, by only modestly increasing stride length as a function of age. aboBoNT-A injection caused a reduction in the force-generating capacity and a slightly smaller physiological cross-sectional area in gastrocnemius medialis, but not in soleus. Reduced physiological cross-sectional area in aboBoNT-A-injected muscles was due to a lower number of muscle fibers, rather than reduced muscle fiber cross-sectional area. The percentage of slow-type muscle fibers and mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase activity were increased, which was associated with an improved muscle endurance capacity. In conclusion, aboBoNT-A injection reduced the number of muscle fibers, causing muscle hypertrophy in remaining fibers and a shift towards more oxidative fibers, resulting in an improved endurance capacity and gait. This study proposed potential cellular mechanisms for the therapeutic efficacy of aboBoNT-A in spasticity.",

    "title": "Differential roles of eosinophils in cardiovascular disease.",
    "abstract": "Eosinophils are essential innate immune cells in allergic responses. Accumulating evidence indicates that eosinophils also participate in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). In clinical studies, high blood eosinophil counts and eosinophil cationic protein levels have been associated with an increased risk of CVD, including myocardial infarction (MI), cardiac hypertrophy, atrial fibrillation, abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and atherosclerosis. However, low blood eosinophil counts have also been reported to be a risk factor for MI, heart failure, aortic dissection, AAA, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism and ischaemic stroke. Although these conflicting clinical observations remain unexplained, CVD status, timing of eosinophil data collection, and tissue eosinophil phenotypic and functional heterogeneities might account for these discrepancies. Preclinical studies suggest that eosinophils have protective actions in MI, cardiac hypertrophy, heart failure and AAA. By contrast, cationic proteins and platelet-activating factor from eosinophils have been shown to promote vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation, vascular calcification, thrombomodulin inactivation and platelet activation and aggregation, thereby exacerbating atherosclerosis, atrial fibrillation, thrombosis and associated complications. Therefore, eosinophils seem to promote calcification and thrombosis in chronic CVD but are protective in acute cardiovascular settings. In this Review, we summarize the available clinical and preclinical data on the different roles of eosinophils in CVD.",

    "abstract": "TGFβ-activated kinase-1 (TAK1) is phosphorylated during both muscle growth and muscle wasting. To understand how this can lead to such opposite effects, we first performed multiplex kinase array of mouse embryonic stem cells with and without stimulation of TAK1 to determine its potential downstream targets. The phosphorylation of these targets was then compared in three different models: hypertrophic longissimus muscle of Texel sheep, tibialis anterior muscle of mice with cancer-induced cachexia and C2C12-derived myofibers, with and without blockade of TAK1 phosphorylation. In both Texel sheep and in cancer-induced cachexia, phosphorylation of both TAK1 and p38 was increased. Whereas p90RSK was increased in Texel sheep but not cachexia and the phosphorylation of HSP27 and total Jnk were increased in cachexia but not Texel. To understand this further, we examined the expression of these proteins in C2C12 cells as they differentiated into myotubes, with and without blockade of TAK1 phosphorylation. In C2C12 cells, decreased phosphorylation of TAK1 leads to reduced phosphorylation of p38, JNK, and HSP27 after 16 h and muscle fiber hypertrophy after 3 days. However, continuous blockade of this pathway leads to muscle fiber failure, suggesting that the timing of TAK1 activation controls the expression of context-dependent targets.",

    "abstract": "DNA damage is emerging as a driver of heart disease, although the cascade of events, its timing, and the cell types involved are yet to be fully clarified. In this context, the implication of cardiomyocytes has been highlighted, while that of vasculature smooth muscle cells has been implicated but not explored exhaustively. In our previous work we characterized a factor called Ft1 in mice and AKTIP in humans whose depletion generates telomere instability and DNA damage. Herein, we explored the effect of the reduction of Ft1 on the heart with the goal of comparatively defining the impact of DNA damage targeted to vasculature smooth muscle cells to that of diffuse damage. Using two newly generated mouse models, Ft1 constitutively knocked out (Ft1ko) mice, and mice in which we targeted the Ft1 depletion to the smooth muscle cells (Ft1sm22ko), it is shown that both genetic models display cardiac defects but with differences. Both Ft1ko and Ft1sm22ko mice display hypertrophy, fibrosis, and functional heart defects. Interestingly, Ft1sm22ko mice have early milder pathological traits that become manifest with age. Significantly, the defects of Ft1ko mice, including the alteration of the left ventricle and functional heart defects, are rescued by depletion of the DNA damage sensor p53. These results point to Ft1 deficiency as a driver of cardiac disease and show that Ft1 deficiency targeted to vasculature smooth muscle cells generates a pre-pathological profile exacerbated by age.",

    "title": "Evaluation of the Timing of Use of Phosphatidic Acid in the Diet on Growth Performance and Breast Meat Yield in Broilers.",
    "abstract": "With a growing increase in further processing of poultry, there has been an increased interest in factors, including feed additives, that may improve broiler performance, increase growth, and influence dressing percentage. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is known to play vital roles in protein synthesis; mTOR controls the anabolic and catabolic signaling of skeletal muscle mass, resulting in the modulation of muscle hypertrophy. Exogenous phosphatidic acid (PA) can stimulate the mTOR pathway via its activation of the substrate S6 kinase. A study with 648 Cobb 500 male broilers, housed in 36 floor pens (1.11 m2) from 1 to 42 days of age was conducted to evaluate the timing of PA (Mediator® 50P, Chemi Nutra, Austin, TX, USA) supplementation on the growth performance and carcass yield of broilers. Dietary treatments included T1, Control (CON), T2, 5 mg/bird/day of PA for 42 days (d0−42, PAA); T3, 5 mg/bird/day of PA for 28 days (d15−42, PAGF); and T4, 5 mg/bird/day of PA for 14 days (d29−42, PAF). All birds were weighed on d14, 28, and 42 to obtain BW (body weight), FCR (feed conversion ratio), and MORT (mortality percentage). On d42, eight birds per pen were processed to determine carcass and breast meat yield. No differences were observed in BW at d14 or d28. At d42, birds fed PAA were heavier (3.73 ± 0.02, p < 0.05) than all dietary treatments (3.68 ± 0.02). From d0 to d28, birds fed PAA had the lowest FCR (1.423 ± 0.005, p < 0.05) compared to all dietary treatments (1.441 ± 0.005). From d0 to d42, birds fed PAA and PAGF had a lower FCR (1.545 ± 0.014, p < 0.05) when compared to the CON (1.609 ± 0.013). No differences were observed in MORT between treatments during growout. Increased BW observed in birds fed PAA translated to increased breast fillet weight (0.772 ± 0.009 kg, p < 0.05) when compared to the CON (0.743 ± 0.008 kg). Carcass yields were increased in birds fed PAA (77.48 ± 0.32 kg, p < 0.05) when compared to all dietary treatments (76.24 ± 0.16 kg). Utilizing PA for 42 days increased live weights, improved FCR, increased carcass yield, and increased breast fillet weight at processing. Results from this study indicate that supplementation of PA during all phases of growth may increase the production efficiency of broilers.",

    "abstract": "The prevalence of obesity is increasing worldwide, and obesity can cause type 2 diabetes, atherosclerosis, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Intake of medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) containing medium-chain fatty acids reduces body fat and insulin resistance in rodents and humans. This study aimed to determine how the timing of MCT consumption affects obesity and metabolic dysfunction induced in mice by a high-fat high-sucrose diet (HFHSD). Mice received an HFHSD with or without MCT (M-HFHSD) during either the active or rest phase for 9 weeks. Significant reduction in body weight, white adipose tissue (WAT) weight, and adipocyte size in epididymal WAT (eWAT) and improved insulin sensitivity in mice fed with M-HFHSD during the active but not the rest phase were observed. The consumption of M-HFHSD during both active and rest phases increased glucose tolerance. Phosphorylated Akt was more abundant in the gastrocnemius muscles and eWAT of M-HFHSD-fed mice than in those fed HFHSD during the active phase. The mRNA and protein expression of lipogenic genes increased in the eWAT of mice fed M-HFHSD compared with those fed HFHSD. Feeding with M-HFHSD during the active phase significantly increased the abundance of phosphorylated Ser563 and 660 of hormone-sensitive lipase and its upstream protein kinase A in eWAT. These results indicated that the timing of consumption modulates the effects of MCT on eWAT hypertrophy and glucose and lipid metabolism in mice.",

    "abstract": "As in other cardiomyopathies, extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling plays an important role in anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy. To understand the pattern and timing of ECM remodeling pathways, we conducted a systematic review in which we describe protein and mRNA markers for ECM remodeling that are differentially expressed in the hearts of animals with anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy. We included 68 studies in mice, rats, rabbits, and pigs with follow-up of 0.1-8.2 human equivalent years after anthracycline administration. Using meta-analysis, we found 29 proteins and 11 mRNAs that were differentially expressed in anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy compared to controls. Collagens, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), inflammation markers, transforming growth factor ß signaling markers, and markers for cardiac hypertrophy were upregulated, whereas the protein kinase B (AKT) pro-survival pathway was downregulated. Their expression patterns over time from single time point studies were studied with meta-regression using human equivalent years as the time scale. Connective tissue growth factor showed an early peak in expression but remained upregulated at all studied time points. Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and MMP9 protein levels increased in studies with longer follow-up. Significant associations were found for higher atrial natriuretic peptide with interstitial fibrosis and for higher BNP and MMP2 protein levels with left ventricular systolic function.",

    "title": "Branched chain amino acids selectively promote cardiac growth at the end of the awake period.",
    "abstract": "Essentially all biological processes fluctuate over the course of the day, manifesting as time-of-day-dependent variations with regards to the way in which organ systems respond to normal behaviors. For example, basic, translational, and epidemiologic studies indicate that temporal partitioning of metabolic processes governs the fate of dietary nutrients, in a manner in which concentrating caloric intake towards the end of the day is detrimental to both cardiometabolic and cardiovascular parameters. Despite appreciation that branched chain amino acids impact risk for obesity, diabetes mellitus, and heart failure, it is currently unknown whether the time-of-day at which dietary BCAAs are consumed influence cardiometabolic/cardiovascular outcomes. Here, we report that feeding mice a BCAA-enriched meal at the end of the active period (i.e., last 4 h of the dark phase) rapidly increases cardiac protein synthesis and mass, as well as cardiomyocyte size; consumption of the same meal at the beginning of the active period (i.e., first 4 h of the dark phase) is without effect. This was associated with a greater BCAA-induced activation of mTOR signaling in the heart at the end of the active period; pharmacological inhibition of mTOR (through rapamycin) blocked BCAA-induced augmentation of cardiac mass and cardiomyocyte size. Moreover, genetic disruption of the cardiomyocyte circadian clock abolished time-of-day-dependent fluctuations in BCAA-responsiveness. Finally, we report that repetitive consumption of BCAA-enriched meals at the end of the active period accelerated adverse cardiac remodeling and contractile dysfunction in mice subjected to transverse aortic constriction. Thus, our data demonstrate that the timing of BCAA consumption has significant implications for cardiac health and disease.",

    "abstract": "Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) is a dichotomous hormone. While beneficial for growth/repair, and regulating muscle hypertrophy, high concentrations of IGF-1 are associated with increased risk of cancer and mortality. Factors thought to mediate IGF-1 include dietary protein and exercise. The purpose of this study was to analyze acute effects of dietary protein and/or exercise on plasma free IGF-1 and the time-course thereof to inform individuals who may benefit from increased IGF-1 (muscle growth/repair) or reduced IGF-1 (risk/diagnosis of cancer). Twenty-four participants (11 females, 24.9±4.6y) completed the three-way crossover study consisting of: (1)a high protein (42g) meal; (2)exercise (20min with four 30sec sprints); and (3)exercise followed by a high protein meal. Blood samples were collected fasted at rest, immediately after rest (or 5min after exercise), and at regular intervals throughout a 5h recovery. An additional fasted venipuncture was performed the morning following each condition (24h after baseline). Free IGF-1 was higher at immediately after exercise in the exercise condition (p=0.04). In the protein condition the 24h IGF-1 was 17.5% higher (p=0.02) than baseline. IGF-1 did not change over time in response to exercise with protein. The data gleaned from this study can enhance the knowledge of the time-course effects from protein and/or exercise on IGF-1. This study can provide a foundation for future research to investigate optimal timing and dosage to enhance muscle protein synthesis for athletes, as well as investigate whether consistent high protein meals may chronically elevate IGF-1 and increase the risk of deleterious health outcomes.",

Both in fish and amniotes, much of the growth occurring after initial heart tube formation arises from second heart field (SHF)-derived progenitor cell addition to the arterial pole, allowing chamber formation. In zebrafish, this process has been extensively studied during embryonic life, but it is unclear how larval cardiac growth occurs beyond 3 days post-fertilisation (dpf). By quantifying zebrafish myocardial growth using live imaging of GFP-labelled myocardium we show that the heart grows extensively between 3 and 5 dpf. Using methods to assess cell division, cellular development timing assay and Kaede photoconversion, we demonstrate that proliferation, CM addition, and hypertrophy contribute to ventricle growth.

    "title": "Pre-sleep casein protein ingestion: new paradigm in post-exercise recovery nutrition.",
    "abstract": "Milk is a commonly ingested post-exercise recovery protein source. Casein protein, found in milk, is characterized by its slow digestion and absorption. Recently, several studies have been conducted with a focus on how pre-sleep casein protein intake could affect post-exercise recovery but our knowledge of the subject remains limited. This review aimed at presenting and discussing how pre-sleep casein protein ingestion affects post-exercise recovery and the details of its potential effector mechanisms. We systematically reviewed the topics of 1) casein nutritional characteristics, 2) pre-sleep casein protein effects on post-exercise recovery, and 3) potential effector mechanisms of pre-sleep casein protein on post-exercise recovery, based on the currently available published studies on pre-sleep casein protein ingestion. Studies have shown that pre-sleep casein protein ingestion (timing: 30 minutes before sleep, amount of casein protein ingested: 40-48 g) could help post-exercise recovery and positively affect acute protein metabolism and exercise performance. In addition, studies have suggested that repeated pre-sleep casein protein ingestion for post-exercise recovery over a long period might also result in chronic effects that optimize intramuscular physiological adaptation (muscle strength and muscle hypertrophy). The potential mechanisms of pre-sleep casein protein ingestion that contribute to these effects include the following: 1) significantly increasing plasma amino acid availability during sleep, thereby increasing protein synthesis, inhibiting protein breakdown, and achieving a positive protein balance; and 2) weakening exercise-induced muscle damage or inflammatory responses, causing reduced muscle soreness. Future studies should focus on completely elucidating these potential mechanisms. In conclusion, post-exercise ingestion of at least 40 g of casein protein, approximately 30 minutes before sleep and after a bout of resistance exercise in the evening, might be an effective nutritional intervention to facilitate muscle recovery.",

    "title": "Mechanism of Eccentric Cardiomyocyte Hypertrophy Secondary to Severe Mitral Regurgitation.",
    "abstract": "Primary valvular heart disease is a prevalent cause of morbidity and mortality in both industrialized and developing countries. Although the primary consequence of valvular heart disease is myocardial dysfunction, treatment of valvular heart diseases centers around valve repair or replacement rather than prevention or reversal of myocardial dysfunction. This is particularly evident in primary mitral regurgitation (MR), which invariably results in eccentric hypertrophy and left ventricular (LV) failure in the absence of timely valve repair or replacement. The mechanism of LV dysfunction in primary severe MR is entirely unknown. Here, we developed the first mouse model of severe MR. Valvular damage was achieved by severing the mitral valve leaflets and chords with iridectomy scissors, and MR was confirmed by echocardiography. Serial echocardiography was performed to follow up LV morphology and systolic function. Analysis of cardiac tissues was subsequently performed to evaluate valve deformation, cardiomyocyte morphology, LV fibrosis, and cell death. Finally, dysregulated pathways were assessed by RNA-sequencing analysis and immunofluorescence. In the ensuing 15 weeks after the induction of MR, gradual LV dilatation and dysfunction occurred, resulting in severe systolic dysfunction. Further analysis revealed that severe MR resulted in a marked increase in cardiac mass and increased cardiomyocyte length but not width, with electron microscopic evidence of sarcomere disarray and the development of sarcomere disruption. From a mechanistic standpoint, severe MR resulted in activation of multiple components of both the mammalian target of rapamycin and calcineurin pathways. Inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin signaling preserved sarcomeric structure and prevented LV remodeling and systolic dysfunction. Immunohistochemical analysis uncovered a differential pattern of expression of the cell polarity regulator Crb2 (crumbs homolog 2) along the longitudinal axis of cardiomyocytes and close to the intercalated disks in the MR hearts. Electron microscopy images demonstrated a significant increase in polysome localization in close proximity to the intercalated disks and some areas along the longitudinal axis in the MR hearts. These results indicate that LV dysfunction in response to severe MR is a form of maladaptive eccentric cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and outline the link between cell polarity regulation and spatial localization protein synthesis as a pathway for directional cardiomyocyte growth.",

    "abstract": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a congenital disease caused by mutations in a number of sarcomere proteins. According to the type of mutation, clinical observations record similar clinical manifestations, myocardial pathological changes, and the timing of manifestation of the disease in HCM patients. To study cardiomyocyte (CMC) ultrastructural changes in the interventricular septum (IVS) of patients with HCM and evaluate their specificity for this pathology. IVS myocardial samples taken from 44 HCM patients aged 18-59 years at IVS myoectomy underwent an electron microscopic study. The diameter of CMCs and their nuclei was measured in semithin sections. A morphometric examination of the IVS myocardium in HCM patients revealed moderate hypertrophy of CMCs and their nuclei, the diameters of which averaged 23.7±4.4 and 5.2±0.9 μm, respectively. The IVS CMCs were characterized by the ultrastructural signs of hypertrophy: the larger size and number of structures ensuring contractile and synthetic functions; the myocytes contained higher amounts of myofibrils, intermyofibrillar mitochondria, granular endoplasmic reticulum cisterns, and free ribosomes. On the contrary, some CMCs had fewer myofibrils in the perinuclear region, which is an adaptive change under hemodynamic overload conditions. In addition, a number of myocytes displayed signs of dystrophic changes: the appearance of lipofuscin granules, myelin figures, phagosomes, lipid droplets, and vacuoles, which can fill all free sarcoplasmic zones. Ultrastructural changes characteristic of hypertrophy were found in IVS CMCs in HCM patients. In addition, there was partial myofibrillar loss and dystrophic changes in a number of myocytes, which are stereotypic compensatory-adaptive changes under hemodynamic overload conditions. All the above-mentioned changes in the CMC ultrastructure are characteristic of myocardial hypertrophy, but not specific for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Гипертрофическая кардиомиопатия (ГКМП) - врожденное заболевание, причиной которого являются мутации ряда белков саркомера. По клиническим наблюдениям в зависимости от типа мутации у пациентов с ГКМП регистрируют сходные клинические проявления, патоморфологические изменения миокарда и сроки манифестирования заболевания. Цель исследования - изучить изменения ультраструктуры кардиомиоцитов межжелудочковой перегородки (МЖП) у пациентов с ГКМП и оценить их специфичность для данной патологии. Материал и методы. Проведено электронно-микроскопическое исследование миокарда МЖП у 44 пациентов с ГКМП в возрасте 18-59 лет, взятого во время миоэктомии МЖП. На полутонких срезах измерен диаметр кардиомиоцитов и их ядер. Результаты. Морфометрическое исследование миокарда МЖП у пациентов с ГКМП выявило умеренную гипертрофию кардиомиоцитов и их ядер, диаметры которых составляют в среднем 23,7±4,4 и 5,2±0,9 мкм соответственно. Для кардиомиоцитов МЖП характерны ультраструктурные признаки гипертрофии: увеличенный размер и число структур, обеспечивающих сократительную и синтетическую функции, в миоцитах увеличено содержание миофибрилл, межмиофибриллярных митохондрий, цистерн гранулярного эндоплазматического ретикулума, свободно лежащих рибосом. В некоторых кардиомиоцитах, напротив, содержание миофибрилл в околоядерной зоне снижено, что является адаптивным изменением в условиях гемодинамической перегрузки. Кроме того, в ряде миоцитов выявлены признаки дистрофических изменений: появление гранул липофусцина, миелиновых фигур, фагосом, липидных капель, вакуолей, которые могут заполнять все свободные зоны саркоплазмы. Заключение. В кардиомиоцитах миокарда МЖП у пациентов с ГКМП выявлены изменения ультраструктуры, характерные для гипертрофии. Кроме того, в ряде миоцитов обнаружены частичная утрата миофибрилл и дистрофические изменения, что является стереотипными компенсаторно-приспособительными изменениями в условиях гемодинамической перегрузки. Все указанные изменения ультраструктуры кардиомиоцитов являются характерными для гипертрофии миокарда, но неспецифичными для гипертрофической кардиомиопатии.",

    "title": "Periostin Reexpression in Heart Disease Contributes to Cardiac Interstitial Remodeling by Supporting the Cardiac Myofibroblast Phenotype.",
    "abstract": "Cardiac muscle (the myocardium) is a unique arrangement of atria and ventricles that are spatially and electrically separated by a fibrous border. The spirally-arranged myocytes in both left and right ventricles are tethered by the component molecules of the cardiac extracellular matrix (ECM), including fibrillar collagen types I and III. Loss of normal arrangement of the ECM with either too little (as is observed in acute myocardial infarction) or too much (cardiac fibrosis in chronic post-myocardial infarction) is the primary contributor to cardiac dysfunction and heart failure. Matricellular proteins exist as non-structural signaling moieties in the ECM, and in the context of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure, secreted 90 kDa periostin protein has attracted intense scrutiny during the past decade. Secreted periostin is now recognized for its important role in ECM development and maturation, as well as cellular adhesion. The novel mechanisms of periostin function include its role as a mediator of cell-to-matrix signaling, cell survival, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). A number of recent studies have examined the hypothesis that periostin is a major contributor to ECM remodeling in the heart, and a number of very recent studies underscore its important role. This review examines recent developments in the mechanisms of periostin function in the normal heart and vasculature, and discusses recent advances which underpin its putative role in the development of cardiovascular disease. Periostin expression is very low at baseline in healthy tissues, but is re-expressed in damaged heart and in vessel walls after injury, in activated cardiac myofibroblasts and vascular smooth muscle cells, respectively. For this reason, periostin may be exploited for investigation of mechanisms of cardiac fibrosis , and we speculate that data generated from studies utilizing this approach may shed light on the timing for application of periostin-specific therapies to quell cardiac fibrosis and associated cardiac dysfunction.",

Disease-causing sarcomere mutations are absent in ∼70% of patients with established disease, and sarcomere gene carriers can live to advanced ages without developing HCM. Some features of HCM are also inconsistent with the single sarcomere gene hypothesis, such as regional left ventricular hypertrophy and myocardial fibrosis, as well as structurally abnormal elongated mitral valve leaflets and remodeled intramural coronary arterioles, which involve tissue types that do not express cardiomyocyte sarcomere proteins. It is timely to expand the HCM research focus beyond a single molecular event toward more inclusive models to explain this disease in its entirety. The authors chart paths forward addressing this knowledge gap using novel analytical approaches, particularly network medicine, to unravel the pathobiological complexity of HCM.",

    "abstract": "PIK3CA-related overgrowth spectrum is a group of rare genetic disorders with asymmetric overgrowth caused by somatic mosaic PIK3CA mutations. Here, we report clinical data and molecular findings from two patients with congenital muscular upper limb overgrowth and aberrant anatomy. During debulking surgery, numerous ectopic muscles were found in the upper limbs of the patients. DNA sequencing, followed by digital polymerase chain reaction, was performed on DNA extracted from biopsies from hypertrophic ectopic muscles and identified the somatic mosaic PIK3CA hotspot mutations c.3140A > G, p.(His1047Arg) and c.1624G > A, p.(Glu542Lys) in a male (patient 1) and a female (patient 2) patient, respectively. Patient 1 had four ectopic muscles and unilateral isolated muscular overgrowth while patient 2 had 13 ectopic muscles and bilateral isolated muscular overgrowth of both upper limbs, indicating that her mutation occurred at early pre-somitic mesoderm state. The finding of PIK3CA mutations in ectopic muscles highlights the importance of PIK3CA in cell fate in early human embryonic development. Moreover, our findings provide evidence that the disease phenotype depends on the timing of PIK3CA mutagenesis during embryogenesis and confirm the diagnostic entity PIK3CA-related muscular overgrowth with ectopic accessory muscles.",

    "abstract": "Nutrient timing is a popular strategy for enhancing muscular adaptations and athletic performance. From the standpoint of muscle hypertrophy, the concept of a \"postworkout anabolic window of opportunity\" has been proposed, whereby a limited time exists after training to optimize accretion of muscle proteins. Some researchers have gone so far as to claim that the timing of nutritional consumption is even more critical to muscle development than the absolute daily consumption of nutrients. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to review the current literature as to the relevance of the anabolic window of opportunity, and draw evidence-based conclusions for application into practice.

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of pre- vs. post-workout nutrition on strength, body composition, and metabolism in trained females over 6 weeks of high intensity resistance training (HIRT). Forty-three trained females (mean±SD; age: 20.5±2.2 yrs; height: 165.2±5.7cm; body mass: 66.5±11.4kg) were measured for strength, body composition, and metabolic variables before and after a HIRT intervention. Participants were randomized using a 2:2:1 matched block randomization scheme by baseline leg press strength into a group that consumed a 1:1.5 carbohydrate-protein supplement (16g CHO/25g PRO) pre-training (PRE), post-training (POST), or no supplement (CON). Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry was used to evaluate fat mass (FM), lean mass (LM), and percent fat (%fat). Strength was analyzed using a one repetition max on the leg and bench press (LP1RM and BP1RM, respectively). Participants completed HIRT twice per week for 6 weeks. At the first and last trainings, metabolic variables [resting energy expenditure (REE) and respiratory exchange ratio, RER] were measured. There were no significant differences between groups for any changes in body composition variables or LP1RM (p=0.170-0.959). There were significant differences for BP1RM (p=0.007), with PRE and POST experiencing greater increases than CON (p=0.010 and 0.015, respectively). REE changes were not significant between groups (p=0.058-0.643). PRE demonstrated greater fat oxidation (RER) at 30min post-exercise (p=0.008-0.035). Peri-workout nutrition is potentially important for upper body strength and metabolism. PRE may be more effective for promoting fat utilization immediately post-workout.",

    "title": "Anabolic Heterogeneity Following Resistance Training: A Role for Circadian Rhythm?",
    "abstract": "It is now well established that resistance exercise stimulates muscle protein synthesis and promotes gains in muscle mass and strength. However, considerable variability exists following standardized resistance training programs in the magnitude of muscle cross-sectional area and strength responses from one individual to another. Several studies have recently posited that alterations in satellite cell population, myogenic gene expression and microRNAs may contribute to individual variability in anabolic adaptation. One emerging factor that may also explain the variability in responses to resistance exercise is circadian rhythms and underlying molecular clock signals. The molecular clock is found in most cells within the body, including skeletal muscle, and principally functions to optimize the timing of specific cellular events around a 24 h cycle. Accumulating evidence investigating the skeletal muscle molecular clock indicates that exercise-induced contraction and its timing may regulate gene expression and protein synthesis responses which, over time, can influence and modulate key physiological responses such as muscle hypertrophy and increased strength. Therefore, the circadian clock may play a key role in the heterogeneous anabolic responses with resistance exercise. The central aim of this Hypothesis and Theory is to discuss and propose the potential interplay between the circadian molecular clock and established molecular mechanisms mediating muscle anabolic responses with resistance training. This article begins with a current review of the mechanisms associated with the heterogeneity in muscle anabolism with resistance training before introducing the molecular pathways regulating circadian function in skeletal muscle. Recent work showing members of the core molecular clock system can regulate myogenic and translational signaling pathways is also discussed, forming the basis for a possible role of the circadian clock in the variable anabolic responses with resistance exercise.",

    "abstract": "Casein protein consumed before sleep has been suggested to offer an overnight supply of exogenous amino acids for anabolic processes. The purpose of this study was to compare supplemental casein consumed earlier in the day (DayTime, DT) versus shortly before bed (NightTime, NT) on body composition, strength, and muscle hypertrophy in response to supervised resistance training. Thirteen males participated in a 10-week exercise and dietary intervention while receiving 35 g casein daily. Isocaloric diets provided 1.8 g protein/kg body weight. Both groups increased (p < 0.05) in lean soft tissue (DT Pre: 58.3 ± 10.3 kg; DT Post: 61.1 ± 11.1 kg; NT Pre: 58.3 ± 8.6 kg; NT Post: 60.3 ± 8.2 kg), cross-sectional area (CSA, DT Pre: 3.4 ± 1.5 cm2; DT Post: 4.1 ± 1.7 cm2; NT Pre: 3.3 ± 1.6 cm2; NT Post: 3.7 ± 1.6 cm2) and strength in the leg press (DT Pre: 341 ± 87.3 kg; DT Post: 421.1 ± 94.0 kg; NT Pre: 450.0 ± 180.3 kg; NT Post: 533.9 ± 155.4 kg) and bench press (DT Pre: 89.0 ± 27.0 kg; DT Post: 101.0 ± 24.0 kg; NT Pre 100.8 ± 32.4 kg; NT Post: 109.1 ± 30.4 kg) with no difference between groups in any variable (p > 0.05). Both NT and DT protein consumption as part of a 24-h nutrition approach are effective for increasing strength and hypertrophy.

    "title": "Early Activation of Growth Pathways in Mitral Leaflets Exposed to Aortic Regurgitation: New Insights from an Animal Model.",
    "abstract": "Mitral leaflet enlargement in patients with chronic aortic regurgitation (AR) has been identified as an adaptive mechanism potentially able to prevent functional mitral regurgitation (FMR) in response to left ventricular (LV) dilatation. The timing of valve enlargement is not known, and the related mechanisms are largely unexplored. AR was induced in 58 rats, and another 54 were used as sham controls. Animals were euthanized at different time points after AR creation (48 h, one week, and three months), and AR severity, FMR and LV dilatation were assessed using echocardiography. Mitral valves were harvested to document the reactivation of embryonic growth pathways. AR animals had increased LV dimensions and mitral annulus size. No animal developed FMR. No change in leaflet length or thickness was seen at 48 h; however, anterior mitral leaflets were longer and thicker in AR animals at one week and three months. Molecular changes were present early (at 48 h and at one week), with positive staining for transforming growth factor-b1 (TGF-b1), Alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), which suggested active matrix remodeling. Increased gene expression for collagen 1, TGF-β1, α-SMA and MMP-2 was found in the mitral valve at 48 h and at one week, but after three months their expression had returned to normal. This model of AR induces active expansion and thickening of the mitral leaflets. Growth signals are expressed acutely, but not at three months, which suggests that most of this enlargement occurs at an early stage. The stimulation of valvular growth could represent a new strategy for the prevention of FMR.",

    "title": "Blood flow restricted training leads to myocellular macrophage infiltration and upregulation of heat shock proteins, but no apparent muscle damage.",
    "abstract": "Muscular contractions performed using a combination of low external loads and partial restriction of limb blood flow appear to induce substantial gains in muscle strength and muscle mass. This exercise regime may initially induce muscular stress and damage; however, the effects of a period of blood flow restricted training on these parameters remain largely unknown. The present study shows that short-term, high-frequency, low-load muscle training performed with partial blood flow restriction does not induce significant muscular damage. However, signs of myocellular stress and inflammation that were observed in the early phase of training and after the training intervention, respectively, may be facilitating the previously reported gains in myogenic satellite cell content and muscle hypertrophy. The present results improve our current knowledge about the physiological effects of low-load muscular contractions performed under blood flow restriction and may provide important information of relevance for future therapeutic treatment of muscular atrophy. Previous studies indicate that low-load muscle contractions performed under local blood flow restriction (BFR) may initially induce muscle damage and stress. However, whether these factors are evoked with longitudinal BFR training remains unexplored at the myocellular level. Two distinct study protocols were conducted, covering 3 weeks (3 wk) or one week (1 wk). Subjects performed BFR exercise (100 mmHg, 20% 1RM) to concentric failure (BFRE) (3 wk/1 wk), while controls performed work-matched (LLE) (3 wk) or high-load (HLE; 70% 1RM) (1 wk) free-flow exercise. Muscle biopsies (3 wk) were obtained at baseline (Pre), 8 days into the intervention (Mid8), and 3 and 10 days after training cessation (Post3, Post10) to examine macrophage (M1/M2) content as well as heat shock protein (HSP27/70) and tenascin-C expression. Blood samples (1 wk) were collected before and after (0.1-24 h) the first and last training session to examine markers of muscle damage (creatine kinase), oxidative stress (total antibody capacity, glutathione) and inflammation (monocyte chemotactic protein-1, interleukin-6, tumour necrosis factor α). M1-macrophage content increased 108-165% with BFRE and LLE at Post3 (P < 0.05), while M2-macrophages increased (163%) with BFRE only (P < 0.01). Membrane and intracellular HSP27 expression increased 60-132% at Mid8 with BFRE (P < 0.05-0.01). No or only minor changes were observed in circulating markers of muscle damage, oxidative stress and inflammation. The amplitude, timing and localization of the above changes indicate that only limited muscle damage was evoked with BFRE. This study is the first to show that a period of high-frequency, low-load BFR training does not appear to induce general myocellular damage. However, signs of tissue inflammation and focal myocellular membrane stress and/or reorganization were observed that may be involved in the adaptation processes evoked by BFR muscle exercise.",

    "abstract": "The nondystrophic skeletal muscle channelopathies are a group of disorders caused by mutations of various voltage-gated ion channel genes, including nondystrophic myotonia and periodic paralysis. We identified patients with a diagnosis of muscle channelopathy from our neuromuscular database in a tertiary care pediatric center from 2005 to 2015. We then performed a retrospective review of their medical records for demographic characteristics, clinical features, investigations, treatment, and follow-up. Thirty-three patients were identified. Seventeen had nondystrophic myotonia. Seven of them had chloride channelopathy (four Becker disease and three Thomsen disease). Warm-up phenomenon and muscle hypertrophy were common clinical manifestations in this subgroup. Ten patients had sodium channelopathy (four paramyotonia congenita and six other sodium channel myotonia). Stiffness of the facial muscles was an important presenting symptom, and eyelid myotonia was a common clinical finding in this subgroup. The majority of these patients had electrical myotonia. Mexiletine was effective in controlling the symptoms in patients who had received treatment. Sixteen children had periodic paralysis (four hyperkalemic periodic paralysis, eight hypokalemic periodic paralysis, and four Andersen-Tawil syndrome). Acetazolamide was commonly used to prevent paralytic attacks and was found to be effective. Nondystrophic muscle channelopathies present with diverse clinical manifestations (myotonia, muscle hypertrophy, proximal weakness, swallowing difficulties, and periodic paralysis). Cardiac arrhythmias are potentially life threatening in Andersen-Tawil syndrome. Timely identification of these disorders is helpful for effective symptomatic management and genetic counseling.",

    "title": "Dietary proteins and amino acids in the control of the muscle mass during immobilization and aging: role of the MPS response.",
    "abstract": "Dietary proteins/essential amino acids (EAAs) are nutrients with anabolic properties that may increase muscle mass or attenuate muscle loss during immobilization and aging via the stimulation of muscle protein synthesis (MPS). An EAA's anabolic threshold, capable to maximize the stimulation of MPS has been hypothesized, but during certain conditions associated with muscle loss, this anabolic threshold seems to increase which reduces the efficacy of dietary EAAs to stimulate MPS. Preliminary studies have demonstrated that acute ingestion of dietary proteins/EAA (with a sufficient amount of leucine) was capable to restore the postprandial MPS during bed rest, immobilization or aging; however, whether these improvements translate into chronic increases (or attenuates loss) of muscle mass is equivocal. For example, although free leucine supplementation acutely increases MPS and muscle mass in some chronic studies, other studies have reported no increases in muscle mass following chronic leucine supplementation. In contrast, chronically increasing leucine intake via the consumption of an overall increase in dietary protein appears to be the most effective dietary intervention toward increasing or attenuating lean mass during aging; however, more research investigating the optimal dose and timing of protein ingestion is necessary. Several studies have demonstrated that decreases in postprandial MPS as a result of increased circulating oxidative and inflammatory are more responsible than muscle protein breakdown for the decreases in muscle mass during disuse and health aging. Therefore, nutritional interventions that reduce oxidation or inflammation in conjunction with higher protein intakes that overcome the anabolic resistance may enhance the MPS response to feeding and either increase muscle mass or attenuate loss. In preliminary studies, antioxidant vitamins and amino acids with antioxidant or anti-inflammatory properties show potential to restore the anabolic response associated with protein ingestion. More research, however, is required to investigate if these nutrients translate to increases in MPS and, ultimately, increased lean mass in aging humans. The purpose of the present review is to discuss the role of protein/EAA intake to enhance postprandial MPS during conditions associated with muscle loss, and bring new perspectives and challenges associated nutritional interventions aimed to optimize the anabolic effects of dietary protein/EAAs ingestion.",

    "abstract": "Protein ingestion following resistance-type exercise stimulates muscle protein synthesis rates, and enhances the skeletal muscle adaptive response to prolonged resistance-type exercise training. As the adaptive response to a single bout of resistance exercise extends well beyond the first couple of hours of post-exercise recovery, recent studies have begun to investigate the impact of the timing and distribution of protein ingestion during more prolonged recovery periods. Recent work has shown that overnight muscle protein synthesis rates are restricted by the level of amino acid availability. Protein ingested prior to sleep is effectively digested and absorbed, and thereby stimulates muscle protein synthesis rates during overnight recovery. When applied during a prolonged period of resistance-type exercise training, protein supplementation prior to sleep can further augment gains in muscle mass and strength. Recent studies investigating the impact of pre-sleep protein ingestion suggest that at least 40 g of protein is required to display a robust increase in muscle protein synthesis rates throughout overnight sleep. Furthermore, prior exercise allows more of the pre-sleep protein-derived amino acids to be utilized for de novo muscle protein synthesis during sleep. In short, pre-sleep protein ingestion represents an effective dietary strategy to improve overnight muscle protein synthesis, thereby improving the skeletal muscle adaptive response to exercise training.",

    "title": "Controlled Heat Stress Promotes Myofibrillogenesis during Myogenesis.",
    "abstract": "Hyperthermia therapy has recently emerged as a clinical modality used to finely tune heat stress inside the human body for various biomedical applications. Nevertheless, little is known regarding the optimal timing or temperature of heat stress that is needed to achieve favorable results following hyperthermia therapy for muscle regeneration purposes. The regeneration of skeletal muscle after injury is a highly complex and coordinated process that involves a multitude of cellular mechanisms. The main objective of this study was to characterize the effects of hyperthermal therapy on the overall behavior of myoblasts during myogenic differentiation. Various cellular processes, including myogenesis, myofibrillogenesis, hypertrophy/atrophy, and mitochondrial biogenesis, were studied using systematic cellular, morphological, and pathway-focused high-throughput gene expression profiling analyses. We found that C2C12 myoblasts exhibited distinctive time and temperature-dependence in biosynthesis and regulatory events during myogenic differentiation. Specifically, we for the first time observed that moderate hyperthermia at 39°C favored the growth of sarcomere in myofibrils at the late stage of myogenesis, showing universal up-regulation of characteristic myofibril proteins. Characteristic myofibrillogenesis genes, including heavy polypeptide 1 myosin, heavy polypeptide 2 myosin, alpha 1 actin, nebulin and titin, were all significantly upregulated (p<0.01) after C2C12 cells differentiated at 39°C over 5 days compared with the control cells cultured at 37°C. Furthermore, moderate hyperthermia enhanced myogenic differentiation, with nucleus densities per myotube showing 2.2-fold, 1.9-fold and 1.6-fold increases when C2C12 cells underwent myogenic differentiation at 39°C over 24 hours, 48 hours and 72 hours, respectively, as compared to the myotubes that were not exposed to heat stress. Yet, atrophy genes were sensitive even to moderate hyperthermia, indicating that strictly controlled heat stress is required to minimize the development of atrophy in myotubes. In addition, mitochondrial biogenesis was enhanced following thermal induction of myoblasts, suggesting a subsequent shift toward anabolic demand requirements for energy production. This study offers a new perspective to understand and utilize the time and temperature-sensitive effects of hyperthermal therapy on muscle regeneration.",

    "title": "Spacial and Temporal Patterns of Gene Expression After Cardiac MEK1 Gene Transfer Improve Post-Infarction Remodeling Without Inducing Global Hypertrophy.",
    "abstract": "Alteration of mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling in transgenic mice can ameliorate post-myocardial infarction (MI) remodeling. However, pre-existing changes in transgenic hearts and clinically unrealistic transgene expression likely affect the response to injury; it is unknown whether clinically relevant induction of transgene expression in an otherwise normal heart can yield similar benefits. Constitutively active MEK1 (aMEK1) or LacZ adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV9) vectors were injected into the left ventricular (LV) chambers of mice either just before or after coronary ligation. Hearts were evaluated via Western blot, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, histology, and echocardiography. AAV9-mediated aMEK1 delivery altered ERK1/2 expression/activation as in transgenic mice. Transgene expression was not immediately detectable but plateaued at 17 days, and therefore did not likely impact acute ischemia as it would in transgenics. With AAV9-aMEK1 injection just prior to MI, robust expression in the infarct border zone during post-MI remodeling increased border zone wall thickness and reduced infarct size versus controls at 4 weeks, but did not induce global hypertrophy. Significant improvements in local and global LV function were observed, as were trends toward a preservation of LV volume. Delivery after ligation significantly lowered transgene expression in the infarct border zone and did not yield structural or functional benefits. The primary benefits observed in transgenic mice, ameliorated remodeling, and reduced chronic infarct size, were achievable via clinically relevant gene transfer of aMEK1, supporting ongoing translational efforts. Important differences, however, were observed, and consideration must be given to the timing and distribution of transgene delivery and expression. J. Cell.

    "abstract": "The relative resistance of fibroblasts to hypoxia and their remarkable adaptive plasticity in response to rapid changes in local tissue microenvironment made interstitial cardiac fibroblasts to be a key player in post-myocardial infarction myocardial repair. Cardiac fibroblasts are abundantly presented in the interstitial and perivascular extracellular matrix. These cells can be rapidly mobilized in response to cardiac injury. Inflammatory activation of fibroblasts leads to the loss of their quiescent phenotype and inhibition of matrix-producing capacity. Acute inflammation that follows the infarct induces production of inflammatory mediators, matrix-degrading activity, proliferation, and migration of fibroblasts. Fibroblasts migrate to the injured myocardial site where undergo transdifferentiation to myofibroblasts in response to anti-inflammatory and mitogenic stimuli. They acquire capacity to synthesize matrix and contractile proteins. In the infarcted zone, fibroblasts/myofibroblasts actively proliferate, expand, and extensively produce and deposit collagen and other matrix proteins. The proliferative stage of heart healing transits to the scar maturation stage, in which collagen-based scar exhibits formation of intramolecular and extramolecular cross-links, deactivation and apoptosis of fibroblasts/myofibroblasts. Generally, cardiac reparation is strongly controlled. Inability to pass from one repair stage to another in a timely manner can induce detrimental events such as expansion of the infarct area due to advanced inflammation, cardiac fibrosis and adverse remodeling due to the excessive proliferative and profibrotic response, left ventricular hypertrophy, arrhythmogenicity, and heart failure.",

    "title": "The Differential Hormonal Milieu of Morning versus Evening May Have an Impact on Muscle Hypertrophic Potential.",
    "abstract": "Substantial gains in muscle strength and hypertrophy are clearly associated with the routine performance of resistance training. What is less evident is the optimal timing of the resistance training stimulus to elicit these significant functional and structural skeletal muscle changes. Therefore, this investigation determined the impact of a single bout of resistance training performed either in the morning or evening upon acute anabolic signalling (insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3), myogenic index and differentiation) and catabolic processes (cortisol). Twenty-four male participants (age 21.4±1.9yrs, mass 83.7±13.7kg) with no sustained resistance training experience were allocated to a resistance exercise group (REP). Sixteen of the 24 participants were randomly selected to perform an additional non-exercising control group (CP) protocol. REP performed two bouts of resistance exercise (80% 1RM) in the morning (AM: 0800 hrs) and evening (PM: 1800 hrs), with the sessions separated by a minimum of 72 hours. Venous blood was collected immediately prior to, and 5 min after, each resistance exercise and control sessions. Serum cortisol and IGFBP-3 levels, myogenic index, myotube width, were determined at each sampling period. All data are reported as mean ± SEM, statistical significance was set at P≤0.05. As expected a significant reduction in evening cortisol concentration was observed at pre (AM: 98.4±10.5, PM: 49.8±4.4 ng/ml, P<0.001) and post (AM: 98.0±9.0, PM: 52.7±6.0 ng/ml, P<0.001) exercise. Interestingly, individual cortisol differences pre vs post exercise indicate a time-of-day effect (AM difference: -2±2.6%, PM difference: 14.0±6.7%, P = 0.03). A time-of-day related elevation in serum IGFBP-3 (AM: 3274.9 ± 345.2, PM: 3605.1 ± 367.5, p = 0.032) was also evident. Pre exercise myogenic index (AM: 8.0±0.6%, PM: 16.8±1.1%) and myotube width (AM: 48.0±3.0, PM: 71.6±1.9 μm) were significantly elevated (P<0.001) in the evening. Post exercise myogenic index was greater AM (11.5±1.6%) compared with PM (4.6±0.9%). No difference was observed in myotube width (AM: 48.5±1.5, PM: 47.8±1.8 μm) (P>0.05). Timing of resistance training regimen in the evening appears to augment some markers of hypertrophic potential, with elevated IGFBP-3, suppressed cortisol and a superior cellular environment. Further investigation, to further elucidate the time course of peak anabolic signalling in morning vs evening training conditions, are timely.",

    "abstract": "The timing and consequences of alternations in substrate utilization in heart failure (HF) and their relationship with structural changes remain unclear. This study aimed to analyze metabolic changes associated with transition to overt heart failure in transgenic mouse model of HF resulting from cardiac-specific overexpression of constitutively active Gαq*. Structural changes quantified by morphometry, relative cardiac mRNA and protein expression of PPARα, FAT/CD36, CPT-1, GLUT-4 and glycolytic efficiency following administration of 1-(13)C glucose were investigated in 4-14-month-old Tgαq*44 mice (TG), compared with age-matched FVB wild type mice (WT). Initial hypertrophy in TG (4-10-month of age) was featured by an accelerated glycolytic pathway that was not accompanied by structural changes in cardiomyocytes. In 10-month-old TG, cardiomyocyte elongation and hypertrophic remodeling and increased glycolytic flux was accompanied by relatively low expression of FAT/CD36, CPT-1 and PPARα. During the transition phase (12-month-old TG), a pronounced increase in PPARα with an increase in relative fatty acid (FA) flux was associated with anomalies of cardiomyocytes with accumulation of lipid droplets and glycogen as well as cell death. At the stage of overt heart failure (14-month-old TG), an accelerated glycolytic pathway with a decline in FA oxidation was accompanied by further structural changes. Tgαq*44 mice display three distinct phases of metabolic/structural changes during hypertrophy and progression to HF, with relatively short period of increase in FA metabolism, highlighting a narrow metabolic changes associated with transition to overt heart failure in Tgaq*44 mice that have therapeutic significance.",

    "title": "Cellular recruitment in myocardial ischaemia/reperfusion injury.",
    "abstract": "Myocardial infarction (MI) is strictly linked to atherosclerosis. Beyond the mechanical narrowing of coronary vessels lumen, during MI a great burden of inflammation is carried out. One of the crucial events is represented by the ischaemia/reperfusion injury, a complex event involving inflammatory cells (such as neutrophils, platelets, monocytes/macrophages, lymphocytes and mast cells) and key activating signals (such as cytokines, chemokines and growth factors). Cardiac repair following myocardial infarction is dependent on a finely regulated response involving a sequential recruitment and the clearance of different subsets of inflammatory cells. This narrative review was based on the works detected on PubMed and MEDLINE up to November 2015. Infarct healing classically follows three overlapping phases: the inflammatory phase, in which the innate immune pathways are activated and inflammatory leucocytes are recruited in order to clear the wound from dead cells; the proliferative phase, characterized by the suppression of pro-inflammatory signalling and infiltration of 'repairing' cells secreting matrix proteins in the injured area; and the maturation phase, which is associated with the quiescence and the elimination of the reparative cells together with cross-linking of the matrix. All these phases are timely regulated by the production of soluble mediators, such as cytokines, chemokines and growth factors. Targeting inflammatory cell recruitment early during reperfusion and healing might be promising to selectively inhibit injury and favour repair. This approach might substantially improve adverse postischaemic left ventricle remodelling, characterized by dilation, hypertrophy of viable segments and progressive dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "Skeletal muscle is critical for human health. Protein feeding, alongside resistance exercise, is a potent stimulus for muscle protein synthesis (MPS) and is a key factor that regulates skeletal muscle mass (SMM). The main purpose of this narrative review was to evaluate the latest evidence for optimising the amino acid or protein source, dose, timing, pattern and macronutrient coingestion for increasing or preserving SMM in healthy young and healthy older adults. We used a systematic search strategy of PubMed and Web of Science to retrieve all articles related to this review objective. In summary, our findings support the notion that protein guidelines for increasing or preserving SMM are more complex than simply recommending a total daily amount of protein. Instead, multifactorial interactions between protein source, dose, timing, pattern and macronutrient coingestion, alongside exercise, influence the stimulation of MPS, and thus should be considered in the context of protein recommendations for regulating SMM. To conclude, on the basis of currently available scientific literature, protein recommendations for optimising SMM should be tailored to the population or context of interest, with consideration given to age and resting/post resistance exercise conditions.",

    "abstract": "The calcium channel blocker (CCB), nifedipine, is a more effective treatment for early- than late-stage cardiac hypertrophy. We investigated the effects of early- and late-stage nifedipine administration on calcium homeostasis, CaMKII (Ca(2+) /calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II) activity and apoptosis of cardiomyocytes under hypertrophic stimulation with angiotensin II (AngII). Primary rat cardiomyocytes were divided into five treatment groups: AK, AngII plus the CaMKII inhibitor, KN-93; AN-1 (early-stage), AngII plus nifedipine × 48 h; AN-2 (late-stage), AngII × 48 h, then AngII plus nifedipine × 48 h; C, untreated; and A, AngII × 48 h. The t1/2β [time required for intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+) ]i) to decline to one half of the peak value] decreased; however, CaMKII and SERCA2a (sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) -ATPase 2a) activities increased in the AN-1 group compared with the AK group. In the AN-2 group compared with the AN-1 group, CaMKII activity, t1/2α [time required for [Ca(2+) ]i to increase from the bottom to one half of peak value], t1/2β, and apoptosis increased. These results indicate that the timing of CCB administration affects the calcium concentration and apoptosis of hypertrophic cardiomyocytes through the CaMKII-SERCA2a signalling pathway, thereby influencing the drug's protective activity against cardiomyocyte hypertrophy.",

Results of molecular analysis revealed a de novo SCN4A G1306E mutation.

    "abstract": "The signal peptide for human B-type natriuretic peptide preprohormone (BNPsp), which is released from cardiomyocytes, is increased in plasma of patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI); however, its exact release kinetics have not been defined. We measured BNPsp and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) in a reference group of individuals without structural heart disease (n = 285) and determined the release kinetics of these biomarkers in patients (n = 29) with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy undergoing transcoronary ablation of septal hypertrophy (TASH), a procedure allowing exact timing of onset of iatrogenic AMI. Blood samples were collected before TASH and at numerous preselected time points after TASH. The reference median BNPsp concentration was 53.4 pmol/L [interquartile range (IQR) 47.0-61.0; 95th percentile 85.9 pmol/L; 99th percentile 116.3 pmol/L]. Baseline concentrations in patients undergoing TASH were higher than in the reference group [91.9 pmol/L (IQR 62.9-116.4); P < 0.0001]. BNPsp increased significantly, peaking at 15 min after induction of AMI [149.6 pmol/L (109.5-204.9) vs baseline; P = 0.004] and declining slowly thereafter, falling below the preprocedural value after 8 h (P = 0.014). hs-cTnT increased significantly 15 min after induction of AMI [26 ng/L (19-39) vs 18 ng/L (11-29); P = 0.001] and remained high at all later time points. BNPsp concentrations increased immediately after AMI induction, providing early evidence of myocardial injury. The release kinetics of BNPsp differed from those of hs-cTnT. These findings provide information that should help in establishing the diagnostic value of BNPsp in the setting of early AMI.",

    "title": "Innervating sympathetic neurons regulate heart size and the timing of cardiomyocyte cell cycle withdrawal.",
    "abstract": "Sympathetic drive to the heart is a key modulator of cardiac function and interactions between heart tissue and innervating sympathetic fibres are established early in development. Significant innervation takes place during postnatal heart development, a period when cardiomyocytes undergo a rapid transition from proliferative to hypertrophic growth. The question of whether these innervating sympathetic fibres play a role in regulating the modes of cardiomyocyte growth was investigated using 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) to abolish early sympathetic innervation of the heart. Postnatal chemical sympathectomy resulted in rats with smaller hearts, indicating that heart growth is regulated by innervating sympathetic fibres during the postnatal period. In vitro experiments showed that sympathetic interactions resulted in delays in markers of cardiomyocyte maturation, suggesting that changes in the timing of the transition from hyperplastic to hypertrophic growth of cardiomyocytes could underlie changes in heart size in the sympathectomized animals. There was also an increase in the expression of Meis1, which has been linked to cardiomyocyte cell cycle withdrawal, suggesting that sympathetic signalling suppresses cell cycle withdrawal. This signalling involves β-adrenergic activation, which was necessary for sympathetic regulation of cardiomyocyte proliferation and hypertrophy. The effect of β-adrenergic signalling on cardiomyocyte hypertrophy underwent a developmental transition. While young postnatal cardiomyocytes responded to isoproterenol (isoprenaline) with a decrease in cell size, mature cardiomyocytes showed an increase in cell size in response to the drug. Together, these results suggest that early sympathetic effects on proliferation modulate a key transition between proliferative and hypertrophic growth of the heart and contribute to the sympathetic regulation of adult heart size.",

    "abstract": "Distal esophageal spasm (DES) is a rare esophageal motility disorder associated with dysphagia and chest pain. In 2011, the diagnosis of DES was refined based on the occurrence of premature (rather than rapid) contractions by high-resolution manometry. New therapeutic options have also been recently proposed. Thus, a review on DES incorporating publications since 2012 is timely because of these revisions in definition and management. DES remains a heterogeneous clinical disorder. Its pathophysiology is still debated and DES might be related to achalasia. Alternatively, it might be secondary to medications, especially opiates. Endoscopic ultrasound might be informative diagnostically by demonstrating muscularis propria hypertrophy and thickening. Botulinum toxin injection in the esophageal body has been shown superior to placebo to relieve symptoms associated with DES. Finally, per oral endoscopic myotomy is a promising therapeutic approach, but may be less effective in DES than in achalasia. The diagnosis of DES should lead to a systematic search for medication that might promote the occurrence of esophageal dysmotility. Endoscopic treatment of DES (botulinum toxin injection or per oral endoscopic myotomy) should be further evaluated in controlled studies using current diagnostic criteria by high-resolution manometry.",

    "abstract": "Laryngospasm is a rare but potentially life-threatening occurrence in infants and usually has infective, allergic, metabolic, or anatomic causes. Underlying genetic conditions are rarely considered. Mutations in SCN4A encoding the voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.4 have been implicated in a wide spectrum of neuromuscular disorders with variable onset, ranging from a rare form of congenital myasthenic syndrome to both hypokalemic and hyperkalemic forms of periodic paralysis and paramyotonia congenita. Here we report on 3 unrelated patients without family history presenting with recurrent, life-threatening episodes of laryngospasm from the first months of life. Clinical features more typically associated with SCN4A-related disorders such as generalized muscle hypertrophy with clinical or electrical myotonia evolved later in life. All patients were found to be heterozygous for the same SCN4A mutation, c.3917G>A; p.Gly1306Glu. Treatment with carbamazepine resulted in complete abolition of recurrent laryngospasm and alleviated symptoms associated with myotonia and muscle stiffness. We conclude that SCN4A mutations ought to be considered in the differential diagnosis of recurrent infantile laryngospasm because timely institution of treatment can be life-saving.",

The hypothesis to be tested was that the difference between right and left balance of occlusal force diminishes over time following BTX-A injection. Fifteen patients were submitted to BTX-A injection therapy for subjective masseter hypertrophy. A total of 25 U of BTX-A (50 U in total) was injected into two points located 1 cm apart at the center of the lower one-third of both masseter muscles. All patients were examined using the T-Scan occlusion analysis system before and 4, 8, 12, and 24 weeks after BTX-A injection. A significant change in force balance was found between the right and left sides over time and the difference between the two sides decreased with the time post-injection, reaching a minimum at 12 weeks. Comparison of the force balance between the anterior and posterior occlusions revealed no significant difference at any of the time points. The occlusion and disclusion times (right and left sides) did not differ significantly with time since BTX-A injection. A decline in the difference in the clenching force between the left and right sides was found with increasing time up to 12 weeks following BTX-A injection.",

    "abstract": "G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) is an important serine/threonine-kinase regulating different membrane receptors and intracellular proteins. Attenuation of Drosophila Gprk2 in embryos or adult flies induced a defective differentiation of somatic muscles, loss of fibers, and a flightless phenotype. In vertebrates, GRK2 hemizygous mice contained less but more hypertrophied skeletal muscle fibers than wild-type littermates. In C2C12 myoblasts, overexpression of a GRK2 kinase-deficient mutant (K220R) caused precocious differentiation of cells into immature myotubes, which were wider in size and contained more fused nuclei, while GRK2 overexpression blunted differentiation. Moreover, p38MAPK and Akt pathways were activated at an earlier stage and to a greater extent in K220R-expressing cells or upon kinase downregulation, while the activation of both kinases was impaired in GRK2-overexpressing cells. The impaired differentiation and fewer fusion events promoted by enhanced GRK2 levels were recapitulated by a p38MAPK mutant, which was able to mimic the inhibitory phosphorylation of p38MAPK by GRK2, whereas the blunted differentiation observed in GRK2-expressing clones was rescued in the presence of a constitutively active upstream stimulator of the p38MAPK pathway. These results suggest that balanced GRK2 function is necessary for a timely and complete myogenic process.",

    "abstract": "Recovery from the demands of daily training is an essential element of a scientifically based periodized program whose twin goals are to maximize training adaptation and enhance performance. Prolonged endurance training sessions induce substantial metabolic perturbations in skeletal muscle, including the depletion of endogenous fuels and damage/disruption to muscle and body proteins. Therefore, increasing nutrient availability (i.e., carbohydrate and protein) in the post-training recovery period is important to replenish substrate stores and facilitate repair and remodelling of skeletal muscle. It is well accepted that protein ingestion following resistance-based exercise increases rates of skeletal muscle protein synthesis and potentiates gains in muscle mass and strength. To date, however, little attention has focused on the ability of dietary protein to enhance skeletal muscle remodelling and stimulate adaptations that promote an endurance phenotype. The purpose of this review is to critically discuss the results of recent studies that have examined the role of dietary protein for the endurance athlete. Our primary aim is to consider the results from contemporary investigations that have advanced our knowledge of how the manipulation of dietary protein (i.e., amount, type, and timing of ingestion) can facilitate muscle remodelling by promoting muscle protein synthesis. We focus on the role of protein in facilitating optimal recovery from, and promoting adaptations to strenuous endurance-based training.",

    "title": "Nonmyocytic androgen receptor regulates the sexually dimorphic development of the embryonic bulbocavernosus muscle.",
    "abstract": "The bulbocavernosus (BC) is a sexually dimorphic muscle observed only in males. Androgen receptor knockout mouse studies show the loss of BC formation. This suggests that androgen signaling plays a vital role in its development. Androgen has been known to induce muscle hypertrophy through satellite cell activation and myonuclei accretion during muscle regeneration and growth. Whether the same mechanism is present during embryonic development is not yet elucidated. To identify the mechanism of sexual dimorphism during BC development, the timing of morphological differences was first established. It was revealed that the BC was morphologically different between male and female mice at embryonic day (E) 16.5. Differences in the myogenic process were detected at E15.5. The male BC possesses a higher number of proliferating undifferentiated myoblasts. To identify the role of androgen signaling in this process, muscle-specific androgen receptor (AR) mutation was introduced, which resulted in no observable phenotypes. Hence, the expression of AR in the BC was examined and found that the AR did not colocalize with any muscle markers such as Myogenic differentiation 1, Myogenin, and paired box transcription factor 7. It was revealed that the mesenchyme surrounding the BC expressed AR and the BC started to express AR at E15.5. AR mutation on the nonmyocytic cells using spalt-like transcription factor 1 (Sall1) Cre driver mouse was performed, which resulted in defective BC formation. It was revealed that the number of proliferating undifferentiated myoblasts was reduced in the Sall1 Cre:AR(L-/Y) mutant embryos, and the adult mutants were devoid of BC. The transition of myoblasts from proliferation to differentiation is mediated by cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors. An increased expression of p21 was observed in the BC myoblast of the Sall1 Cre:AR(L-/Y) mutant and wild-type female. Altogether this study suggests that the nonmyocytic AR may paracrinely regulate the proliferation of myoblast possibly through inhibiting p21 expression in myoblasts of the BC.",

    "title": "The vertebrate RCAN gene family: novel insights into evolution, structure and regulation.",
    "abstract": "Recently there has been much interest in the Regulators of Calcineurin (RCAN) proteins which are important endogenous modulators of the calcineurin-NFATc signalling pathway. They have been shown to have a crucial role in cellular programmes such as the immune response, muscle fibre remodelling and memory, but also in pathological processes such as cardiac hypertrophy and neurodegenerative diseases. In vertebrates, the RCAN family form a functional subfamily of three members RCAN1, RCAN2 and RCAN3 whereas only one RCAN is present in the rest of Eukarya. In addition, RCAN genes have been shown to collocate with RUNX and CLIC genes in ACD clusters (ACD21, ACD6 and ACD1). How the RCAN genes and their clustering in ACDs evolved is still unknown. After analysing RCAN gene family evolution using bioinformatic tools, we propose that the three RCAN vertebrate genes within the ACD clusters, which evolved from single copy genes present in invertebrates and lower eukaryotes, are the result of two rounds of whole genome duplication, followed by a segmental duplication. This evolutionary scenario involves the loss or gain of some RCAN genes during evolution. In addition, we have analysed RCAN gene structure and identified the existence of several characteristic features that can be involved in RCAN evolution and gene expression regulation. These included: several transposable elements, CpG islands in the 5' region of the genes, the existence of antisense transcripts (NAT) associated with the three human genes, and considerable evidence for bidirectional promoters that regulate RCAN gene expression. Furthermore, we show that the CpG island associated with the RCAN3 gene promoter is unmethylated and transcriptionally active. All these results provide timely new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying RCAN function and a more in depth knowledge of this gene family whose members are obvious candidates for the development of future therapies.",

    "abstract": "Synchronized release of Ca²⁺ into the cytosol during each cardiac cycle determines cardiomyocyte contraction. We investigated synchrony of cytosolic [Ca²⁺] decay during diastole and the impact of cardiac remodeling. Local cytosolic [Ca²⁺] transients (1-µm intervals) were recorded in murine, porcine, and human ventricular single cardiomyocytes. We identified intracellular regions of slow (slowCaR) and fast (fastCaR) [Ca²⁺] decay based on the local time constants of decay (TAUlocal). The SD of TAUlocal as a measure of dyssynchrony was not related to the amplitude or the timing of local Ca²⁺ release. Stimulation of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca²⁺ ATPase with forskolin or istaroxime accelerated and its inhibition with cyclopiazonic acid slowed TAUlocal significantly more in slowCaR, thus altering the relationship between SD of TAUlocal and global [Ca²⁺] decay (TAUglobal). Na⁺/Ca²⁺ exchanger inhibitor SEA0400 prolonged TAUlocal similarly in slowCaR and fastCaR. FastCaR were associated with increased mitochondrial density and were more sensitive to the mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uniporter blocker Ru360. Variation in TAUlocal was higher in pig and human cardiomyocytes and higher with increased stimulation frequency (2 Hz). TAUlocal correlated with local sarcomere relengthening. In mice with myocardial hypertrophy after transverse aortic constriction, in pigs with chronic myocardial ischemia, and in end-stage human heart failure, variation in TAUlocal was increased and related to cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and increased mitochondrial density. In cardiomyocytes, cytosolic [Ca²⁺] decay is regulated locally and related to local sarcomere relengthening. Dyssynchronous intracellular [Ca²⁺] decay in cardiac remodeling and end-stage heart failure suggests a novel mechanism of cellular contractile dysfunction.",

    "title": "Timing of myocardial trpm7 deletion during cardiogenesis variably disrupts adult ventricular function, conduction, and repolarization.",
    "abstract": "Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels are a superfamily of broadly expressed ion channels with diverse physiological roles. TRPC1, TRPC3, and TRPC6 are believed to contribute to cardiac hypertrophy in mouse models. Human mutations in TRPM4 have been linked to progressive familial heart block. TRPM7 is a divalent-permeant channel and kinase of unknown function, recently implicated in the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation; however, its function in ventricular myocardium remains unexplored. We generated multiple cardiac-targeted knockout mice to test the hypothesis that TRPM7 is required for normal ventricular function. Early cardiac Trpm7 deletion (before embryonic day 9; TnT/Isl1-Cre) results in congestive heart failure and death by embryonic day 11.5 as a result of hypoproliferation of the compact myocardium. Remarkably, Trpm7 deletion late in cardiogenesis (about embryonic day 13; αMHC-Cre) produces viable mice with normal adult ventricular size, function, and myocardial transcriptional profile. Trpm7 deletion at an intermediate time point results in 50% of mice developing cardiomyopathy associated with heart block, impaired repolarization, and ventricular arrhythmias. Microarray analysis reveals elevations in transcripts of hypertrophy/remodeling genes and reductions in genes important for suppressing hypertrophy (Hdac9) and for ventricular repolarization (Kcnd2) and conduction (Hcn4). These transcriptional changes are accompanied by action potential prolongation and reductions in transient outward current (Ito; Kcnd2). Similarly, the pacemaker current (If; Hcn4) is suppressed in atrioventricular nodal cells, accounting for the observed heart block. Trpm7 is dispensable in adult ventricular myocardium under basal conditions but is critical for myocardial proliferation during early cardiogenesis. Loss of Trpm7 at an intermediate developmental time point alters the myocardial transcriptional profile in adulthood, impairing ventricular function, conduction, and repolarization.",

    "title": "SRC-2 coactivator deficiency decreases functional reserve in response to pressure overload of mouse heart.",
    "abstract": "A major component of the cardiac stress response is the simultaneous activation of several gene regulatory networks. Interestingly, the transcriptional regulator steroid receptor coactivator-2, SRC-2 is often decreased during cardiac failure in humans. We postulated that SRC-2 suppression plays a mechanistic role in the stress response and that SRC-2 activity is an important regulator of the adult heart gene expression profile. Genome-wide microarray analysis, confirmed with targeted gene expression analyses revealed that genetic ablation of SRC-2 activates the \"fetal gene program\" in adult mice as manifested by shifts in expression of a) metabolic and b) sarcomeric genes, as well as associated modulating transcription factors. While these gene expression changes were not accompanied by changes in left ventricular weight or cardiac function, imposition of transverse aortic constriction (TAC) predisposed SRC-2 knockout (KO) mice to stress-induced cardiac dysfunction. In addition, SRC-2 KO mice lacked the normal ventricular hypertrophic response as indicated through heart weight, left ventricular wall thickness, and blunted molecular signaling known to activate hypertrophy. Our results indicate that SRC-2 is involved in maintenance of the steady-state adult heart transcriptional profile, with its ablation inducing transcriptional changes that mimic a stressed heart. These results further suggest that SRC-2 deletion interferes with the timing and integration needed to respond efficiently to stress through disruption of metabolic and sarcomeric gene expression and hypertrophic signaling, the three key stress responsive pathways.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this review was to determine whether past research provides conclusive evidence about the effects of type and timing of ingestion of specific sources of protein by those engaged in resistance weight training. Two essential, nutrition-related, tenets need to be followed by weightlifters to maximize muscle hypertrophy: the consumption of 1.2-2.0 g protein.kg -1 of body weight, and ≥44-50 kcal.kg-1 of body weight. Researchers have tested the effects of timing of protein supplement ingestion on various physical changes in weightlifters. In general, protein supplementation pre- and post-workout increases physical performance, training session recovery, lean body mass, muscle hypertrophy, and strength. Specific gains, differ however based on protein type and amounts. Studies on timing of consumption of milk have indicated that fat-free milk post-workout was effective in promoting increases in lean body mass, strength, muscle hypertrophy and decreases in body fat. The leucine content of a protein source has an impact on protein synthesis, and affects muscle hypertrophy. Consumption of 3-4 g of leucine is needed to promote maximum protein synthesis. An ideal supplement following resistance exercise should contain whey protein that provides at least 3 g of leucine per serving. A combination of a fast-acting carbohydrate source such as maltodextrin or glucose should be consumed with the protein source, as leucine cannot modulate protein synthesis as effectively without the presence of insulin. Such a supplement post-workout would be most effective in increasing muscle protein synthesis, resulting in greater muscle hypertrophy and strength. In contrast, the consumption of essential amino acids and dextrose appears to be most effective at evoking protein synthesis prior to rather than following resistance exercise. To further enhance muscle hypertrophy and strength, a resistance weight- training program of at least 10-12 weeks with compound movements for both upper and lower body exercises should be followed.",

We hypothesized that it might help to detect early disease. NT-proBNP was measured under at rest conditions in 117 patients with AFD (age 48 ± 15 years, 46.2% men). All patients underwent clinical evaluation with electrocardiography and echocardiography. The median NT-proBNP concentration was 24 pmol/L (range <5 to 6,059). Of the 117 patients, 67 (57%) had elevated, age-corrected, NT-proBNP levels. In the 56 patients (48%) with normal echocardiographic findings, the NT-proBNP levels were greater than the age-predicted cutoffs in 10 of 25 patients with abnormal electrocardiographic findings and 3 of 31 patients with normal electrocardiographic findings (p <0.05). On multiple regression analysis, age, creatinine, left atrial volume index, E/Ea, and the presence of abnormal electrocardiographic findings were independently associated with log NT-proBNP (R(2) = 0.67, p <0.05). In conclusion, NT-proBNP concentrations were elevated in patients with AFD and early cardiac involvement, suggesting its measurement could assist in decisions regarding the timing of enzyme replacement therapy.",

    "abstract": "The underlying cause of sarcopenia and dynapenia (age-related strength loss) are not fully elucidated, but may be the result, or combination, of alterations in lifestyle or inflammatory and endocrine profiles. What is clear is that functional ability is limited and mortality risk is elevated. Mechanistically, muscle atrophy is the result of the prolonged periods of net negative muscle protein balance, brought about by the imbalance between muscle protein synthesis (MPS) and muscle protein breakdown (MPB). Contractile loading of skeletal muscle, through resistive-type exercise and amino acid ingestion both act as a strong stimulus for MPS and, when combined, can induce a net positive protein balance and muscle hypertrophy. Given that MPS in older muscles displays a blunted response to anabolic stimuli compared with the young, the combined effect and manipulation of contractile and nutrient interventions to optimize muscle anabolism could be extremely important for counteracting sarcopenia. Specifically, the dose, absorption kinetics, leucine content, but less-so the timing of ingestion, are important determinants of the mRNA translational signalling response regulating MPS. In addition, resistance exercise-induced rates of MPS and hypertrophy appear to be dependent on exercise volume (to achieve maximal muscle fibre recruitment), as opposed to the absolute load that is lifted. A number of recent studies in young adults lend weight to this notion by showing that contraction can be manipulated; allowing low load weight lifting to effectively stimulate rates of MPS to a level comparable with traditional high loads, a finding with important implications for older adults interested in undertaking resistance exercise.",

    "abstract": "Investigate the combination effects of strength training and Botulinum Toxin Type-A (BoNT-A) on muscle strength and morphology in children with Cerebral Palsy (CP). Fifteen children receiving BoNT-A, classified as Spastic Diplegic CP, GMFCS I-II, and aged 5-12 years were recruited for this study. Randomly allocated to 10 weeks of strength training either before or after BoNT-A, children were assessed over 6 months. Eight of the 15 children also completed a control period. The Modified Ashworth Scale measured spasticity. The Goal Attainment Scale (GAS) assessed achievement of functional goals. Magnetic Resonance Imaging assessed muscle volume (MV). Instrumented dynamometry assessed strength. Spasticity was significantly reduced following BoNT-A injection (p = 0.033). Children made significant isokinetic strength gains (mean p = 0.022, ES = 0.57) in the intervention period compared to the control period (mean p = 0.15, ES = 0.56). Irrespective of timing, significant strength improvements were seen immediately (10 weeks) and over 6 months for all children. This was also the case for improvements in the GAS (immediately: mean p = 0.007, ES = 4.17, 6 months: mean p = 0.029, ES = 0.99), and improvements in MV in all assessed muscles. The simultaneous use of BoNT-A and strength training was successful in spasticity reduction, improving strength and achieving functional goals, over and above treatment with BoNT-A alone. Muscles targeted for BoNT-A injection should be included in strength training. Cerebral Palsy• Botulinum toxin type-A (BoNT-A) and strength training are available interventions that, on their own have found success in managing spasticity and muscle weakness (both significant motor impairments), respectively in children with Cerebral Palsy (CP). • This study has demonstrated that the concurrent treatment of BoNT-A and strength training can achieve positive outcomes in terms of strength, spasticity and for the achievement of set functional goals. • The results of this study show that the improved muscle strength can be associated with hypertrophy, which could indicate the potential role of strength training in altering the rate of muscle growth, in an aim to improve the failure of muscle growth associated with CP. • Home based strength training, based on a child's individual goals is shown to be successful in improving strength and goal attainment for children with CP.",

    "title": "Gq/11-mediated signaling and hypertrophy in mice with cardiac-specific transgenic expression of regulator of G-protein signaling 2.",
    "abstract": "Cardiac hypertrophy is a well-established risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Activation of G(q/11)-mediated signaling is required for pressure overload-induced cardiomyocyte (CM) hypertrophy to develop. We previously showed that among Regulators of G protein Signaling, RGS2 selectively inhibits G(q/11) signaling and its hypertrophic effects in isolated CM. In this study, we generated transgenic mice with CM-specific, conditional RGS2 expression (dTG) to investigate whether RGS2 overexpression can be used to attenuate G(q/11)-mediated signaling and hypertrophy in vivo. Transverse aortic constriction (TAC) induced a comparable rise in ventricular mass and ANF expression and corresponding hemodynamic changes in dTG compared to wild types (WT), regardless of the TAC duration (1-8 wks) and timing of RGS2 expression (from birth or adulthood). Inhibition of endothelin-1-induced G(q/11)-mediated phospholipase C β activity in ventricles and atrial appendages indicated functionality of transgenic RGS2. However, the inhibitory effect of transgenic RGS2 on G(q/11)-mediated PLCβ activation differed between ventricles and atria: (i) in sham-operated dTG mice the magnitude of the inhibitory effect was less pronounced in ventricles than in atria, and (ii) after TAC, negative regulation of G(q/11) signaling was absent in ventricles but fully preserved in atria. Neither difference could be explained by differences in expression levels, including marked RGS2 downregulation after TAC in left ventricle and atrium. Counter-regulatory changes in other G(q/11)-regulating RGS proteins (RGS4, RGS5, RGS6) and random insertion were also excluded as potential causes. Taken together, despite ample evidence for a role of RGS2 in negatively regulating G(q/11) signaling and hypertrophy in CM, CM-specific RGS2 overexpression in transgenic mice in vivo did not lead to attenuate ventricular G(q/11)-mediated signaling and hypertrophy in response to pressure overload. Furthermore, our study suggests chamber-specific differences in the regulation of RGS2 functionality and potential future utility of the new transgenic model in mitigating G(q/11) signaling in the atria in vivo.",

    "title": "Advances in research on the prenatal development of skeletal muscle in animals in relation to the quality of muscle-based food. I. Regulation of myogenesis and environmental impact.",
    "abstract": "Skeletal muscle development in vertebrates - also termed myogenesis - is a highly integrated process. Evidence to date indicates that the processes are very similar across mammals, poultry and fish, although the timings of the various steps differ considerably. Myogenesis is regulated by the myogenic regulatory factors and consists of two to three distinct phases when different fibre populations appear. The critical times when myogenesis is prone to hormonal or environmental influences depend largely on the developmental stage. One of the main mechanisms for both genetic and environmental effects on muscle fibre development is via the direct action of the growth hormone-insulin-like growth factor (GH-IGF) axis. In mammals and poultry, postnatal growth and function of muscles relate mainly to the hypertrophy of the fibres formed during myogenesis and to their fibre-type composition in terms of metabolic and contractile properties, whereas in fish hyperplasia still plays a major role. Candidate genes that are important in skeletal muscle development, for instance, encode for IGFs and IGF-binding proteins, myosin heavy chain isoforms, troponin T, myosin light chain and others have been identified. In mammals, nutritional supply in utero affects myogenesis and the GH-IGF axis may have an indirect action through the partitioning of nutrients towards the gravid uterus. Impaired myogenesis resulting in low skeletal myofibre numbers is considered one of the main reasons for negative long-term consequences of intrauterine growth retardation. Severe undernutrition in utero due to natural variation in litter or twin-bearing species or insufficient maternal nutrient supply may impair myogenesis and adversely affect carcass quality later in terms of reduced lean and increased fat deposition in the progeny. On the other hand, increases in maternal feed intake above standard requirement seem to have no beneficial effects on the growth of the progeny with myogenesis not or only slightly affected. Initial studies on low and high maternal protein feeding are published. Although there are only a few studies, first results also reveal an influence of nutrition on skeletal muscle development in fish and poultry. Finally, environmental temperature has been identified as a critical factor for growth and development of skeletal muscle in both fish and poultry.",

    "abstract": "Intact protein, protein hydrolysates, and free amino acids are popular ingredients in contemporary sports nutrition, and have been suggested to augment post-exercise recovery. Protein and/or amino acid ingestion stimulates skeletal muscle protein synthesis, inhibits protein breakdown and, as such, stimulates muscle protein accretion following resistance and endurance type exercise. This has been suggested to lead to a greater adaptive response to each successive exercise bout, resulting in more effective muscle reconditioning. Despite limited evidence, some basic guidelines can be defined regarding the preferred type, amount, and timing of dietary protein that should be ingested to maximize post-exercise muscle protein accretion. Whey protein seems most effective in stimulating muscle protein synthesis during acute post-exercise recovery. This is likely attributable to its rapid digestion and absorption kinetics and specific amino acid composition. Ingestion of approximately 20 g protein during and/or immediately after exercise is sufficient to maximize post-exercise muscle protein synthesis rates. Coingestion of a large amount of carbohydrate or free leucine is not warranted to further augment post- exercise muscle protein synthesis when ample protein is already ingested. Future research should focus on the relevance of the acute anabolic response following exercise to optimize the skeletal muscle adaptive response to exercise training.",

    "abstract": "Muscle protein synthesis (MPS) is the driving force behind adaptive responses to exercise and represents a widely adopted proxy for gauging chronic efficacy of acute interventions, (i.e. exercise/nutrition). Recent findings in this arena have been progressive. Nutrient-driven increases in MPS are of finite duration (∼1.5 h), switching off thereafter despite sustained amino acid availability and intramuscular anabolic signalling. Intriguingly, this 'muscle-full set-point' is delayed by resistance exercise (RE) (i.e. the feeding × exercise combination is 'more anabolic' than nutrition alone) even 24 h beyond a single exercise bout, casting doubt on the importance of nutrient timing vs. sufficiency per se. Studies manipulating exercise intensity/workload have shown that increases in MPS are negligible with RE at 20-40% but maximal at 70-90% of one-repetition maximum when workload is matched (according to load × repetition number). However, low-intensity exercise performed to failure equalises this response. Analysing distinct subcellular fractions (e.g. myofibrillar, sarcoplasmic, mitochondrial) may provide a readout of chronic exercise efficacy in addition to effect size in MPS per se, i.e. while 'mixed' MPS increases similarly with endurance and RE, increases in myofibrillar MPS are specific to RE, prophetic of adaptation (i.e. hypertrophy). Finally, the molecular regulation of MPS by exercise and its regulation via 'anabolic' hormones (e.g. IGF-1) has been questioned, leading to discovery of alternative mechanosensing-signalling to MPS.",

    "title": "Inhalation of hydrogen gas attenuates left ventricular remodeling induced by intermittent hypoxia in mice.",
    "abstract": "Sleep apnea syndrome increases the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. We previously reported that intermittent hypoxia increases superoxide production in a manner dependent on nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate and accelerates adverse left ventricular (LV) remodeling. Recent studies have suggested that hydrogen (H(2)) may have an antioxidant effect by reducing hydroxyl radicals. In this study, we investigated the effects of H(2) gas inhalation on lipid metabolism and LV remodeling induced by intermittent hypoxia in mice. Male C57BL/6J mice (n = 62) were exposed to intermittent hypoxia (repetitive cycle of 1-min periods of 5 and 21% oxygen for 8 h during daytime) for 7 days. H(2) gas (1.3 vol/100 vol) was given either at the time of reoxygenation, during hypoxic conditions, or throughout the experimental period. Mice kept under normoxic conditions served as controls (n = 13). Intermittent hypoxia significantly increased plasma levels of low- and very low-density cholesterol and the amount of 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal-modified protein adducts in the LV myocardium. It also upregulated mRNA expression of tissue necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, and brain natriuretic peptide, increased production of superoxide, and induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, nuclear deformity, mitochondrial degeneration, and interstitial fibrosis. H(2) gas inhalation significantly suppressed these changes induced by intermittent hypoxia. In particular, H(2) gas inhaled at the timing of reoxygenation or throughout the experiment was effective in preventing dyslipidemia and suppressing superoxide production in the LV myocardium. These results suggest that inhalation of H(2) gas was effective for reducing oxidative stress and preventing LV remodeling induced by intermittent hypoxia relevant to sleep apnea.",

    "abstract": "Left ventricular (LV) reverse remodelling after valve replacement in aortic stenosis (AS) has been classically linked to the hydraulic performance of the replacement device, but myocardial status at the time of surgery has received little attention. To establish predictors of LV mass (LVM) regression 1 year after valve replacement in a surgical cohort of patients with AS based on preoperative clinical and echocardiographic parameters and the myocardial gene expression profile at surgery. Transcript levels of remodelling-related proteins and regulators were determined in LV intraoperative biopsies from 46 patients with AS by RT-PCR. Using multiple linear regression analysis, an equation was developed (adjusted R²=0.73; p<0.0001) that included positive [preoperative LVM, microRNA-133a, serum response factor (SRF, which is known to be a transactivator of miR-133) and age] and negative [body mass index (BMI), Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome candidate-2 (WHSC2, which is a target for repression by miR-133a), β-myosin heavy chain, myosin light chain-2, diabetes mellitus, and male gender] independent predictors of LVM reduction. Aortic valve area gain or the reduction in transvalvular gradient maintained no significant relationships with the dependent variable. Logistic regression analysis identified microRNA-133a as a significant positive predictor of LVM normalisation, whereas β-myosin heavy chain and BMI constituted negative predictors. Hypertrophy regression 1 year after pressure overload release is related to the preoperative myocardial expression of remodelling-related genes, in conjunction with the patient's clinical background. In this scenario, miR-133 emerges as a key element of the reverse remodelling process. Postoperative improvement of valve haemodynamics does not predict the degree of hypertrophy regression or LVM normalisation. These results led us to reconsider the current reverse remodelling paradigm and (1) to include criteria of hypertrophy reversibility in the decision algorithm used to decide timing for the operation; and (2) to modify other prevailing factors (overweight, diabetes, etc) known to maintain LV hypertrophy.",

    "abstract": "Calcium ions (Ca²(+)) play an essential role in homeostasis and the activity of cardiovascular cells. Ca²(+) influx across the plasma membrane induced by neurohumoral factors or mechanical stress elicits physiologically relevant timing and spatial patterns of Ca²(+) signaling, which leads to the activation of various cardiovascular functions, such as muscle contraction, gene expression, and hypertrophic growth of myocytes. A canonical transient receptor potential protein subfamily member, TRPC6, which is activated by diacylglycerol and mechanical stretch, works as an upstream regulator of the Ca²(+) signaling pathway required for pathological hypertrophy. We have recently found that the inhibition of cGMP-selective phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) suppresses agonist- and mechanical stretch-induced hypertrophy through inhibition of Ca²(+) influx in rat cardiomyocytes. The inhibition of PDE5 suppressed the increase in frequency of Ca²(+) spikes induced by receptor stimulation or mechanical stretch. Activation of protein kinase G by PDE5 inhibition phosphorylated TRPC6 proteins at Thr⁶⁹ and prevented TRPC6-mediated Ca²(+) influx. Substitution of Ala for Thr⁶⁹ in TRPC6 abolished the antihypertrophic effects of PDE5 inhibition. These results suggest that phosphorylation and functional suppression of TRPC6 underlies the prevention of cardiac hypertrophy by PDE5 inhibition. As TRPC6 proteins are also expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells and reportedly participate in vascular remodeling, TRPC6 blockade may be an effective therapeutic strategy for preventing pathologic cardiovascular remodeling.",

    "title": "Steroid use and human performance: Lessons for integrative biologists.",
    "abstract": "While recent studies have begun to address how hormones mediate whole-animal performance traits, the field conspicuously lags behind research conducted on humans. Recent studies of human steroid use have revealed that steroid use increases muscle cross-sectional area and mass, largely due to increases in protein synthesis, and muscle fiber hypertrophy attributable to an increased number of satellite cells and myonuclei per unit area. These biochemical and cellular effects on skeletal muscle morphology translate into increased power and work during weight-lifting and enhanced performance in burst, sprinting activities. However, there are no unequivocal data that human steroid use enhances endurance performance or muscle fatigability or recovery. The effects of steroids on human morphology and performance are in general consistent with results found for nonhuman animals, though there are notable discrepancies. However, some of the discrepancies may be due to a paucity of comparative data on how testosterone affects muscle physiology and subsequent performance across different regions of the body and across vertebrate taxa. Therefore, we advocate more research on the basic relationships among hormones, morphology, and performance. Based on results from human studies, we recommend that integrative biologists interested in studying hormone regulation of performance should take into account training, timing of administration, and dosage administered when designing experiments or field studies. We also argue that more information is needed on the long-term effects of hormone manipulation on performance and fitness.",

    "abstract": "Cardiac disease causes considerable morbidity and mortality in men and women with Anderson-Fabry disease (AFD), an X-linked inborn metabolic defect caused by deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme α-galactosidase A. Treatment with recombinant enzyme preparations aims to attenuate and reverse accumulation of the major enzyme substrate, globotriaosylceramide (Gb3). Pathologic data examining the effect of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) in vivo are scant. A detailed examination of three whole hearts from patients (all male, aged 55, 59, 73 years) with AFD that had received ERT prior to death (for between 18 months and 4 years) was performed. In spite of ERT, Gb3 accumulation was present in myocytes, within both atria and ventricles, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, coronary arteries, aorta, and valve tissue. Nearly all myocytes within the right and left ventricles were hypertrophied with marked vacuolization of the cytoplasm. In all three cases, there was focal myocyte apoptosis and myocyte necrosis associated with macrophage accumulation and a small T-lymphocytic infiltrate. Extensive areas of replacement fibrosis (mean, 15%) associated with areas of myocyte disarray were present in all three hearts. This study highlights the pancardiac nature of AFD; demonstrates the extent of fibrotic changes; and reports, for the first time, myocyte disarray, necrosis, and apoptosis in hearts from patients affected by AFD and receiving ERT. These findings have major implications for the timing and efficacy of ERT in AFD.",

    "abstract": "Following pulmonary artery banding (PAB), the contractile function of right ventricle diminishes over time. Subsequently, the right atrium (RA) has to contract against a higher afterload, but it is unknown to what extent ventricular dysfunction has an effect on the atrial contractility. We hypothesized that right ventricular pressure overload may have an affect on atrial contractility and Ca(2+) transport protein expression. Therefore, we induced pressure overload of the right ventricle by PAB for 10 wk in rabbits and examined the changes in the expression of Ca(2+) transport proteins in the atrium. We demonstrate that PAB significantly decreased the expression of sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (Serca) 2a while expression of Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger-1 was significantly upregulated in the RA but not in the left atria of rabbit hearts, indicating that pressure is the major trigger. A decrease in Serca2a expression was concomitant with a significant decrease in sarcolipin (SLN), possibly indicating a compensatory role of SLN. The decreased expression of SLN was unable to completely restore sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) uptake function of Serca2a. Functional contractile assessments in isolated trabeculae showed no difference between PAB- and sham-operated rabbits at 1 Hz but displayed an enhanced force development at higher frequencies and in the presence of isoproterenol, while twitch timing was unaffected. Our results indicate that right ventricular mechanical overload due to PAB affects the expression of the Ca(2+)-handling proteins in the RA in rabbits.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in X-linked lysosome-associated membrane protein gene (LAMP2; Danon disease) produce a cardiomyopathy in young patients that clinically mimics severe hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) due to sarcomere protein mutations. However, the natural history and phenotypic expression of this newly recognized disease is incompletely resolved and its identification may have important clinical implications. To determine the clinical consequences, outcome, and phenotypic expression of LAMP2 cardiomyopathy associated with diagnostic and management strategies. Clinical course and outcome were assessed prospectively in 7 young patients (6 boys) with defined LAMP2 mutations from the time of diagnosis (age 7-17 years; median, 14 years) to October 2008. Phenotypic expression of this disease was assessed both clinically and at autopsy. Progressive heart failure, cardiac death, and transplant. Over a mean (SD) follow-up of 8.6 (2.6) years, and by age 14 to 24 years, the study patients developed left ventricular systolic dysfunction (mean [SD] ejection fraction, 25% [7%]) and cavity enlargement, as well as particularly adverse clinical consequences, including progressive refractory heart failure and death (n = 4), sudden death (n = 1), aborted cardiac arrest (n = 1), or heart transplantation (n = 1). Left ventricular hypertrophy was particularly marked (maximum thickness, 29-65 mm; mean [SD], 44 [15] mm), including 2 patients with massive ventricular septal thickness of 60 mm and 65 mm at ages 23 and 14 years, respectively. In 6 patients, a ventricular pre-excitation pattern at study entry was associated with markedly increased voltages of R-wave or S-wave (15-145 mm; mean [SD], 69 [39] mm), and deeply inverted T-waves. Autopsy findings included a combination of histopathologic features that were consistent with a lysosomal storage disease (ie, clusters of vacuolated myocytes) but also typical of HCM due to sarcomere protein mutations (ie, myocyte disarray, small vessel disease, myocardial scarring). LAMP2 cardiomyopathy is a profound disease process characterized by progressive clinical deterioration leading rapidly to cardiac death in young patients (<25 years). These observations underscore the importance of timely molecular diagnosis for predicting prognosis and early consideration of heart transplantation.",

    "abstract": "Skeletal muscle constitutes a highly adaptable and malleable tissue that responds to environmental and physiological challenges by changing its phenotype in terms of size and composition, outcomes that are brought about by changes in gene expression, biochemical and metabolic properties. Both the short- and long-term effects of nutritional alterations on skeletal muscle homeostasis have been defined as the object of intensive research over the last thirty years. This review focuses predominantly on assimilating our understanding of the changes in muscle fibre phenotype and functional properties induced by either food restriction or alternatively existing on a high fat diet. Firstly, food restriction has been shown in a number of studies to decrease the myofibre cross sectional area and consistently, it has been found that glycolytic type IIB fibres are more prone to atrophy than oxidative fibres. Secondly, in rodents, a high fat diet has been shown to induce an oxidative profile in skeletal muscle, although obese humans usually show higher numbers of glycolytic type IIB fibres. Moreover, attention is paid to the effect of prenatal maternal food restriction on muscle development of the offspring in various species. A key point related to these experiments is the timing of food restriction for the mother. Furthermore, we explore extensively the seemingly species-specific response to maternal malnutrition. Finally, key signalling molecules that play a pivotal role in energy metabolism, fibre type transitions and muscle hypertrophy are discussed in detail.",

    "abstract": "The aim of our study was to find out, whether cardiomyocyte genome duplication participates in developmental programming of adult hypertension and impaired heart aerobic capacity, and if it does, whether ploidy-related programming is reversible and what are the timeframes of the most critical window. For this propose we studied the effect of the well-known factors of programming, including growth retardation, infection, and cardiac overload on the level of neonatal cardiomyocyte ploidy, protein content and shape. Using the model of rat cryptosporidial gastroenteritis, we shifted the time point of infection day by day through the neonatal period and traced the immediate and postponed effects of disease on isolated cardiomyocyte ploidy, phenotype, and protein content. We found that gastroenteritis caused cardiac atrophy and a burst-like premature genome accumulation, elongation, narrowing and protein loss in the cardiomyocytes. These changes resulted in sharp increase of DNA content at the expense of contractile proteins. We also revealed clear indications of critical window of heart development during the peak of cardiomyocyte transition from proliferation to hypertrophy. After the rehabilitation, the atrophy of heart and cardiomyocyte remodelling showed a conspicuous restoration, whereas the hyperpolyploidization did not regress. An irreversible manner of excessive genome duplication and its well-known ability to alter gene expression confirm our suggestion that it is implicated in the ontogenetic programming of heart development. We provided the first evidence that developmental programming can operate through cardiomyocyte genome duplication and that the critical window coincides with cell transition from proliferation to hypertrophy. Our data help determine the timing of critical window for human heart and would allow successful prevention of human cardiac abnormalities even before they become tangible.",

    "abstract": "Muscle contraction during exercise, whether resistive or endurance in nature, has profound affects on muscle protein turnover that can persist for up to 72 h. It is well established that feeding during the postexercise period is required to bring about a positive net protein balance (muscle protein synthesis - muscle protein breakdown). There is mounting evidence that the timing of ingestion and the protein source during recovery independently regulate the protein synthetic response and influence the extent of muscle hypertrophy. Minor differences in muscle protein turnover appear to exist in young men and women; however, with aging there may be more substantial sex-based differences in response to both feeding and resistance exercise. The recognition of anabolic signaling pathways and molecules are also enhancing our understanding of the regulation of protein turnover following exercise perturbations. In this review we summarize the current understanding of muscle protein turnover in response to exercise and feeding and highlight potential sex-based dimorphisms. Furthermore, we examine the underlying anabolic signaling pathways and molecules that regulate these processes.",

    "abstract": "The validity of genotype:phenotype correlation studies in human hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) has recently been questioned, yet animal models and in vitro studies suggest distinct effects for different mutations. The aims of this study were to investigate whether distinct HCM-mutations have different consequences for cardiac structure and function in the absence of the confounding effects of hypertrophy. Individuals aged 20-65 belonging to 21 R92W(TNNT2), R403W(MYH7), or A797T(MYH7) mutation-bearing families were investigated with 2D, M-mode, and Doppler echocardiography. Cardiac structural and functional parameters were compared between prehypertrophic mutation-carriers and their non-carrier family members, with concomitant adjustment for appropriate covariates. Findings were evaluated against existing animal and in vitro functional data. The distinct functional effect of the R92W(TNNT) mutation was a relative increase in systolic functional parameters, that of the A797T(MYH7) mutation was reduced diastolic function, while the R403W(MYH7) mutation reduced both systolic and diastolic function. The observed early effects of the R92W(TNNT2) mutation mechanistically fit with prolonged force-transients precipitated by increased Ca(2+) sensitivity of the thin filament, and that of the MYH7 mutations with local ATP depletion. Evaluation of the impact of the mutations on cardiac structure and function in prehypertrophic mutation-carriers, relative to the baseline norm provided by their non-carrier family members, best recapitulated existing animal and in vitro functional data, while inclusion of mutation-carriers with hypertrophy obscured such findings. The results prompt speculation that timely treatment aimed at ameliorating Ca(2+) sensitivity for R92W(TNNT2)-carriers, and energy depletion for MYH7 mutation-carriers, may offer a plausible approach for preventing progression from a preclinical into a decompensated state.",

    "title": "Application of cellular mechanisms to growth and development of food producing animals.",
    "abstract": "Postnatal skeletal muscle growth is a result of hypertrophy of existing skeletal muscle fibers in food producing animals. Accumulation of additional nuclei, as a source of DNA, to the multinucleated skeletal muscle fiber aids in fiber hypertrophy during periods of rapid skeletal muscle growth. Muscle satellite cells are recognized as the source of nuclei to support muscle hypertrophy. Exogenous growth-enhancing compounds have been used to modulate growth rate and efficiency in meat animals for over a half century. In cattle, these compounds enhance efficiency of growth by preferentially stimulating skeletal muscle growth compared with adipose tissue. There are 2 main classes of compounds approved for use in cattle in the United States, anabolic steroids and beta-adrenergic agonists (beta-AA). Administration of both trenbolone acetate and estradiol-17beta, as implants, increased carcass protein accumulation 8 to 10% in yearling steers. Muscle satellite cells isolated from steers implanted with trenbolone acetate/ estradiol-17beta had a shorter lag phase in culture compared with satellite cells isolated from control steers. Collectively, these data indicate that activation, increased proliferation, and subsequent fusion of satellite cells in muscles of implanted cattle may be an important mechanism by which anabolic steroids enhance muscle hypertrophy. Oral administration of beta-AA to ruminants does not alter DNA accumulation in skeletal muscle over a typical feeding period (28 to 42 d). Enhanced muscle hypertrophy observed due to beta-AA feeding occurs by direct, receptor-mediated changes in protein synthesis and degradation rates of skeletal muscle tissue. Proper timing of anabolic steroid administration when coupled with beta-AA feeding could result in a synergistic response in skeletal muscle growth due to the effects of anabolic steroids at increasing satellite cell activity, which then can support the rapid hypertrophic changes of the muscle fiber when exposed to beta-AA. At the same time each of these classes of compounds are stimulating lean tissue deposition, they appear to repress adipogenesis in meat animals. Increased knowledge of the mechanism by which growth promoters regulate lean tissue deposition and adipogenesis in meat animals will allow for effective application of these techniques to optimize lean tissue growth and minimize the negative effects on meat quality.",

    "title": "Role of protein and hydrolysates before exercise.",
    "abstract": "Adaptations to exercise training are determined by the response of metabolic and molecular mechanisms that determine changes in proteins. The type, intensity, and duration of exercise, as well as nutrition, determine these responses. The importance of protein, in the form of intact proteins, hydrolysates, or free amino acids, for exercise adaptations is widely recognized. Exercise along with protein intake results in accumulation of proteins that influence training adaptations. The total amount of protein necessary to optimize adaptations is less important than the type of protein, timing of protein intake, and the other nutrients ingested concurrently with the protein. Acute metabolic studies offer an important tool to study the responses of protein balance to various exercise and nutritional interventions. Recent studies suggest that ingestion of free amino acids plus carbohydrates before exercise results in a superior anabolic response to exercise than if ingested after exercise. However, the difference between pre-and postexercise ingestion of intact proteins is not apparent. Thus, the anabolic response to exercise plus protein ingestion seems to be determined by the interaction of timing of nutrient intake in relation to exercise and the nutrients ingested. More research is necessary to delineate the optimal combination of nutrients and timing for various types of training adaptations. Protein and amino acid intake have long been deemed important for athletes and exercising individuals. Olympic athletes, from the legendary Milo to many in the 1936 Berlin games, reportedly consumed large amounts of protein. Modern athletes may consume slightly less than these historical figures, yet protein is deemed extremely important by most. Protein is important as a source of amino acids for recovery from exercise and repair of damaged tissues, as well as for adaptations to exercise training, such as muscle hypertrophy and mitochondrial biogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Protein ingestion and exercise stimulate myofibrillar protein synthesis rates. When combined, exercise further increases the postprandial rise in myofibrillar protein synthesis rates. It remains unclear whether protein ingestion with or without exercise also stimulates muscle connective tissue protein synthesis rates. The authors assessed the impact of presleep protein ingestion on overnight muscle connective tissue protein synthesis rates at rest and during recovery from resistance-type exercise in older men. Thirty-six healthy, older men were randomly assigned to ingest 40 g intrinsically L-[1-13C]-phenylalanine and L-[1-13C]-leucine-labeled casein protein (PRO, n = 12) or a nonprotein placebo (PLA, n = 12) before going to sleep. A third group performed a single bout of resistance-type exercise in the evening before ingesting 40 g intrinsically-labeled casein protein prior to sleep (EX+PRO, n = 12). Continuous intravenous infusions of L-[ring-2H5]-phenylalanine and L-[1-13C]-leucine were applied with blood and muscle tissue samples collected throughout overnight sleep. Presleep protein ingestion did not increase muscle connective tissue protein synthesis rates (0.049 ± 0.013 vs. 0.060 ± 0.024%/hr in PLA and PRO, respectively; p = .73). Exercise plus protein ingestion resulted in greater overnight muscle connective tissue protein synthesis rates (0.095 ± 0.022%/hr) when compared with PLA and PRO (p < .01). Exercise increased the incorporation of dietary protein-derived amino acids into muscle connective tissue protein (0.036 ± 0.013 vs. 0.054 ± 0.009 mole percent excess in PRO vs. EX+PRO, respectively; p < .01). In conclusion, resistance-type exercise plus presleep protein ingestion increases overnight muscle connective tissue protein synthesis rates in older men. Exercise enhances the utilization of dietary protein-derived amino acids as precursors for de novo muscle connective tissue protein synthesis during overnight sleep.",

Powdered infant formula samples were extracted in a buffer of sodium deoxycholate and ammonium bicarbonate at 60°C and filtered through 7 kDa desalting columns. Samples were digested overnight with trypsin and precipitated with acid prior to analysis of marker peptides by tandem mass spectrometry. Based on three marker peptides, the linear range for casein was 1.8-42 μg/g of powdered infant formula with an LOQ of 1.8 μg/g. The determination coefficients (R2) for each curve were ≥0.99 for casein peptides. Method repeatability was ≤22% RSD and intermediate precision was ≤23% RSD; recovery of casein from incurred material (2-20 µg/g) ranged from 78% to 118%. An LC-MS/MS method was developed and validated for confirmation of casein allergens in hypoallergenic infant formula. A method was developed to accurately and reliably quantify casein allergens in extensively hydrolyzed casein infant formula by LC-MS without the need for custom peptide standards.",

    "abstract": "The timing of protein intake over the day on muscle mass and strength gains have received interest in the literature. Thus, the aim of this systematic review is to analyze clinical studies that evaluated the acute effects of pre-sleep protein consumption on overnight muscle protein synthesis and the chronic effects on muscle mass and strength. Systematic review. A literature search was conducted up to June 2020 according to PRISMA statement and nine articles were included to analyze. The consumption of 20-40 g of casein approximately 30 min before sleep stimulates whole-body protein synthesis rates over a subsequent overnight period in young and elderly men (preceded or not by resistance exercise, respectively). In addition, pre-sleep protein consumption can augment the muscle adaptive response (muscle fiber cross-sectional area, strength and muscle mass) during 10-12 weeks of resistance exercise in young, but not in elderly men. Based on current evidence, the consumption of 20-40 g of casein approximately 30 min before sleep improves protein synthetic response during an overnight recovery period in healthy young adult men, with possible positive effects on muscle mass and strength following prolonged resistance exercise. In elderly, despite the initial evidence regarding the pre-sleep protein enhances overnight muscle protein synthesis rates, the current available evidence is limited precluding to conclude about the chronic effects on skeletal muscle mass or strength. These conclusions need to be taken with caution due to uneven protein intakes between experimental groups. Therefore, more data are needed before further considering pre-sleep protein as an effective nutritional intervention.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to assess the effect of dietary protein ingestion on intramuscular connective tissue protein synthesis rates during overnight recovery from a single bout of resistance exercise. Thirty-six healthy, young males were randomly assigned to one of three treatments. One group ingested 30 g intrinsically L-[1-C]-phenylalanine-labeled casein protein before sleep (PRO, n = 12). The other two groups performed a bout of resistance exercise in the evening and ingested either placebo (EX, n = 12) or 30 g intrinsically L-[1-C]-phenylalanine-labeled casein protein before sleep (EX + PRO, n = 12). Continuous intravenous infusions of L-[ring-H5]-phenylalanine and L-[1-C]-leucine were applied, and blood and muscle tissue samples were collected to assess connective tissue protein synthesis rates and dietary protein-derived amino acid incorporation in the connective tissue protein fraction. Resistance exercise resulted in higher connective tissue protein synthesis rates when compared with rest (0.086 ± 0.017%·h [EX] and 0.080 ± 0.019%·h [EX + PRO] vs 0.059 ± 0.016%·h [PRO]; P < 0.05). Postexercise casein protein ingestion did not result in higher connective tissue protein synthesis rates when compared with postexercise placebo ingestion (P = 1.00). Dietary protein-derived amino acids were incorporated into the connective tissue protein fraction at rest, and to a greater extent during recovery from exercise (P = 0.002). Resistance exercise increases intramuscular connective tissue protein synthesis rates during overnight sleep, with no further effect of postexercise protein ingestion. However, dietary protein-derived amino acids are being used as precursors to support de novo connective tissue protein synthesis.",

    "abstract": "Exercise is one of the external factors associated with impairment of intestinal integrity, possibly leading to increased permeability and altered absorption. Here, we aimed to examine to what extent endurance exercise in the glycogen-depleted state can affect intestinal permeability toward small molecules and protein-derived peptides in relation to markers of intestinal function. Eleven well-trained male volunteers (27 ± 4 years) ingested 40 g of casein protein and a lactulose/rhamnose (L/R) solution after an overnight fast in resting conditions (control) and after completing a dual - glycogen depletion and endurance - exercise protocol (first protocol execution). The entire procedure was repeated 1 week later (second protocol execution). Intestinal permeability was measured as L/R ratio in 5 h urine and 1 h plasma. Five-hour urine excretion of betacasomorphin-7 (BCM7), postprandial plasma amino acid levels, plasma fatty acid binding protein 2 (FABP-2), serum pre-haptoglobin 2 (preHP2), plasma glucagon-like peptide 2 (GLP2), serum calprotectin, and dipeptidylpeptidase-4 (DPP4) activity were studied as markers for excretion, intestinal functioning and recovery, inflammation, and BCM7 breakdown activity, respectively. BCM7 levels in urine were increased following the dual exercise protocol, in the first as well as the second protocol execution, whereas 1 h-plasma L/R ratio was increased only following the first exercise protocol execution. FABP2, preHP2, and GLP2 were not changed after exercise, whereas calprotectin increased. Plasma citrulline levels following casein ingestion (iAUC) did not increase after exercise, as opposed to resting conditions. Endurance exercise in the glycogen depleted state resulted in a clear increase of BCM7 accumulation in urine, independent of DPP4 activity and intestinal permeability. Therefore, strenuous exercise could have an effect on the amount of food-derived bioactive peptides crossing the epithelial barrier. The health consequence of increased passage needs more in depth studies.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine the influence of the somatic cell content (SCC) of milk on Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese yield, produced in commercial cheese factories under field conditions. The study was carried out following the production of 56 batches of Parmigiano-Reggiano in 13 commercial cheese factories by processing milk collected from Italian Friesian cattle herds. The vat-milk (V-milk) used for making each cheese batch was obtained by mixing evening milk (partially skimmed following spontaneous separation of fat overnight, natural creaming) and morning milk. The batches of cheese produced were divided into 5 classes according to the SCC value of the evening milk determined prior to natural creaming (class 1, from 0 to 200,000; 2, 201,000-300,000; 3, 301,000-400,000; 4, 401,000-500,000; 5, over 501,000 cells/ml). The cheese yield was calculated as the amount of 24-h cheese, expressed in kilograms, obtained from 100 kg of V-milk (24 h ACY). The values of fat, crude protein, true protein, casein and 24 h ACY of V-milk were negatively correlated with the somatic cell score (SCS) of the evening milk. Conversely, a positive correlation was observed between chloride and SCS. Fat, protein fractions (crude protein, casein and whey proteins), P and titratable acidity of V-milk were positively correlated with its 24 h ACY, while chloride, pH and SCS showed a negative correlation. A significant drop in 24 h ACY was observed in classes 3, 4 and 5, therefore when the SCC of the evening milk exceeded 300,000 cells/ml. Finally a lower recovery of milk fat in cheese was observed as SCC of evening milk increase.",

    "abstract": "In this study, a novel method for the highly selective enrichment of phosphopeptides using erbium phosphate doped poly(glycidyl methacrylate/ethylene dimethacrylate) spin columns is presented. Erbium phosphate was synthesized by precipitation from boiling phosphoric acid and incubated overnight in erbium chloride solutions. The resulting powder was embedded in a monolithic poly(glycidyl methacrylate/ethylene dimethacrylate) polymer. The monolith was synthesized in a spin column by radical polymerization. Erbium phosphate demonstrated a high affinity and selectivity for phosphopeptides due to the strong interaction of trivalent erbium ions with the phosphate groups of phosphopeptides. The high selectivity and performance of the designed spin columns were demonstrated by successfully enriching phosphopeptides from tryptically digested protein mixtures containing the model phosphoproteins α- and β-casein, bovine milk, and human saliva. By the implementation of several washing steps, unspecific components were removed and the enriched phosphopeptides were effectively eluted from the spin columns under alkaline conditions. The selective performance of the presented method was further demonstrated by the enrichment of two synthetic phosphopeptides, which were spiked in tryptically digested and dephosphorylated HeLa cell lysates at low ratios. Finally, the presented approach was compared to conventional phosphopeptide enrichment by titanium oxide and revealed higher recoveries for the erbium phosphate doped monoliths.",

    "abstract": "The role of nutrition in modulating postexercise overnight recovery remains to be elucidated. We assessed the effect of protein ingestion immediately before sleep on digestion and absorption kinetics and protein metabolism during overnight recovery from a single bout of resistance-type exercise. Sixteen healthy young males performed a single bout of resistance-type exercise in the evening (2000 h) after a full day of dietary standardization. All subjects were provided with appropriate recovery nutrition (20 g of protein, 60 g of CHO) immediately after exercise (2100 h). Thereafter, 30 min before sleep (2330 h), subjects ingested a beverage with (PRO) or without (PLA) 40 g of specifically produced intrinsically [1-C]phenylalanine-labeled casein protein. Continuous intravenous infusions with [ring-H5]phenylalanine and [ring-H2]tyrosine were applied with blood and muscle samples collected to assess protein digestion and absorption kinetics, whole-body protein balance and mixed muscle protein synthesis rates throughout the night (7.5 h). During sleep, casein protein was effectively digested and absorbed resulting in a rapid rise in circulating amino acid levels, which were sustained throughout the remainder of the night. Protein ingestion before sleep increased whole-body protein synthesis rates (311 ± 8 vs 246 ± 9 μmol·kg per 7.5 h) and improved net protein balance (61 ± 5 vs -11 ± 6 μmol·kg per 7.5 h) in the PRO vs the PLA experiment (P < 0.01). Mixed muscle protein synthesis rates were ∼22% higher in the PRO vs the PLA experiment, which reached borderline significance (0.059%·h ± 0.005%·h vs 0.048%·h ± 0.004%·h, P = 0.05). This is the first study to show that protein ingested immediately before sleep is effectively digested and absorbed, thereby stimulating muscle protein synthesis and improving whole-body protein balance during postexercise overnight recovery.",

    "title": "Disinfection of football protective equipment using chlorine dioxide produced by the ICA TriNova system.",
    "abstract": "Community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus outbreaks have occurred in individuals engaged in athletic activities such as wrestling and football. Potential disease reduction interventions include the reduction or elimination of bacteria on common use items such as equipment. Chlorine dioxide has a long history of use as a disinfectant. The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the ability of novel portable chlorine dioxide generation devices to eliminate bacteria contamination of helmets and pads used by individuals engaged in football. In field studies, the number of bacteria associated with heavily used football helmets and shoulder pads was determined before and after overnight treatment with chlorine dioxide gas. Bacteria were recovered using cotton swabs and plated onto trypticase soy agar plates. In laboratory studies, Staphylococcus aureus was applied directly to pads. The penetration of bacteria into the pads was determined by inoculating agar plates with portions of the pads taken from the different layers of padding. The ability to eliminate bacteria on the pad surface and underlying foam layers after treatment with chlorine dioxide was also determined. Rates of recovery of bacteria after treatment clearly demonstrated that chlorine dioxide significantly (p < 0.001) reduce and eliminated bacteria found on the surface of pads. For example, the soft surface of shoulder pads from a university averaged 2.7 x 10(3) recoverable bacteria colonies before chlorine dioxide treatment and 1.3 x 102 recoverable colonies after treatment. In addition, the gas was capable of penetrating the mesh surface layer and killing bacteria in the underlying foam pad layers. Here, 7 x 10(3) to 4.5 x 10(3) laboratory applied S. aureus colonies were recovered from underlying layers before treatment and 0 colonies were present after treatment. Both naturally occurring bacteria and S. aureus were susceptible to the treatment process. Results of this study have shown that chlorine dioxide can easily and safely be used to eliminate bacteria contamination of protective pads used by football players. This could serve to reduce exposure to potential pathogens such as the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus among this group of individuals.",

During this period, weight gains and food intakes were comparable in the four dietary groups. Animals were subjected to cannulation of the left thoracic lymphatic duct, and after an overnight fast, were given a single intragastric dose of a lipid emulsion containing oleic acid and cholesterol. The overall 24-h recoveries of cholesterol and fatty acid in lymph were similar in the four groups, as were the distribution of lipids among the major lipid fractions and lipoprotein classes of thoracic duct lymph. However, analysis of timed lymph collections indicated that absorption of lipids was more rapid in casein-fed rats than in those fed soy protein. Furthermore, addition of arginine to the casein diet resulted in a slowed rate of lipid absorption, and addition of lysine to the soy diet markedly increased the rate of lipid absorption.",
